{"white": {"word": "white", "line": "It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh!\n"}}
{"white": {"word": "white", "line": "won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n"}}
{"white": {"word": "white", "line": "I am so _very_ tired of being all alone here!\u201d As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking.\n"}}

{"white": {"word": "pale", "line": "Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201d When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201cLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201d It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.\n"}}
{"white": {"word": "white", "line": "Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201d Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u2014everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\n"}}
