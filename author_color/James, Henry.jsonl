{"white": {"word": "pale", "line": "She was there for poor scared Mrs. Grose, but she was there most for Flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so extraordinary as that in which I consciously threw out to her\u2014with the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and understand it\u2014an inarticulate message of gratitude.\n"}}
{"pink": {"word": "rose", "line": "She rose erect on the spot my friend and I had lately quitted, and there was not, in all the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short.\n"}}
{"pink": {"word": "pink", "line": "To see her, without a convulsion of her small pink face, not even feign to glance in the direction of the prodigy I announced, but only, instead of that, turn at _me_ an expression of hard, still gravity, an expression absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse and judge me\u2014this was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl herself into the very presence that could make me quail.\n"}}

{"pink": {"word": "blush", "line": "\u201cIt strikes me that by this time your eyes are open even wider than mine.\u201d They proved to be so indeed, but she could still blush, almost, to show it.\n"}}
{"white": {"word": "fair", "line": "I could only get on at all by taking \u201cnature\u201d into my confidence and my account, by treating my monstrous ordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of course, and unpleasant, but demanding, after all, for a fair front, only another turn of the screw of ordinary human virtue.\n"}}
