haste to the wedding      wooed and married and a   edith said margaret gently edith  but as margaret half suspected edith had fallen asleep
she lay curled up on the sofa in the back drawingroom in harley street looking very lovely in her white muslin and blue ribbons
if titania had ever been dressed in white muslin and blue ribbons and had fallen asleep on a crimson damask sofa in a back drawingroom edith might have been taken for her
margaret was struck afresh by her cousins beauty
they had grown up together from childhood and all along edith had been remarked upon by every one except margaret for her prettiness but margaret had never thought about it until the last few days when the prospect of soon losing her companion seemed to give force to every sweet quality and charm which edith possessed
they had been talking about wedding dresses and wedding ceremonies and captain lennox and what he had told edith about her future life at corfu where his regiment was stationed and the difficulty of keeping a piano in good tune a difficulty which edith seemed to consider as one of the most formidable that could befall her in her married life and what gowns she should want in the visits to scotland which would immediately succeed her marriage but the whispered tone had latterly become more drowsy and margaret after a pause of a few minutes found as she fancied that in spite of the buzz in the next room edith had rolled herself up into a soft ball of muslin and ribbon and silken curls and gone off into a peaceful little afterdinner nap
margaret had been on the point of telling her cousin of some of the plans and visions which she entertained as to her future life in the country parsonage where her father and mother lived and where her bright holidays had always been passed though for the last ten years her aunt shaws house had been considered as her home
but in default of a listener she had to brood over the change in her life silently as heretofore
it was a happy brooding although tinged with regret at being separated for an indefinite time from her gentle aunt and dear cousin
as she thought of the delight of filling the important post of only daughter in helstone parsonage pieces of the conversation out of the next room came upon her ears
her aunt shaw was talking to the five or six ladies who had been dining there and whose husbands were still in the diningroom
they were the familiar acquaintances of the house neighbours whom mrs shaw called friends because she happened to dine with them more frequently than with any other people and because if she or edith wanted anything from them or they from her they did not scruple to make a call at each others houses before luncheon
these ladies and their husbands were invited in their capacity of friends to eat a farewell dinner in honour of ediths approaching marriage
edith had rather objected to this arrangement for captain lennox was expected to arrive by a late train this very evening but although she was a spoiled child she was too careless and idle to have a very strong will of her own and gave way when she found that her mother had absolutely ordered those extra delicacies of the season which are always supposed to be efficacious against immoderate grief at farewell dinners
she contented herself by leaning back in her chair merely playing with the food on her plate and looking grave and absent while all around her were enjoying the mots of mr grey the gentleman who always took the bottom of the table at mrs shaws dinner parties and asked edith to give them some music in the drawingroom
mr grey was particularly agreeable over this farewell dinner and the gentlemen staid downstairs longer than usual
it was very well they didto judge from the fragments of conversation which margaret overheard
i suffered too much myself not that i was not extremely happy with the poor dear general but still disparity of age is a drawback one that i was resolved edith should not have to encounter
of course without any maternal partiality i foresaw that the dear child was likely to marry early indeed i had often said that i was sure she would be married before she was nineteen
i had quite prophetic feeling when captain lennoxand here the voice dropped into a whisper but margaret could easily supply the blank
the course of true love in ediths case had run remarkably smooth
mrs shaw had given way to the presentiment as she expressed it and had rather urged on the marriage although it was below the expectations which many of ediths acquaintances had formed for her a young and pretty heiress
but mrs shaw said that her only child should marry for loveand sighed emphatically as if love had not been her motive for marrying the general
mrs shaw enjoyed the romance of the present engagement rather more than her daughter
not but that edith was very thoroughly and properly in love still she would certainly have preferred a good house in belgravia to all the picturesqueness of the life which captain lennox described at corfu
the very parts which made margaret glow as she listened edith pretended to shiver and shudder at partly for the pleasure she had in being coaxed out of her dislike by her fond lover and partly because anything of a gipsy or makeshift life was really distasteful to her
yet had any one come with a fine house and a fine estate and a fine title to boot edith would still have clung to captain lennox while the temptation lasted when it was over it is possible she might have had little qualms of illconcealed regret that captain lennox could not have united in his person everything that was desirable
in this she was but her mothers child who after deliberately marrying general shaw with no warmer feeling than respect for his character and establishment was constantly though quietly bemoaning her hard lot in being united to one whom she could not love
i have spared no expense in her trousseau were the next words margaret heard
she has all the beautiful indian shawls and scarfs the general gave to me but which i shall never wear again  she is a lucky girl replied another voice which margaret knew to be that of mrs gibson a lady who was taking a double interest in the conversation from the fact of one of her daughters having been married within the last few weeks
helen had set her heart upon an indian shawl but really when i found what an extravagant price was asked i was obliged to refuse her
she will be quite envious when she hears of edith having indian shawls
what kind are they
delhi
with the lovely little borders  margaret heard her aunts voice again but this time it was as if she had raised herself up from her halfrecumbent position and were looking into the more dimly lighted back drawingroom
edith
edith cried she and then she sank as if wearied by the exertion
margaret stepped forward
edith is asleep aunt shaw
is it anything i can do  all the ladies said poor child on receiving this distressing intelligence about edith and the minute lapdog in mrs shaws arms began to bark as if excited by the burst of pity
hush tiny
you naughty little girl
you will waken your mistress
it was only to ask edith if she would tell newton to bring down her shawls perhaps you would go margaret dear  margaret went up into the old nursery at the very top of the house where newton was busy getting up some laces which were required for the wedding
while newton went not without a muttered grumbling to undo the shawls which had already been exhibited four or five times that day margaret looked round upon the nursery the first room in that house with which she had become familiar nine years ago when she was brought all untamed from the forest to share the home the play and the lessons of her cousin edith
she remembered the dark dim look of the london nursery presided over by an austere and ceremonious nurse who was terribly particular about clean hands and torn frocks
she recollected the first tea up thereseparate from her father and aunt who were dining somewhere down below an infinite depth of stairs for unless she were up in the sky the child thought they must be deep down in the bowels of the earth
at homebefore she came to live in harley streether mothers dressingroom had been her nursery and as they kept early hours in the country parsonage margaret had always had her meals with her father and mother
oh
well did the tall stately girl of eighteen remember the tears shed with such wild passion of grief by the little girl of nine as she hid her face under the bedclothes in that first night and how she was bidden not to cry by the nurse because it would disturb miss edith and how she had cried as bitterly but more quietly till her newlyseen grand pretty aunt had come softly upstairs with mr hale to show him his little sleeping daughter
then the little margaret had hushed her sobs and tried to lie quiet as if asleep for fear of making her father unhappy by her grief which she dared not express before her aunt and which she rather thought it was wrong to feel at all after the long hoping and planning and contriving they had gone through at home before her wardrobe could be arranged to suit her grander circumstances and before papa could leave his parish to come up to london even for a few days
now she had got to love the old nursery though it was but a dismantled place and she looked all round with a kind of catlike regret at the idea of leaving it for ever in three days
ah newton said she i think we shall all be sorry to leave this dear old room  indeed miss i shant for one
my eyes are not so good as they were and the light here is so bad that i cant see to mend laces except just at the window where theres always a shocking draughtenough to give one ones death of cold  well i dare say you will have both good light and plenty of warmth at naples
you must keep as much of your darning as you can till then
thank you newton i can take them downyoure busy  so margaret went down laden with shawls and snuffing up their spicy eastern smell
her aunt asked her to stand as a sort of lay figure on which to display them as edith was still asleep
no one thought about it but margarets tall finely made figure in the black silk dress which she was wearing as mourning for some distant relative of her fathers set off the long beautiful folds of the gorgeous shawls that would have halfsmothered edith
margaret stood right under the chandelier quite silent and passive while her aunt adjusted the draperies
occasionally as she was turned round she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror over the chimneypiece and smiled at her own appearance therethe familiar features in the usual garb of a princess
she touched the shawls gently as they hung around her and took a pleasure in their soft feel and their brilliant colours and rather liked to be dressed in such splendourenjoying it much as a child would do with a quiet pleased smile on her lips
just then the door opened and mr henry lennox was suddenly announced
some of the ladies started back as if halfashamed of their feminine interest in dress
mrs shaw held out her hand to the newcomer margaret stood perfectly still thinking she might be yet wanted as a sort of block for the shawls but looking at mr lennox with a bright amused face as if sure of his sympathy in her sense of the ludicrousness at being thus surprised
her aunt was so much absorbed in asking mr henry lennoxwho had not been able to come to dinnerall sorts of questions about his brother the bridegroom his sister the bridesmaid coming with the captain from scotland for the occasion and various other members of the lennox family that margaret saw she was no more wanted as shawlbearer and devoted herself to the amusement of the other visitors whom her aunt had for the moment forgotten
almost immediately edith came in from the back drawingroom winking and blinking her eyes at the stronger light shaking back her slightlyruffled curls and altogether looking like the sleeping beauty just startled from her dreams
even in her slumber she had instinctively felt that a lennox was worth rousing herself for and she had a multitude of questions to ask about dear janet the future unseen sisterinlaw for whom she professed so much affection that if margaret had not been very proud she might have almost felt jealous of the mushroom rival
as margaret sank rather more into the background on her aunts joining the conversation she saw henry lennox directing his look towards a vacant seat near her and she knew perfectly well that as soon as edith released him from her questioning he would take possession of that chair
she had not been quite sure from her aunts rather confused account of his engagements whether he would come that night it was almost a surprise to see him and now she was sure of a pleasant evening
he liked and disliked pretty nearly the same things that she did
margarets face was lightened up into an honest open brightness
byandby he came
she received him with a smile which had not a tinge of shyness or selfconsciousness in it
well i suppose you are all in the depth of businessladies business i mean
very different to my business which is the real true law business
playing with shawls is very different work to drawing up settlements  ah i knew how you would be amused to find us all so occupied in admiring finery
but really indian shawls are very perfect things of their kind  i have no doubt they are
their prices are very perfect too
nothing wanting  the gentlemen came dropping in one by one and the buzz and noise deepened in tone
this is your last dinnerparty is it not
there are no more before thursday  no
i think after this evening we shall feel at rest which i am sure i have not done for many weeks at least that kind of rest when the hands have nothing more to do and all the arrangements are complete for an event which must occupy ones head and heart
i shall be glad to have time to think and i am sure edith will  i am not so sure about her but i can fancy that you will
whenever i have seen you lately you have been carried away by a whirlwind of some other persons making  yes said margaret rather sadly remembering the neverending commotion about trifles that had been going on for more than a month past i wonder if a marriage must always be preceded by what you call a whirlwind or whether in some cases there might not rather be a calm and peaceful time just before it  cinderellas godmother ordering the trousseau the weddingbreakfast writing the notes of invitation for instance said mr lennox laughing
but are all these quite necessary troubles asked margaret looking up straight at him for an answer
a sense of indescribable weariness of all the arrangements for a pretty effect in which edith had been busied as supreme authority for the last six weeks oppressed her just now and she really wanted some one to help her to a few pleasant quiet ideas connected with a marriage
oh of course he replied with a change to gravity in his tone
there are forms and ceremonies to be gone through not so much to satisfy oneself as to stop the worlds mouth without which stoppage there would be very little satisfaction in life
but how would you have a wedding arranged  oh i have never thought much about it only i should like it to be a very fine summer morning and i should like to walk to church through the shade of trees and not to have so many bridesmaids and to have no weddingbreakfast
i dare say i am resolving against the very things that have given me the most trouble just now  no i dont think you are
the idea of stately simplicity accords well with your character  margaret did not quite like this speech she winced away from it more from remembering former occasions on which he had tried to lead her into a discussion in which he took the complimentary part about her own character and ways of going on
she cut his speech rather short by saying  it is natural for me to think of helstone church and the walk to it rather than of driving up to a london church in the middle of a paved street  tell me about helstone
you have never described it to me
i should like to have some idea of the place you will be living in when ninetysix harley street will be looking dingy and dirty and dull and shut up
is helstone a village or a town in the first place  oh only a hamlet i dont think i could call it a village at all
there is the church and a few houses near it on the greencottages ratherwith roses growing all over them  and flowering all the year round especially at christmasmake your picture complete said he
no replied margaret somewhat annoyed i am not making a picture
i am trying to describe helstone as it really is
you should not have said that  i am penitent he answered
only it really sounded like a village in a tale rather than in real life  and so it is replied margaret eagerly
all the other places in england that i have seen seem so hard and prosaiclooking after the new forest
helstone is like a village in a poemin one of tennysons poems
but i wont try and describe it any more
you would only laugh at me if i told you what i think of itwhat it really is  indeed i would not
but i see you are going to be very resolved
well then tell me that which i should like still better to know what the parsonage is like  oh i cant describe my home
it is home and i cant put its charm into words  i submit
you are rather severe tonight margaret  how said she turning her large soft eyes round full upon him
i did not know i was  why because i made an unlucky remark you will neither tell me what helstone is like nor will you say anything about your home though i have told you how much i want to hear about both the latter especially  but indeed i cannot tell you about my own home
i dont quite think it is a thing to be talked about unless you knew it  well thenpausing for a momenttell me what you do there
here you read or have lessons or otherwise improve your mind till the middle of the day take a walk before lunch go a drive with your aunt after and have some kind of engagement in the evening
there now fill up your day at helstone
shall you ride drive or walk  walk decidedly
we have no horse not even for papa
he walks to the very extremity of his parish
the walks are so beautiful it would be a shame to drivealmost a shame to ride  shall you garden much
that i believe is a proper employment for young ladies in the country  i dont know
i am afraid i shant like such hard work  archery partiespicnicsrace ballshunt balls  oh no said she laughing
papas living is very small and even if we were near such things i doubt if i should go to them  i see you wont tell me anything
you will only tell me that you are not going to do this and that
before the vacation ends i think i shall pay you a call and see what you really do employ yourself in  i hope you will
then you will see for yourself how beautiful helstone is
now i must go
edith is sitting down to play and i just know enough of music to turn over the leaves for her and besides aunt shaw wont like us to talk  edith played brilliantly
in the middle of the piece the door halfopened and edith saw captain lennox hesitating whether to come in
she threw down her music and rushed out of the room leaving margaret standing confused and blushing to explain to the astonished guests what vision had shown itself to cause ediths sudden flight
captain lennox had come earlier than was expected or was it really so late
they looked at their watches were duly shocked and took their leave
then edith came back glowing with pleasure halfshyly halfproudly leading in her tall handsome captain
his brother shook hands with him and mrs shaw welcomed him in her gentle kindly way which had always something plaintive in it arising from the long habit of considering herself a victim to an uncongenial marriage
now that the general being gone she had every good of life with as few drawbacks as possible she had been rather perplexed to find an anxiety if not a sorrow
she had however of late settled upon her own health as a source of apprehension she had a nervous little cough whenever she thought about it and some complaisant doctor ordered her just what she desireda winter in italy
mrs shaw had as strong wishes as most people but she never liked to do anything from the open and acknowledged motive of her own good will and pleasure she preferred being compelled to gratify herself by some other persons command or desire
she really did persuade herself that she was submitting to some hard external necessity and thus she was able to moan and complain in her soft manner all the time she was in reality doing just what she liked
it was in this way she began to speak of her own journey to captain lennox who assented as in duty bound to all his future motherinlaw said while his eyes sought edith who was busying herself in rearranging the teatable and ordering up all sorts of good things in spite of his assurances that he had dined within the last two hours
mr henry lennox stood leaning against the chimneypiece amused with the family scene
he was close by his handsome brother he was the plain one in a singularly goodlooking family but his face was intelligent keen and mobile and now and then margaret wondered what it was that he could be thinking about while he kept silence but was evidently observing with an interest that was slightly sarcastic all that edith and she were doing
the sarcastic feeling was called out by mrs shaws conversation with his brother it was separate from the interest which was excited by what he saw
he thought it a pretty sight to see the two cousins so busy in their little arrangements about the table
edith chose to do most herself
she was in a humour to enjoy showing her lover how well she could behave as a soldiers wife
she found out that the water in the urn was cold and ordered up the great kitchen teakettle the only consequence of which was that when she met it at the door and tried to carry it in it was too heavy for her and she came in pouting with a black mark on her muslin gown and a little round white hand indented by the handle which she took to show to captain lennox just like a hurt child and of course the remedy was the same in both cases
margarets quicklyadjusted spiritlamp was the most efficacious contrivance though not so like the gypsyencampment which edith in some of her moods chose to consider the nearest resemblance to a barracklife
after this evening all was bustle till the wedding was over
roses and thorns
by the soft green light in the woody glade     on the banks of moss where thy childhood played     by the household tree thro which thine eye     first looked in love to the summer sky                   mrs hemans
margaret was once more in her morning dress travelling quietly home with her father who had come up to assist at the wedding
her mother had been detained at home by a multitude of halfreasons none of which anybody fully understood except mr hale who was perfectly aware that all his arguments in favour of a grey satin gown which was midway between oldness and newness had proved unavailing and that as he had not the money to equip his wife afresh from top to toe she would not show herself at her only sisters only childs wedding
if mrs shaw had guessed at the real reason why mrs hale did not accompany her husband she would have showered down gowns upon her but it was nearly twenty years since mrs shaw had been the poor pretty miss beresford and she had really forgotten all grievances except that of the unhappiness arising from disparity of age in married life on which she could descant by the halfhour
dearest maria had married the man of her heart only eight years older than herself with the sweetest temper and that blue black hair one so seldom sees
mr hale was one of the most delightful preachers she had ever heard and a perfect model of a parish priest
perhaps it was not quite a logical deduction from all these premises but it was still mrs shaws characteristic conclusion as she thought over her sisters lot married for love what can dearest maria have to wish for in this world mrs hale if she spoke truth might have answered with a readymade list a silvergrey glac silk a white chip bonnet oh
dozens of things for the wedding and hundreds of things for the house  margaret only knew that her mother had not found it convenient to come and she was not sorry to think that their meeting and greeting would take place at helstone parsonage rather than during the confusion of the last two or three days in the house in harley street where she herself had had to play the part of figaro and was wanted everywhere at one and the same time
her mind and body ached now with the recollection of all she had done and said within the last fortyeight hours
the farewells so hurriedly taken amongst all the other goodbyes of those she had lived with so long oppressed her now with a sad regret for the times that were no more it did not signify what those times had been they were gone never to return
margarets heart felt more heavy than she could ever have thought it possible in going to her own dear home the place and the life she had longed for for yearsat that time of all times for yearning and longing just before the sharp senses lose their outlines in sleep
she took her mind away with a wrench from the recollection of the past to the bright serene contemplation of the hopeful future
her eyes began to see not visions of what had been but the sight actually before her her dear father leaning back asleep in the railway carriage
his blueblack hair was grey now and lay thinly over his brows
the bones of his face were plainly to be seentoo plainly for beauty if his features had been less finely cut as it was they had a grace if not a comeliness of their own
the face was in repose but it was rather rest after weariness than the serene calm of the countenance of one who led a placid contented life
margaret was painfully struck by the worn anxious expression and she went back over the open and avowed circumstances of her fathers life to find the cause for the lines that spoke so plainly of habitual distress and depression
poor frederick thought she sighing
oh
if frederick had but been a clergyman instead of going into the navy and being lost to us all
i wish i knew all about it
i never understood it from aunt shaw i only knew he could not come back to england because of that terrible affair
poor dear papa
how sad he looks
i am so glad i am going home to be at hand to comfort him and mamma  she was ready with a bright smile in which there was not a trace of fatigue to greet her father when he awakened
he smiled back again but faintly as if it were an unusual exertion
his face returned into its lines of habitual anxiety
he had a trick of halfopening his mouth as if to speak which constantly unsettled the form of the lips and gave the face an undecided expression
but he had the same large soft eyes as his daughtereyes which moved slowly and almost grandly round in their orbits and were well veiled by their transparent white eyelids
margaret was more like him than like her mother
sometimes people wondered that parents so handsome should have a daughter who was so far regularly beautiful not beautiful at all was occasionally said
her mouth was wide no rosebud that could only open just enough to let out a yes and no and ant please you sir but the wide mouth was one soft curve of rich red lips and the skin if not white and fair was of an ivory smoothness and delicacy
if the look on her face was in general too dignified and reserved for one so young now talking to her father it was bright as the morningfull of dimples and glances that spoke of childish gladness and boundless hope in the future
it was the latter part of july when margaret returned home
the forest trees were all one dark full dusky green the fern below them caught all the slanting sunbeams the weather was sultry and broodingly still
margaret used to tramp along by her fathers side crushing down the fern with a cruel glee as she felt it yield under her light foot and send up the fragrance peculiar to itout on the broad commons into the warm scented light seeing multitudes of wild free living creatures revelling in the sunshine and the herbs and flowers it called forth
this lifeat least these walksrealised all margarets anticipations
she took a pride in her forest
its people were her people
she made hearty friends with them learned and delighted in using their peculiar words took up her freedom amongst them nursed their babies talked or read with slow distinctness to their old people carried dainty messes to their sick resolved before long to teach at the school where her father went regularly every day as to an appointed task but she was continually tempted off to go and see some individual friendman woman or childin some cottage in the green shade of the forest
her outofdoors life was perfect
her indoors life had its drawbacks
with the healthy shame of a child she blamed herself for her keenness of sight in perceiving that all was not as it should be there
her motherher mother always so kind and tender towards herseemed now and then so much discontented with their situation thought that the bishop strangely neglected his episcopal duties in not giving mr hale a better living and almost reproached her husband because he could not bring himself to say that he wished to leave the parish and undertake the charge of a larger
he would sigh aloud as he answered that if he could do what he ought in little helstone he should be thankful but every day he was more overpowered the world became more bewildering
at each repeated urgency of his wife that he would put himself in the way of seeking some preferment margaret saw that her father shrank more and more and she strove at such times to reconcile her mother to helstone
mrs hale said that the near neighbourhood of so many trees affected her health and margaret would try to tempt her forth on to the beautiful broad upland sunstreaked cloudshadowed common for she was sure that her mother had accustomed herself too much to an indoors life seldom extending her walks beyond the church the school and the neighbouring cottages
this did good for a time but when the autumn drew on and the weather became more changeable her mothers idea of the unhealthiness of the place increased and she repined even more frequently that her husband who was more learned than mr hume a better parish priest than mr houldsworth should not have met with the preferment that these two former neighbours of theirs had done
this marring of the peace of home by long hours of discontent was what margaret was unprepared for
she knew and had rather revelled in the idea that she should have to give up many luxuries which had only been troubles and trammels to her freedom in harley street
her keen enjoyment of every sensuous pleasure was balanced finely if not overbalanced by her conscious pride in being able to do without them all if need were
but the cloud never comes in that quarter of the horizon from which we watch for it
there had been slight complaints and passing regrets on her mothers part over some trifle connected with helstone and her fathers position there when margaret had been spending her holidays at home before but in the general happiness of the recollection of those times she had forgotten the small details which were not so pleasant
in the latter half of september the autumnal rains and storms came on and margaret was obliged to remain more in the house than she had hitherto done
helstone was at some distance from any neighbours of their own standard of cultivation
it is undoubtedly one of the most outoftheway places in england said mrs hale in one of her plaintive moods
i cant help regretting constantly that papa has really no one to associate with here he is so thrown away seeing no one but farmers and labourers from weeks end to weeks end
if we only lived at the other side of the parish it would be something there we should be almost within walking distance of the stansfields certainly the gormons would be within a walk  gormons said margaret are those the gormons who made their fortunes in trade at southampton
oh
im glad we dont visit them
i dont like shoppy people
i think we are far better off knowing only cottagers and labourers and people without pretence  you must not be so fastidious margaret dear said her mother secretly thinking of a young and handsome mr gormon whom she had once met at mr humes
no
i call mine a very comprehensive taste i like all people whose occupations have to do with land i like soldiers and sailors and the three learned professions as they call them
im sure you dont want me to admire butchers and bakers and candlestickmakers do you mamma  but the gormons were neither butchers nor bakers but very respectable coachbuilders  very well
coachbuilding is a trade all the same and i think a much more useless one than that of butchers or bakers
oh
how tired i used to be of the drives every day in aunt shaws carriage and how i longed to walk  and walk margaret did in spite of the weather
she was so happy out of doors at her fathers side that she almost danced and with the soft violence of the west wind behind her as she crossed some heath she seemed to be borne onwards as lightly and easily as the fallen leaf that was wafted along by the autumnal breeze
but the evenings were rather difficult to fill up agreeably
immediately after tea her father withdrew into his small library and she and her mother were left alone
mrs hale had never cared much for books and had discouraged her husband very early in their married life in his desire of reading aloud to her while she worked
at one time they had tried backgammon as a resource but as mr hale grew to take an increasing interest in his school and his parishioners he found that the interruptions which arose out of these duties were regarded as hardships by his wife not to be accepted as the natural conditions of his profession but to be regretted and struggled against by her as they severally arose
so he withdrew while the children were yet young into his library to spend his evenings if he were at home in reading the speculative and metaphysical books which were his delight
when margaret had been here before she had brought down with her a great box of books recommended by masters or governess and had found the summers day all too short to get through the reading she had to do before her return to town
now there were only the wellbound littleread english classics which were weeded out of her fathers library to fill up the small bookshelves in the drawingroom
thomsons seasons hayleys cowper middletons cicero were by far the lightest newest and most amusing
the bookshelves did not afford much resource
margaret told her mother every particular of her london life to all of which mrs hale listened with interest sometimes amused and questioning at others a little inclined to compare her sisters circumstances of ease and comfort with the narrower means at helstone vicarage
on such evenings margaret was apt to stop talking rather abruptly and listen to the dripdrip of the rain upon the leads of the little bow window
once or twice margaret found herself mechanically counting the repetition of the monotonous sound while she wondered if she might venture to put a question on a subject very near to her heart and ask where frederick was now what he was doing how long it was since they had heard from him
but a consciousness that her mothers delicate health and positive dislike to helstone all dated from the time of the mutiny in which frederick had been engagedthe full account of which margaret had never heard and which now seemed doomed to be buried in sad oblivionmade her pause and turn away from the subject each time she approached it
when she was with her mother her father seemed the best person to apply to for information and when with him she thought that she could speak more easily to her mother
probably there was nothing much to be heard that was new
in one of the letters she had received before leaving harley street her father had told her that they had heard from frederick he was still at rio and very well in health and sent his best love to her which was dry bones but not the living intelligence she longed for
frederick was always spoken of in the rare times when his name was mentioned as poor frederick his room was kept exactly as he had left it and was regularly dusted and put into order by dixon mrs hales maid who touched no other part of the household work but always remembered the day when she had been engaged by lady beresford as ladies maid to sir johns wards the pretty miss beresfords the belles of rutlandshire
dixon had always considered mr hale as the blight which had fallen upon her young ladys prospects in life
if miss beresford had not been in such a hurry to marry a poor country clergyman there was no knowing what she might have become
but dixon was too loyal to desert her in her affliction and downfall alas her married life
she remained with her and was devoted to her interests always considering herself as the good and protecting fairy whose duty it was to baffle the malignant giant mr hale
master frederick had been her favourite and pride and it was with a little softening of her dignified look and manner that she went in weekly to arrange the chamber as carefully as if he might be coming home that very evening
margaret could not help believing that there had been some late intelligence of frederick unknown to her mother which was making her father anxious and uneasy
mrs hale did not seem to perceive any alteration in her husbands looks or ways
his spirits were tender and gentle readily affected by any small piece of intelligence concerning the welfare of others
he would be depressed for many days after witnessing a deathbed or hearing of any crime
but now margaret noticed an absence of mind as if his thoughts were preoccupied by some subject the oppression of which could not be relieved by any daily action such as comforting the survivors or teaching at the school in hope of lessening the evils in the generation to come
mr hale did not go out among his parishioners as much as usual he was more shut up in his study was anxious for the village postman whose summons to the household was a rap on the backkitchen window shuttera signal which at one time had often to be repeated before any one was sufficiently alive to the hour of the day to understand what it was and attend to him
now mr hale loitered about the garden if the morning was fine and if not stood dreamily by the study window until the postman had called or gone down the lane giving a halfrespectful halfconfidential shake of the head to the parson who watched him away from the sweetbriar hedge and past the great arbutus before he turned into the room to begin his days work with all the signs of a heavy heart and an occupied mind
but margaret was at an age when any apprehension not absolutely based on a knowledge of facts is easily banished for a time by a bright sunny day or some happy outward circumstance
and when the brilliant fourteen fine days of october came on her cares were all blown away as lightly as thistledown and she thought of nothing but the glories of the forest
the fernharvest was over and now that the rain was gone many a deep glade was accessible into which margaret had only peeped in july and august weather
she had learnt drawing with edith and she had sufficiently regretted during the gloom of the bad weather her idle revelling in the beauty of the woodlands while it had yet been fine to make her determined to sketch what she could before winter fairly set in
accordingly she was busy preparing her board one morning when sarah the housemaid threw wide open the drawingroom door and announced mr
henry lennox      the more haste the worse speed      learn to win a ladys faith       nobly as the thing is high     bravely as for life and death       with a loyal gravity
lead her from the festive boards       point her to the starry skies     guard her by your truthful words       pure from courtships flatteries                        mrs browning
mr
henry lennox margaret had been thinking of him only a moment before and remembering his inquiry into her probable occupations at home
it was parler du soleil et lon en voit les rayons and the brightness of the sun came over margarets face as she put down her board and went forward to shake hands with him
tell mamma sarah said she
mamma and i want to ask you so many questions about edith i am so much obliged to you for coming  did not i say that i should asked he in a lower tone than that in which he had spoken
but i heard of you so far away in the highlands that i never thought hampshire could come in  oh said he more lightly our young couple were playing such foolish pranks running all sorts of risks climbing this mountain sailing on that lake that i really thought they needed a mentor to take care of them
and indeed they did they were quite beyond my uncles management and kept the old gentleman in a panic for sixteen hours out of the twentyfour
indeed when i once saw how unfit they were to be trusted alone i thought it my duty not to leave them till i had seen them safely embarked at plymouth  have you been at plymouth
oh
edith never named that
to be sure she has written in such a hurry lately
did they really sail on tuesday  really sailed and relieved me from many responsibilities
edith gave me all sorts of messages for you
i believe i have a little diminutive note somewhere yes here it is  oh
thank you exclaimed margaret and then half wishing to read it alone and unwatched she made the excuse of going to tell her mother again sarah surely had made some mistake that mr lennox was there
when she had left the room he began in his scrutinising way to look about him
the little drawingroom was looking its best in the streaming light of the morning sun
the middle window in the bow was opened and clustering roses and the scarlet honeysuckle came peeping round the corner the small lawn was gorgeous with verbenas and geraniums of all bright colours
but the very brightness outside made the colours within seem poor and faded
the carpet was far from new the chintz had been often washed the whole apartment was smaller and shabbier than he had expected as background and framework for margaret herself so queenly
he took up one of the books lying on the table it was the paradise of dante in the proper old italian binding of white vellum and gold by it lay a dictionary and some words copied out in margarets handwriting
they were a dull list of words but somehow he liked looking at them
he put them down with a sigh
the living is evidently as small as she said
it seems strange for the beresfords belong to a good family  margaret meanwhile had found her mother
it was one of mrs hales fitful days when everything was a difficulty and a hardship and mr lennoxs appearance took this shape although secretly she felt complimented by his thinking it worth while to call
it is most unfortunate
we are dining early today and having nothing but cold meat in order that the servants may get on with their ironing and yet of course we must ask him to dinnerediths brotherinlaw and all
and your papa is in such low spirits this morning about somethingi dont know what
i went into the study just now and he had his face on the table covering it with his hands
i told him i was sure helstone air did not agree with him any more than with me and he suddenly lifted up his head and begged me not to speak a word more against helstone he could not bear it if there was one place he loved on earth it was helstone
but i am sure for all that it is the damp and relaxing air  margaret felt as if a thin cold cloud had come between her and the sun
she had listened patiently in hopes that it might be some relief to her mother to unburden herself but now it was time to draw her back to mr lennox
papa likes mr lennox they got on together famously at the wedding breakfast
i daresay his coming will do papa good
and never mind the dinner dear mamma
cold meat will do capitally for a lunch which is the light in which mr lennox will most likely look upon a two oclock dinner  but what are we to do with him till then
it is only halfpast ten now  ill ask him to go out sketching with me
i know he draws and that will take him out of your way mamma
only do come in now he will think it so strange if you dont  mrs hale took off her black silk apron and smoothed her face
she looked a very pretty ladylike woman as she greeted mr lennox with the cordiality due to one who was almost a relation
he evidently expected to be asked to spend the day and accepted the invitation with a glad readiness that made mrs hale wish she could add something to the cold beef
he was pleased with everything delighted with margarets idea of going out sketching together would not have mr hale disturbed for the world with the prospect of so soon meeting him at dinner
margaret brought out her drawing materials for him to choose from and after the paper and brushes had been duly selected the two set out in the merriest spirits in the world
now please just stop here for a minute or two said margaret
these are the cottages that haunted me so during the rainy fortnight reproaching me for not having sketched them  before they tumbled down and were no more seen
truly if they are to be sketchedand they are very picturesquewe had better not put it off till next year
but where shall we sit  oh
you might have come straight from chambers in the temple instead of having been two months in the highlands
look at this beautiful trunk of a tree which the woodcutters have left just in the right place for the light
i will put my plaid over it and it will be a regular forest throne  with your feet in that puddle for a regal footstool
stay i will move and then you can come nearer this way
who lives in these cottages  they were built by squatters fifty or sixty years ago
one is uninhabited the foresters are going to take it down as soon as the other is dead poor old fellow
lookthere he isi must go and speak to him
he is so deaf you will hear all our secrets  the old man stood bareheaded in the sun leaning on his stick at the front of his cottage
his stiff features relaxed into a slow smile as margaret went up and spoke to him
mr lennox hastily introduced the two figures into his sketch and finished up the landscape with a subordinate reference to themas margaret perceived when the time came for getting up putting away water and scraps of paper and exhibiting to each other their sketches
she laughed and blushed mr lennox watched her countenance
now i call that treacherous said she
i little thought that you were making old isaac and me into subjects when you told me to ask him the history of these cottages  it was irresistible
you cant know how strong a temptation it was
i hardly dare tell you how much i shall like this sketch  he was not quite sure whether she heard this latter sentence before she went to the brook to wash her palette
she came back rather flushed but looking perfectly innocent and unconscious
he was glad of it for the speech had slipped from him unawaresa rare thing in the case of a man who premeditated his actions so much as henry lennox
the aspect of home was all right and bright when they reached it
the clouds on her mothers brow had cleared off under the propitious influence of a brace of carp most opportunely presented by a neighbour
mr hale had returned from his mornings round and was awaiting his visitor just outside the wicket gate that led into the garden
he looked a complete gentleman in his rather threadbare coat and wellworn hat
margaret was proud of her father she had always a fresh and tender pride in seeing how favourably he impressed every stranger still her quick eye sought over his face and found there traces of some unusual disturbance which was only put aside not cleared away
mr hale asked to look at their sketches
i think you have made the tints on the thatch too dark have you not as he returned margarets to her and held out his hand for mr lennoxs which was withheld from him one moment no more
no papa
i dont think i have
the houseleek and stonecrop have grown so much darker in the rain
is it not like papa said she peeping over his shoulder as he looked at the figures in mr lennoxs drawing
yes very like
your figure and way of holding yourself is capital
and it is just poor old isaacs stiff way of stooping his long rheumatic back
what is this hanging from the branch of the tree
not a birds nest surely  oh no
that is my bonnet
i never can draw with my bonnet on it makes my head so hot
i wonder if i could manage figures
there are so many people about here whom i should like to sketch  i should say that a likeness you very much wish to take you would always succeed in said mr lennox
i have great faith in the power of will
i think myself i have succeeded pretty well in yours mr hale had preceded them into the house while margaret was lingering to pluck some roses with which to adorn her morning gown for dinner
a regular london girl would understand the implied meaning of that speech thought mr lennox
she would be up to looking through every speech that a young man made her for the arrirepense of a compliment
but i dont believe margaretstay exclaimed he let me help you and he gathered for her some velvety cramoisy roses that were above her reach and then dividing the spoil he placed two in his buttonhole and sent her in pleased and happy to arrange her flowers
the conversation at dinner flowed on quietly and agreeably
there were plenty of questions to be asked on both sidesthe latest intelligence which each could give of mrs shaws movements in italy to be exchanged and in the interest of what was said the unpretending simplicity of the parsonagewaysabove all in the neighbourhood of margaret mr lennox forgot the little feeling of disappointment with which he had at first perceived that she had spoken but the simple truth when she had described her fathers living as very small
margaret my child you might have gathered us some pears for our dessert said mr hale as the hospitable luxury of a freshlydecanted bottle of wine was placed on the table
mrs hale was hurried
it seemed as if desserts were impromptu and unusual things at the parsonage whereas if mr hale would only have looked behind him he would have seen biscuits and marmalade and what not all arranged in formal order on the sideboard
but the idea of pears had taken possession of mr hales mind and was not to be got rid of
there are a few brown beurrs against the south wall which are worth all foreign fruits and preserves
run margaret and gather some  i propose that we adjourn into the garden and eat them there said mr lennox
nothing is so delicious as to set ones teeth into the crisp juicy fruit warm and scented by the sun
the worst is the wasps are impudent enough to dispute it with one even at the very crisis and summit of enjoyment  he rose as if to follow margaret who had disappeared through the window he only awaited mrs hales permission
she would rather have wound up the dinner in the proper way and with all the ceremonies which had gone on so smoothly hitherto especially as she and dixon had got out the fingerglasses from the storeroom on purpose to be as correct as became general shaws widows sister but as mr hale got up directly and prepared to accompany his guest she could only submit
i shall arm myself with a knife said mr hale the days of eating fruit so primitively as you describe are over with me
i must pare it and quarter it before i can enjoy it  margaret made a plate for the pears out of a beetroot leaf which threw up their brown gold colour admirably
mr lennox looked more at her than at the pears but her father inclined to cull fastidiously the very zest and perfection of the hour he had stolen from his anxiety chose daintily the ripest fruit and sat down on the garden bench to enjoy it at his leisure
margaret and mr lennox strolled along the little terracewalk under the south wall where the bees still hummed and worked busily in their hives
what a perfect life you seem to live here
i have always felt rather contemptuously towards the poets before with their wishes mine be a cot beside a hill and that sort of thing but now i am afraid that the truth is i have been nothing better than a cockney
just now i feel as if twenty years hard study of law would be amply rewarded by one year of such an exquisite serene life as thissuch skies looking upsuch crimson and amber foliage so perfectly motionless as that pointing to some of the great forest trees which shut in the garden as if it were a nest
you must please to remember that our skies are not always as deep a blue as they are now
we have rain and our leaves do fall and get sodden though i think helstone is about as perfect a place as any in the world
recollect how you rather scorned my description of it one evening in harley street a village in a tale  scorned margaret
that is rather a hard word  perhaps it is
only i know i should have liked to have talked to you of what i was very full at the time and youwhat must i call it thenspoke disrespectfully of helstone as a mere village in a tale  i will never do so again said he warmly
they turned the corner of the walk
i could almost wish margaret he stopped and hesitated
it was so unusual for the fluent lawyer to hesitate that margaret looked up at him in a little state of questioning wonder but in an instantfrom what about him she could not tellshe wished herself back with her motherher fatheranywhere away from him for she was sure he was going to say something to which she should not know what to reply
in another moment the strong pride that was in her came to conquer her sudden agitation which she hoped he had not perceived
of course she could answer and answer the right thing and it was poor and despicable of her to shrink from hearing any speech as if she had not power to put an end to it with her high maidenly dignity
margaret said he taking her by surprise and getting sudden possession of her hand so that she was forced to stand still and listen despising herself for the fluttering at her heart all the time margaret i wish you did not like helstone so muchdid not seem so perfectly calm and happy here
i have been hoping for these three months past to find you regretting londonand london friends a littleenough to make you listen more kindly for she was quietly but firmly striving to extricate her hand from his grasp to one who has not much to offer it is truenothing but prospects in the futurebut who does love you margaret almost in spite of himself
margaret have i startled you too much
speak for he saw her lips quivering almost as if she were going to cry
she made a strong effort to be calm she would not speak till she had succeeded in mastering her voice and then she said  i was startled
i did not know that you cared for me in that way
i have always thought of you as a friend and please i would rather go on thinking of you so
i dont like to be spoken to as you have been doing
i cannot answer you as you want me to do and yet i should feel so sorry if i vexed you  margaret said he looking into her eyes which met his with their open straight look expressive of the utmost good faith and reluctance to give pain do youhe was going to saylove any one else but it seemed as if this question would be an insult to the pure serenity of those eyes
forgive me
i have been too abrupt
i am punished
only let me hope
give me the poor comfort of telling me you have never seen any one whom you could again a pause
he could not end his sentence
margaret reproached herself acutely as the cause of his distress
ah
if you had but never got this fancy into your head
it was such a pleasure to think of you as a friend  but i may hope may i not margaret that some time you will think of me as a lover
not yet i seethere is no hurrybut some time  she was silent for a minute or two trying to discover the truth as it was in her own heart before replying then she said  i have never thought ofyou but as a friend
i like to think of you so but i am sure i could never think of you as anything else
pray let us both forget that all this disagreeable she was going to say but stopped short conversation has taken place  he paused before he replied
then in his habitual coldness of tone he answered  of course as your feelings are so decided and as this conversation has been so evidently unpleasant to you it had better not be remembered
that is all very fine in theory that plan of forgetting whatever is painful but it will be somewhat difficult for me at least to carry it into execution  you are vexed said she sadly yet how can i help it  she looked so truly grieved as she said this that he struggled for a moment with his real disappointment and then answered more cheerfully but still with a little hardness in his tone  you should make allowances for the mortification not only of a lover margaret but of a man not given to romance in generalprudent worldly as some people call mewho has been carried out of his usual habits by the force of a passionwell we will say no more of that but in the one outlet which he has formed for the deeper and better feelings of his nature he meets with rejection and repulse
i shall have to console myself with scorning my own folly
a struggling barrister to think of matrimony  margaret could not answer this
the whole tone of it annoyed her
it seemed to touch on and call out all the points of difference which had often repelled her in him while yet he was the pleasantest man the most sympathising friend the person of all others who understood her best in harley street
she felt a tinge of contempt mingle itself with her pain at having refused him
her beautiful lip curled in a slight disdain
it was well that having made the round of the garden they came suddenly upon mr hale whose whereabouts had been quite forgotten by them
he had not yet finished the pear which he had delicately peeled in one long strip of silverpaper thinness and which he was enjoying in a deliberate manner
it was like the story of the eastern king who dipped his head into a basin of water at the magicians command and ere he instantly took it out went through the experience of a lifetime
margaret felt stunned and unable to recover her selfpossession enough to join in the trivial conversation that ensued between her father and mr lennox
she was grave and little disposed to speak full of wonder when mr lennox would go and allow her to relax into thought on the events of the last quarter of an hour
he was almost as anxious to take his departure as she was for him to leave but a few minutes light and careless talking carried on at whatever effort was a sacrifice which he owed to his mortified vanity or his selfrespect
he glanced from time to time at her sad and pensive face
i am not so indifferent to her as she believes thought he to himself
i do not give up hope  before a quarter of an hour was over he had fallen into a way of conversing with quiet sarcasm speaking of life in london and life in the country as if he were conscious of his second mocking self and afraid of his own satire
mr hale was puzzled
his visitor was a different man to what he had seen him before at the weddingbreakfast and at dinner today a lighter cleverer more worldly man and as such dissonant to mr hale
it was a relief to all three when mr lennox said that he must go directly if he meant to catch the five oclock train
they proceeded to the house to find mrs hale and wish her goodbye
at the last moment henry lennoxs real self broke through the crust
margaret dont despise me i have a heart notwithstanding all this goodfornothing way of talking
as a proof of it i believe i love you more than everif i do not hate youfor the disdain with which you have listened to me during this last halfhour
goodbye margaretmargaret      doubts and difficulties
cast me upon some naked shore     where i may tracke     only the print of some sad wracke     if thou be there though the seas roare     i shall no gentler calm implore               habington
he was gone
the house was shut up for the evening
no more deep blue skies or crimson and amber tints
margaret went up to dress for the early tea finding dixon in a pretty temper from the interruption which a visitor had naturally occasioned on a busy day
she showed it by brushing away viciously at margarets hair under pretence of being in a great hurry to go to mrs hale
yet after all margaret had to wait a long time in the drawingroom before her mother came down
she sat by herself at the fire with unlighted candles on the table behind her thinking over the day the happy walk happy sketching cheerful pleasant dinner and the uncomfortable miserable walk in the garden
how different men were to women
here was she disturbed and unhappy because her instinct had made anything but a refusal impossible while he not many minutes after he had met with a rejection of what ought to have been the deepest holiest proposal of his life could speak as if briefs success and all its superficial consequences of a good house clever and agreeable society were the sole avowed objects of his desires
oh dear
how she could have loved him if he had but been different with a difference which she felt on reflection to be one that went lowdeep down
then she took it into her head that after all his lightness might be but assumed to cover a bitterness of disappointment which would have been stamped on her own heart if she had loved and been rejected
her mother came into the room before this whirl of thoughts was adjusted into anything like order
margaret had to shake off the recollections of what had been done and said through the day and turn a sympathising listener to the account of how dixon had complained that the ironingblanket had been burnt again and how susan lightfoot had been seen with artificial flowers in her bonnet thereby giving evidence of a vain and giddy character
mr hale sipped his tea in abstracted silence margaret had the responses all to herself
she wondered how her father and mother could be so forgetful so regardless of their companion through the day as never to mention his name
she forgot that he had not made them an offer
after tea mr hale got up and stood with his elbow on the chimneypiece leaning his head on his hand musing over something and from time to time sighing deeply
mrs hale went out to consult with dixon about some winter clothing for the poor
margaret was preparing her mothers worsted work and rather shrinking from the thought of the long evening and wishing bedtime were come that she might go over the events of the day again
margaret said mr hale at last in a sort of sudden desperate way that made her start
is that tapestry thing of immediate consequence
i mean can you leave it and come into my study
i want to speak to you about something very serious to us all  very serious to us all mr lennox had never had the opportunity of having any private conversation with her father after her refusal or else that would indeed be a very serious affair
in the first place margaret felt guilty and ashamed of having grown so much into a woman as to be thought of in marriage and secondly she did not know if her father might not be displeased that she had taken upon herself to decline mr lennoxs proposal
but she soon felt it was not about anything which having only lately and suddenly occurred could have given rise to any complicated thoughts that her father wished to speak to her
he made her take a chair by him he stirred the fire snuffed the candles and sighed once or twice before he could make up his mind to sayand it came out with a jerk after allmargaret
i am going to leave helstone  leave helstone papa
but why  mr hale did not answer for a minute or two
he played with some papers on the table in a nervous and confused manner opening his lips to speak several times but closing them again without having the courage to utter a word
margaret could not bear the sight of the suspense which was even more distressing to her father than to herself
but why dear papa
do tell me  he looked up at her suddenly and then said with a slow and enforced calmness  because i must no longer be a minister in the church of england  margaret had imagined nothing less than that some of the preferments which her mother had so much desired had befallen her father at lastsomething that would force him to leave beautiful beloved helstone and perhaps compel him to go and live in some of the stately and silent closes which margaret had seen from time to time in cathedral towns
they were grand and imposing places but if to go there it was necessary to leave helstone as a home for ever that would have been a sad long lingering pain
but nothing to the shock she received from mr hales last speech
what could he mean
it was all the worse for being so mysterious
the aspect of piteous distress on his face almost imploring a merciful and kind judgment from his child gave her a sudden sickening
could he have become implicated in anything frederick had done
frederick was an outlaw
had her father out of a natural love for his son connived at any  oh
what is it
do speak papa
tell me all
why can you no longer be a clergyman
surely if the bishop were told all we know about frederick and the hard unjust  it is nothing about frederick the bishop would have nothing to do with that
it is all myself
margaret i will tell you about it
i will answer any questions this once but after tonight let us never speak of it again
i can meet the consequences of my painful miserable doubts but it is an effort beyond me to speak of what has caused me so much suffering  doubts papa
doubts as to religion asked margaret more shocked than ever
no
not doubts as to religion not the slightest injury to that  he paused
margaret sighed as if standing on the verge of some new horror
he began again speaking rapidly as if to get over a set task  you could not understand it all if i told youmy anxiety for years past to know whether i had any right to hold my livingmy efforts to quench my smouldering doubts by the authority of the church
oh
margaret how i love the holy church from which i am to be shut out he could not go on for a moment or two
margaret could not tell what to say it seemed to her as terribly mysterious as if her father were about to turn mahometan
i have been reading today of the two thousand who were ejected from their churchescontinued mr hale smiling faintlytrying to steal some of their bravery but it is of no useno usei cannot help feeling it acutely  but papa have you well considered
oh
it seems so terrible so shocking said margaret suddenly bursting into tears
the one staid foundation of her home of her idea of her beloved father seemed reeling and rocking
what could she say
what was to be done
the sight of her distress made mr hale nerve himself in order to try and comfort her
he swallowed down the dry choking sobs which had been heaving up from his heart hitherto and going to his bookcase he took down a volume which he had often been reading lately and from which he thought he had derived strength to enter upon the course in which he was now embarked
listen dear margaret said he putting one arm round her waist
she took his hand in hers and grasped it tight but she could not lift up her head nor indeed could she attend to what he read so great was her internal agitation
this is the soliloquy of one who was once a clergyman in a country parish like me it was written by mr oldfield minister of carsington in derbyshire a hundred and sixty years ago or more
his trials are over
he fought the good fight these last two sentences he spoke low as if to himself
then he read aloud  when thou canst no longer continue in thy work without dishonour to god discredit to religion foregoing thy integrity wounding conscience spoiling thy peace and hazarding the loss of thy salvation in a word when the conditions upon which thou must continue if thou wilt continue in thy employments are sinful and unwarranted by the word of god thou mayest yea thou must believe that god will turn thy very silence suspension deprivation and laying aside to his glory and the advancement of the gospels interest
when god will not use thee in one kind yet he will in another
a soul that desires to serve and honour him shall never want opportunity to do it nor must thou so limit the holy one of israel as to think he hath but one way in which he can glorify himself by thee
he can do it by thy silence as well as by thy preaching the laying aside as well as thy continuance in thy work
it is not pretence of doing god the greatest service or performing the weightiest duty that will excuse the least sin though that sin capacitated or gave us the opportunity for doing that duty
thou wilt have little thanks o my soul
if when thou art charged with corrupting gods worship falsifying thy vows thou pretendest a necessity for it in order to a continuance in the ministry  as he read this and glanced at much more which he did not read he gained resolution for himself and felt as if he too could be brave and firm in doing what he believed to be right but as he ceased he heard margarets low convulsive sob and his courage sank down under the keen sense of suffering
margaret dear said he drawing her closer think of the early martyrs think of the thousands who have suffered  but father said she suddenly lifting up her flushed tearwet face the early martyrs suffered for the truth while youoh
dear dear papa  i suffer for conscience sake my child said he with a dignity that was only tremulous from the acute sensitiveness of his character i must do what my conscience bids
i have borne long with selfreproach that would have roused any mind less torpid and cowardly than mine he shook his head as he went on
your poor mothers fond wish gratified at last in the mocking way in which overfond wishes are too often fulfilledsodom apples as they arehas brought on this crisis for which i ought to be and i hope i am thankful
it is not a month since the bishop offered me another living if i had accepted it i should have had to make a fresh declaration of conformity to the liturgy at my institution
margaret i tried to do it i tried to content myself with simply refusing the additional preferment and stopping quietly herestrangling my conscience now as i had strained it before
god forgive me  he rose and walked up and down the room speaking low words of selfreproach and humiliation of which margaret was thankful to hear but few
at last he said  margaret i return to the old sad burden we must leave helstone  yes
i see
but when  i have written to the bishopi dare say i have told you so but i forget things just now said mr hale collapsing into his depressed manner as soon as he came to talk of hard matteroffact details informing him of my intention to resign this vicarage
he has been most kind he has used arguments and expostulations all in vainin vain
they are but what i have tried upon myself without avail
i shall have to take my deed of resignation and wait upon the bishop myself to bid him farewell
that will be a trial
but worse far worse will be the parting from my dear people
there is a curate appointed to read prayersa mr brown
he will come to stay with us tomorrow
next sunday i preach my farewell sermon  was it to be so sudden then
thought margaret and yet perhaps it was as well
lingering would only add stings to the pain it was better to be stunned into numbness by hearing of all these arrangements which seemed to be nearly completed before she had been told
what does mamma say asked she with a deep sigh
to her surprise her father began to walk about again before he answered
at length he stopped and replied  margaret i am a poor coward after all
i cannot bear to give pain
i know so well your mothers married life has not been all she hopedall she had a right to expectand this will be such a blow to her that i have never had the heart the power to tell her
she must be told though now said he looking wistfully at his daughter
margaret was almost overpowered with the idea that her mother knew nothing of it all and yet the affair was so far advanced
yes indeed she must said margaret
perhaps after all she may notoh yes
she will she must be shockedas the force of the blow returned upon herself in trying to realise how another would take it
where are we to go to said she at last struck with a fresh wonder as to their future plans if plans indeed her father had
to miltonnorthern he answered with a dull indifference for he had perceived that although his daughters love had made her cling to him and for a moment strive to soothe him with her love yet the keenness of the pain was as fresh as ever in her mind
miltonnorthern
the manufacturing town in darkshire  yes said he in the same despondent indifferent way
why there papa asked she
because there i can earn bread for my family
because i know no one there and no one knows helstone or can ever talk to me about it  bread for your family
i thought you and mamma hadand then she stopped checking her natural interest regarding their future life as she saw the gathering gloom on her fathers brow
but he with his quick intuitive sympathy read in her face as in a mirror the reflections of his own moody depression and turned it off with an effort
you shall be told all margaret
only help me to tell your mother
i think i could do anything but that the idea of her distress turns me sick with dread
if i tell you all perhaps you could break it to her tomorrow
i am going out for the day to bid farmer dobson and the poor people on bracy common goodbye
would you dislike breaking it to her very much margaret  margaret did dislike it did shrink from it more than from anything she had ever had to do in her life before
she could not speak all at once
her father said you dislike it very much dont you margaret then she conquered herself and said with a bright strong look on her face  it is a painful thing but it must be done and i will do it as well as ever i can
you must have many painful things to do  mr hale shook his head despondingly he pressed her hand in token of gratitude
margaret was nearly upset again into a burst of crying
to turn her thoughts she said now tell me papa what our plans are
you and mamma have some money independent of the income from the living have you not
aunt shaw has i know  yes
i suppose we have about a hundred and twenty pounds a year of our own
seventy of that has always gone to frederick since he has been abroad
i dont know if he wants it all he continued in a hesitating manner
he must have some pay for serving with the spanish army  frederick must not suffer said margaret decidedly in a foreign country so unjustly treated by his own
a hundred is left
could not you and i and mamma live on a hundred a year in some very cheapvery quiet part of england
oh
i think we could  no said mr hale
that would not answer
i must do something
i must make myself busy to keep off morbid thoughts
besides in a country parish i should be so painfully reminded of helstone and my duties here
i could not bear it margaret
and a hundred a year would go a very little way after the necessary wants of housekeeping are met towards providing your mother with all the comforts she has been accustomed to and ought to have
no we must go to milton
that is settled
i can always decide better by myself and not influenced by those whom i love said he as a half apology for having arranged so much before he had told any one of his family of his intentions
i cannot stand objections
they make me so undecided  margaret resolved to keep silence
after all what did it signify where they went compared to the one terrible change
mr hale continued a few months ago when my misery of doubt became more than i could bear without speaking i wrote to mr bellyou remember mr bell margaret  no i never saw him i think
but i know who he is
fredericks godfatheryour old tutor at oxford dont you mean  yes
he is a fellow of plymouth college there
he is a native of miltonnorthern i believe
at any rate he has property there which has very much increased in value since milton has become such a large manufacturing town
well i had reason to suspectto imaginei had better say nothing about it however
but i felt sure of sympathy from mr bell
i dont know that he gave me much strength
he has lived an easy life in his college all his days
but he has been as kind as can be
and it is owing to him we are going to milton  how said margaret
why he has tenants and houses and mills there so though he dislikes the placetoo bustling for one of his habitshe is obliged to keep up some sort of connection and he tells me that he hears there is a good opening for a private tutor there  a private tutor said margaret looking scornful what in the world do manufacturers want with the classics or literature or the accomplishments of a gentleman  oh said her father some of them really seem to be fine fellows conscious of their own deficiencies which is more than many a man at oxford is
some want resolutely to learn though they have come to mans estate
some want their children to be better instructed than they themselves have been
at any rate there is an opening as i have said for a private tutor
mr bell has recommended me to a mr thornton a tenant of his and a very intelligent man as far as i can judge from his letters
and in milton margaret i shall find a busy life if not a happy one and people and scenes so different that i shall never be reminded of helstone  there was the secret motive as margaret knew from her own feelings
it would be different
discordant as it waswith almost a detestation for all she had ever heard of the north of england the manufacturers the people the wild and bleak countrythere was this one recommendationit would be different to helstone and could never remind them of that beloved place
when do we go asked margaret after a short silence
i do not know exactly
i wanted to talk it over with you
you see your mother knows nothing about it yet but i think in a fortnightafter my deed of resignation is sent in i shall have no right to remain  margaret was almost stunned
in a fortnight  nono not exactly to a day
nothing is fixed said her father with anxious hesitation as he noticed the filmy sorrow that came over her eyes and the sudden change in her complexion
but she recovered herself immediately
yes papa it had better be fixed soon and decidedly as you say
only mamma to know nothing about it
it is that that is the great perplexity  poor maria replied mr hale tenderly
poor poor maria
oh if i were not marriedif i were but myself in the world how easy it would be
as it ismargaret i dare not tell her  no said margaret sadly i will do it
give me till tomorrow evening to choose my time
oh papa cried she with sudden passionate entreaty saytell me it is a nightmarea horrid dreamnot the real waking truth
you cannot mean that you are really going to leave the churchto give up helstoneto be for ever separate from me from mammaled away by some delusionsome temptation
you do not really mean it  mr hale sat in rigid stillness while she spoke
then he looked her in the face and said in a slow hoarse measured wayi do mean it margaret
you must not deceive yourself in doubting the reality of my wordsmy fixed intention and resolve he looked at her in the same steady stony manner for some moments after he had done speaking
she too gazed back with pleading eyes before she would believe it was irrevocable
then she arose and went without another word or look towards the door
as her fingers were on the handle he called her back
he was standing by the fireplace shrunk and stooping but as she came near he drew himself up to his full height and placing his hands on her head he said solemnly  the blessing of god be upon thee my child  and may he restore you to his church responded she out of the fulness of her heart
the next moment she feared lest this answer to his blessing might be irreverent wrongmight hurt him as coming from his daughter and she threw her arms round his neck
he held her to him for a minute or two
she heard him murmur to himself the martyrs and confessors had even more pain to beari will not shrink  they were startled by hearing mrs hale inquiring for her daughter
they started asunder in the full consciousness of all that was before them
mr hale hurriedly said go margaret go
i shall be out all tomorrow
before night you will have told your mother  yes she replied and she returned to the drawingroom in a stunned and dizzy state
decision
i ask thee for a thoughtful love       through constant watching wise     to meet the glad with joyful smiles       and to wipe the weeping eyes     and a heart at leisure from itself       to soothe and sympathise                   anon
margaret made a good listener to all her mothers little plans for adding some small comforts to the lot of the poorest parishioners
she could not help listening though each new project was a stab to her heart
by the time the frost had set in they should be far away from helstone
old simons rheumatism might be bad and his eyesight worse there would be no one to go and read to him and comfort him with little porringers of broth and good red flannel or if there was it would be a stranger and the old man would watch in vain for her
mary domvilles little crippled boy would crawl in vain to the door and look for her coming through the forest
these poor friends would never understand why she had forsaken them and there were many others besides
papa has always spent the income he derived from his living in the parish
i am perhaps encroaching upon the next dues but the winter is likely to be severe and our poor people must be helped  oh mamma let us do all we can said margaret eagerly not seeing the prudential side of the question only grasping at the idea that they were rendering such help for the last time we may not be here long  do you feel ill my darling asks mrs hale anxiously misunderstanding margarets hint of the uncertainty of their stay at helstone
you look pale and tired
it is this soft damp unhealthy air  nono mamma it is not that it is delicious air
it smells of the freshest purest fragrance after the smokiness of harley street
but i am tired it surely must be near bedtime  not far offit is halfpast nine
you had better go to bed at once dear
ask dixon for some gruel
i will come and see you as soon as you are in bed
i am afraid you have taken cold or the bad air from some of the stagnant ponds  oh mamma said margaret faintly smiling as she kissed her mother i am quite welldont alarm yourself about me i am only tired  margaret went up stairs
to soothe her mothers anxiety she submitted to a basin of gruel
she was lying languidly in bed when mrs hale came up to make some last inquiries and kiss her before going to her own room for the night
but the instant she heard her mothers door locked she sprang out of bed and throwing her dressinggown on she began to pace up and down the room until the creaking of one of the boards reminded her that she must make no noise
she went and curled herself upon the windowseat in the small deeplyrecessed window
that morning when she had looked out her heart had danced at seeing the bright clear lights on the church tower which foretold a fine and sunny day
this eveningsixteen hours at most had past byshe sat down too full of sorrow to cry but with a cold dull pain which seemed to have pressed the youth and buoyancy out of her heart never to return
mr henry lennoxs visithis offerwas like a dream a thing beside her actual life
the hard reality was that her father had so admitted tempting doubts into his mind as to become a schismatican outcast all the changes consequent upon this grouped themselves around that one great blighting fact
she looked out upon the darkgrey lines of the church towers square and straight in the centre of the view cutting against the deep blue transparent depths beyond into which she gazed and felt that she might gaze for ever seeing at every moment some farther distance and yet no sign of god
it seemed to her at the moment as if the earth was more utterly desolate than if girt in by an iron dome behind which there might be the ineffaceable peace and glory of the almighty those neverending depths of space in their still serenity were more mocking to her than any material bounds could beshutting in the cries of earths sufferers which now might ascend into that infinite splendour of vastness and be lostlost for ever before they reached his throne
in this mood her father came in unheard
the moonlight was strong enough to let him see his daughter in her unusual place and attitude
he came to her and touched her shoulder before she was aware that he was there
margaret i heard you were up
i could not help coming in to ask you to pray with meto say the lords prayer that will do good to both of us  mr hale and margaret knelt by the windowseathe looking up she bowed down in humble shame
god was there close around them hearing her fathers whispered words
her father might be a heretic but had not she in her despairing doubts not five minutes before shown herself a far more utter sceptic
she spoke not a word but stole to bed after her father had left her like a child ashamed of its fault
if the world was full of perplexing problems she would trust and only ask to see the one step needful for the hour
mr lennoxhis visit his proposalthe remembrance of which had been so rudely pushed aside by the subsequent events of the dayhaunted her dreams that night
he was climbing up some tree of fabulous height to reach the branch whereon was slung her bonnet he was falling and she was struggling to save him but held back by some invisible powerful hand
he was dead
and yet with a shifting of the scene she was once more in the harley street drawingroom talking to him as of old and still with a consciousness all the time that she had seen him killed by that terrible fall
miserable unresting night
ill preparation for the coming day
she awoke with a start unrefreshed and conscious of some reality worse even than her feverish dreams
it all came back upon her not merely the sorrow but the terrible discord in the sorrow
where to what distance apart had her father wandered led by doubts which were to her temptations of the evil one
she longed to ask and yet would not have heard for all the world
the fine crisp morning made her mother feel particularly well and happy at breakfasttime
she talked on planning village kindness unheeding the silence of her husband and the monosyllabic answers of margaret
before the things were cleared away mr hale got up he leaned one hand on the table as if to support himself  i shall not be home till evening
i am going to bracy common and will ask farmer dobson to give me something for dinner
i shall be back to tea at seven  he did not look at either of them but margaret knew what he meant
by seven the announcement must be made to her mother
mr hale would have delayed making it but margaret was of different stuff
she could not bear the impending weight on her mind all day long better get the worst over the day would be too short to comfort her mother
but while she stood by the window thinking how to begin and waiting for the servant to have left the room her mother had gone up stairs to put on her things to go to the school
she came down ready equipped in a brisker mood than usual
mother come round the garden with me this morning just one turn said margaret putting her arm round mrs hales waist
they passed through the open window
mrs hale spokesaid somethingmargaret could not tell what
her eye caught on a bee entering a deepbelled flower when that bee flew forth with his spoil she would beginthat should be the sign
out he came
mamma
papa is going to leave helstone she blurted forth
hes going to leave the church and live in miltonnorthern there were the three hard facts hardly spoken
what makes you say so asked mrs hale in a surprised incredulous voice
who has been telling you such nonsense  papa himself said margaret longing to say something gentle and consoling but literally not knowing how
they were close to a gardenbench
mrs hale sat down and began to cry
i dont understand you she said
either you have made some great mistake or i dont quite understand you  no mother i have made no mistake
papa has written to the bishop saying that he has such doubts that he cannot conscientiously remain a priest of the church of england and that he must give up helstone
he has also consulted mr bellfredericks godfather you know mamma and it is arranged that we go to live at miltonnorthern mrs hale looked up in margarets face all the time she was speaking these words the shadow on her countenance told that she at least believed in the truth of what she said
i dont think it can be true said mrs hale at length
he would surely have told me before it came to this  it came strongly upon margarets mind that her mother ought to have been told that whatever her faults of discontent and repining might have been it was an error in her father to have left her to learn his change of opinion and his approaching change of life from her betterinformed child
margaret sat down by her mother and took her unresisting head on her breast bending her own soft cheeks down caressingly to touch her face
dear darling mamma
we were so afraid of giving you pain
papa felt so acutelyyou know you are not strong and there must have been such terrible suspense to go through  when did he tell you margaret  yesterday only yesterday replied margaret detecting the jealousy which prompted the inquiry
poor papatrying to divert her mothers thoughts into compassionate sympathy for all her father had gone through
mrs hale raised her head
what does he mean by having doubts she asked
surely he does not mean that he thinks differentlythat he knows better than the church  margaret shook her head and the tears came into her eyes as her mother touched the bare nerve of her own regret
cant the bishop set him right asked mrs hale half impatiently
im afraid not said margaret
but i did not ask
i could not bear to hear what he might answer
it is all settled at any rate
he is going to leave helstone in a fortnight
i am not sure if he did not say he had sent in his deed of resignation  in a fortnight exclaimed mrs hale i do think this is very strangenot at all right
i call it very unfeeling said she beginning to take relief in tears
he has doubts you say and gives up his living and all without consulting me
i dare say if he had told me his doubts at the first i could have nipped them in the bud  mistaken as margaret felt her fathers conduct to have been she could not bear to hear it blamed by her mother
she knew that his very reserve had originated in a tenderness for her which might be cowardly but was not unfeeling
i almost hoped you might be glad to leave helstone mamma said she after a pause
you have never been well in this air you know  you cant think the smoky air of a manufacturing town all chimneys and dirt like miltonnorthern would be better than this air which is pure and sweet if it is too soft and relaxing
fancy living in the middle of factories and factory people
though of course if your father leaves the church we shall not be admitted into society anywhere
it will be such a disgrace to us
poor dear sir john
it is well he is not alive to see what your father has come to
every day after dinner when i was a girl living with your aunt shaw at beresford court sir john used to give for the first toastchurch and king and down with the rump  margaret was glad that her mothers thoughts were turned away from the fact of her husbands silence to her on the point which must have been so near his heart
next to the serious vital anxiety as to the nature of her fathers doubts this was the one circumstance of the case that gave margaret the most pain
you know we have very little society here mamma
the gormans who are our nearest neighbours to call societyand we hardly ever see them have been in trade just as much as these miltonnorthern people  yes says mrs hale almost indignantly but at any rate the gormans made carriages for half the gentlemen of the county and were brought into some kind of intercourse with them but these factory people who on earth wears cotton that can afford linen  well mamma i give up the cottonspinners i am not standing up for them any more than for any other tradespeople
only we shall have little enough to do with them  why on earth has your father fixed on miltonnorthern to live in  partly said margaret sighing because it is so very different from helstonepartly because mr bell says there is an opening there for a private tutor  private tutor in milton
why cant he go to oxford and be a tutor to gentlemen  you forget mamma
he is leaving the church on account of his opinionshis doubts would do him no good at oxford  mrs hale was silent for some time quietly crying
at last she said  and the furniturehow in the world are we to manage the removal
i never removed in my life and only a fortnight to think about it  margaret was inexpressibly relieved to find that her mothers anxiety and distress was lowered to this point so insignificant to herself and on which she could do so much to help
she planned and promised and led her mother on to arrange fully as much as could be fixed before they knew somewhat more definitely what mr hale intended to do
throughout the day margaret never left her mother bending her whole soul to sympathise in all the various turns her feelings took towards evening especially as she became more and more anxious that her father should find a soothing welcome home awaiting him after his return from his day of fatigue and distress
she dwelt upon what he must have borne in secret for long her mother only replied coldly that he ought to have told her and that then at any rate he would have had an adviser to give him counsel and margaret turned faint at heart when she heard her fathers step in the hall
she dared not go to meet him and tell him what she had done all day for fear of her mothers jealous annoyance
she heard him linger as if awaiting her or some sign of her and she dared not stir she saw by her mothers twitching lips and changing colour that she too was aware that her husband had returned
presently he opened the roomdoor and stood there uncertain whether to come in
his face was gray and pale he had a timid fearful look in his eyes something almost pitiful to see in a mans face but that look of despondent uncertainty of mental and bodily languor touched his wifes heart
she went to him and threw herself on his breast crying out  oh
richard richard you should have told me sooner  and then in tears margaret left her as she rushed up stairs to throw herself on her bed and hide her face in the pillows to stifle the hysteric sobs that would force their way out at last after the rigid selfcontrol of the whole day
how long she lay thus she could not tell
she heard no noise though the housemaid came in to arrange the room
the affrighted girl stole out again on tiptoe and went and told mrs dixon that miss hale was crying as if her heart would break she was sure she would make herself deadly ill if she went on at that rate
in consequence of this margaret felt herself touched and started up into a sitting posture she saw the accustomed room the figure of dixon in shadow as the latter stood holding a candle a little behind her for fear of the effect on miss hales startled eyes swollen and blinded as they were
oh dixon
i did not hear you come into the room said margaret resuming her trembling selfrestraint
is it very late continued she lifting herself languidly off the bed yet letting her feet touch the ground without fairly standing down as she shaded her wet ruffled hair off her face and tried to look as though nothing were the matter as if she had been asleep
i can hardly tell what time it is replied dixon in an aggrieved tone of voice
since your mamma told me this terrible news when i dressed her for tea ive lost all count of time
im sure i dont know what is to become of us all
when charlotte told me just now you were sobbing miss hale i thought no wonder poor thing
and master thinking of turning dissenter at his time of life when if it is not to be said hes done well in the church hes not done badly after all
i had a cousin miss who turned methodist preacher after he was fifty years of age and a tailor all his life but then he had never been able to make a pair of trousers to fit for as long as he had been in the trade so it was no wonder but for master
as i said to missus what would poor sir john have said
he never liked your marrying mr hale but if he could have known it would have come to this he would have sworn worse oaths than ever if that was possible  dixon had been so much accustomed to comment upon mr hales proceedings to her mistress who listened to her or not as she was in the humour that she never noticed margarets flashing eye and dilating nostril
to hear her father talked of in this way by a servant to her face
dixon she said in the low tone she always used when much excited which had a sound in it as of some distant turmoil or threatening storm breaking far away
dixon
you forget to whom you are speaking she stood upright and firm on her feet now confronting the waitingmaid and fixing her with her steady discerning eye
i am mr hales daughter
go
you have made a strange mistake and one that i am sure your own good feeling will make you sorry for when you think about it  dixon hung irresolutely about the room for a minute or two
margaret repeated you may leave me dixon
i wish you to go dixon did not know whether to resent these decided words or to cry either course would have suited her mistress but as she said to herself miss margaret has a touch of the old gentleman about her as well as poor master frederick i wonder where they get it from and she who would have resented such words from any one less haughty and determined in manner was subdued enough to say in a half humble half injured tone  maynt i unfasten your gown miss and do your hair  no
not tonight thank you and margaret gravely lighted her out of the room and bolted the door
from henceforth dixon obeyed and admired margaret
she said it was because she was so like poor master frederick but the truth was that dixon as do many others liked to feel herself ruled by a powerful and decided nature
margaret needed all dixons help in action and silence in words for for some time the latter thought it her duty to show her sense of affront by saying as little as possible to her young lady so the energy came out in doing rather than in speaking
a fortnight was a very short time to make arrangements for so serious a removal as dixon said anyone but a gentlemanindeed almost any other gentleman but catching a look at margarets straight stern brow just here she coughed the remainder of the sentence away and meekly took the horehound drop that margaret offered her to stop the little tickling at my chest miss but almost any one but mr hale would have had practical knowledge enough to see that in so short a time it would be difficult to fix on any house in miltonnorthern or indeed elsewhere to which they could remove the furniture that had of necessity been taken out of helstone vicarage
mrs hale overpowered by all the troubles and necessities for immediate household decisions that seemed to come upon her at once became really ill and margaret almost felt it as a relief when her mother fairly took to her bed and left the management of affairs to her
dixon true to her post of bodyguard attended most faithfully to her mistress and only emerged from mrs hales bedroom to shake her head and murmur to herself in a manner which margaret did not choose to hear
for the one thing clear and straight before her was the necessity for leaving helstone
mr hales successor in the living was appointed and at any rate after her fathers decision there must be no lingering now for his sake as well as from every other consideration
for he came home every evening more and more depressed after the necessary leavetaking which he had resolved to have with every individual parishioner
margaret inexperienced as she was in all the necessary matteroffact business to be got through did not know to whom to apply for advice
the cook and charlotte worked away with willing arms and stout hearts at all the moving and packing and as far as that went margarets admirable sense enabled her to see what was best and to direct how it should be done
but where were they to go to
in a week they must be gone
straight to milton or where
so many arrangements depended on this precision that margaret resolved to ask her father one evening in spite of his evident fatigue and low spirits
he answered  my dear
i have really had too much to think about to settle this
what does your mother say
what does she wish
poor maria  he met with an echo even louder than his sigh
dixon had just come into the room for another cup of tea for mrs hale and catching mr hales last words and protected by his presence from margarets upbraiding eyes made bold to say my poor mistress  you dont think her worse today said mr hale turning hastily
i am sure i cant say sir
its not for me to judge
the illness seems so much more on the mind than on the body  mr hale looked infinitely distressed
you had better take mamma her tea while it is hot dixon said margaret in a tone of quiet authority
oh
i beg your pardon miss
my thoughts was otherwise occupied in thinking of my poor of mrs hale  papa said margaret it is this suspense that is bad for you both
of course mamma must feel your change of opinions we cant help that she continued softly but now the course is clear at least to a certain point
and i think papa that i could get mamma to help me in planning if you could tell me what to plan for
she has never expressed any wish in any way and only thinks of what cant be helped
are we to go straight to milton
have you taken a house there  no he replied i suppose we must go into lodgings and look about for a house  and pack up the furniture so that it can be left at the railway station till we have met with one  i suppose so
do what you think best
only remember we shall have much less money to spend  they had never had much superfluity as margaret knew
she felt that it was a great weight suddenly thrown upon her shoulders
four months ago all the decisions she needed to make were what dress she would wear for dinner and to help edith to draw out the lists of who should take down whom in the dinner parties at home
nor was the household in which she lived one that called for much decision
except in the one grand case of captain lennoxs offer everything went on with the regularity of clockwork
once a year there was a long discussion between her aunt and edith as to whether they should go to the isle of wight abroad or to scotland but at such times margaret herself was secure of drifting without any exertion of her own into the quiet harbour of home
now since that day when mr lennox came and startled her into a decision every day brought some question momentous to her and to those whom she loved to be settled
her father went up after tea to sit with his wife
margaret remained alone in the drawingroom
suddenly she took a candle and went into her fathers study for a great atlas and lugging it back into the drawingroom she began to pore over the map of england
she was ready to look up brightly when her father came down stairs
i have hit upon such a beautiful plan
look herein darkshire hardly the breadth of my finger from milton is heston which i have often heard of from people living in the north as such a pleasant little bathingplace
now dont you think we could get mamma there with dixon while you and i go and look at houses and get one all ready for her in milton
she would get a breath of sea air to set her up for the winter and be spared all the fatigue and dixon would enjoy taking care of her  is dixon to go with us asked mr hale in a kind of helpless dismay
oh yes said margaret
dixon quite intends it and i dont know what mamma would do without her  but we shall have to put up with a very different way of living i am afraid
everything is so much dearer in a town
i doubt if dixon can make herself comfortable
to tell you the truth margaret i sometimes feel as if that woman gave herself airs  to be sure she does papa replied margaret and if she has to put up with a different style of living we shall have to put up with her airs which will be worse
but she really loves us all and would be miserable to leave us i am sureespecially in this change so for mammas sake and for the sake of her faithfulness i do think she must go  very well my dear
go on
i am resigned
how far is heston from milton
the breadth of one of your fingers does not give me a very clear idea of distance  well then i suppose it is thirty miles that is not much  not in distance but in
never mind
if you really think it will do your mother good let it be fixed so  this was a great step
now margaret could work and act and plan in good earnest
and now mrs hale could rouse herself from her languor and forget her real suffering in thinking of the pleasure and the delight of going to the seaside
her only regret was that mr hale could not be with her all the fortnight she was to be there as he had been for a whole fortnight once when they were engaged and she was staying with sir john and lady beresford at torquay
farewell
unwatchd the garden bough shall sway         the tender blossom flutter down         unloved that beech will gather brown     the maple burn itself away      unloved the sunflower shining fair         ray round with flames her disk of seed         and many a rosecarnation feed     with summer spice the humming air                                            till from the garden and the wild         a fresh association blow         and year by year the landscape grow     familiar to the strangers child      as year by year the labourer tills         his wonted glebe or lops the glades         and year by year our memory fades     from all the circle of the hills               tennyson
the last day came the house was full of packingcases which were being carted off at the front door to the nearest railway station
even the pretty lawn at the side of the house was made unsightly and untidy by the straw that had been wafted upon it through the open door and windows
the rooms had a strange echoing sound in themand the light came harshly and strongly in through the uncurtained windowsseeming already unfamiliar and strange
mrs hales dressingroom was left untouched to the last and there she and dixon were packing up clothes and interrupting each other every now and then to exclaim at and turn over with fond regard some forgotten treasure in the shape of some relic of the children while they were yet little
they did not make much progress with their work
downstairs margaret stood calm and collected ready to counsel or advise the men who had been called in to help the cook and charlotte
these two last crying between whiles wondered how the young lady could keep up so this last day and settled it between them that she was not likely to care much for helstone having been so long in london
there she stood very pale and quiet with her large grave eyes observing everythingup to every present circumstance however small
they could not understand how her heart was aching all the time with a heavy pressure that no sighs could lift off or relieve and how constant exertion for her perceptive faculties was the only way to keep herself from crying out with pain
moreover if she gave way who was to act
her father was examining papers books registers what not in the vestry with the clerk and when he came in there were his own books to pack up which no one but himself could do to his satisfaction
besides was margaret one to give way before strange men or even household friends like the cook and charlotte
not she
but at last the four packers went into the kitchen to their tea and margaret moved stiffly and slowly away from the place in the hall where she had been standing so long out through the bare echoing drawingroom into the twilight of an early november evening
there was a filmy veil of soft dull mist obscuring but not hiding all objects giving them a lilac hue for the sun had not yet fully set a robin was singingperhaps margaret thought the very robin that her father had so often talked of as his winter pet and for which he had made with his own hands a kind of robinhouse by his studywindow
the leaves were more gorgeous than ever the first touch of frost would lay them all low on the ground
already one or two kept constantly floating down amber and golden in the low slanting sunrays
margaret went along the walk under the peartree wall
she had never been along it since she paced it at henry lennoxs side
here at this bed of thyme he began to speak of what she must not think of now
her eyes were on that lateblowing rose as she was trying to answer and she had caught the idea of the vivid beauty of the feathery leaves of the carrots in the very middle of his last sentence
only a fortnight ago
and all so changed
where was he now
in londongoing through the old round dining with the old harley street set or with gayer young friends of his own
even now while she walked sadly through that damp and drear garden in the dusk with everything falling and fading and turning to decay around her he might be gladly putting away his lawbooks after a day of satisfactory toil and freshening himself up as he had told her he often did by a run in the temple gardens taking in the while the grand inarticulate mighty roar of tens of thousands of busy men nigh at hand but not seen and catching ever at his quick turns glimpses of the lights of the city coming up out of the depths of the river
he had often spoken to margaret of these hasty walks snatched in the intervals between study and dinner
at his best times and in his best moods had he spoken of them and the thought of them had struck upon her fancy
here there was no sound
the robin had gone away into the vast stillness of night
now and then a cottage door in the distance was opened and shut as if to admit the tired labourer to his home but that sounded very far away
a stealthy creeping cranching sound among the crisp fallen leaves of the forest beyond the garden seemed almost close at hand
margaret knew it was some poacher
sitting up in her bedroom this past autumn with the light of her candle extinguished and purely revelling in the solemn beauty of the heavens and the earth she had many a time seen the light noiseless leap of the poachers over the gardenfence their quick tramp across the dewy moonlit lawn their disappearance in the black still shadow beyond
the wild adventurous freedom of their life had taken her fancy she felt inclined to wish them success she had no fear of them
but tonight she was afraid she knew not why
she heard charlotte shutting the windows and fastening up for the night unconscious that any one had gone out into the garden
a small branchit might be of rotten wood or it might be broken by forcecame heavily down in the nearest part of the forest margaret ran swift as camilla down to the window and rapped at it with a hurried tremulousness which startled charlotte within
let me in
let me in
it is only me charlotte her heart did not still its fluttering till she was safe in the drawingroom with the windows fastened and bolted and the familiar walls hemming her round and shutting her in
she had sate down upon a packingcase cheerless chill was the dreary and dismantled roomno fire nor other light but charlottes long unsnuffed candle
charlotte looked at margaret with surprise and margaret feeling it rather than seeing it rose up
i was afraid you were shutting me out altogether charlotte said she halfsmiling
and then you would never have heard me in the kitchen and the doors into the lane and churchyard are locked long ago  oh miss i should have been sure to have missed you soon
the men would have wanted you to tell them how to go on
and i have put tea in masters study as being the most comfortable room so to speak  thank you charlotte
you are a kind girl
i shall be sorry to leave you
you must try and write to me if i can ever give you any little help or good advice
i shall always be glad to get a letter from helstone you know
i shall be sure and send you my address when i know it  the study was all ready for tea
there was a good blazing fire and unlighted candles on the table
margaret sat down on the rug partly to warm herself for the dampness of the evening hung about her dress and overfatigue had made her chilly
she kept herself balanced by clasping her hands together round her knees her head dropped a little towards her chest the attitude was one of despondency whatever her frame of mind might be
but when she heard her fathers step on the gravel outside she started up and hastily shaking her heavy black hair back and wiping a few tears away that had come on her cheeks she knew not how she went out to open the door for him
he showed far more depression than she did
she could hardly get him to talk although she tried to speak on subjects that would interest him at the cost of an effort every time which she thought would be her last
have you been a very long walk today asked she on seeing his refusal to touch food of any kind
as far as fordham beeches
i went to see widow maltby she is sadly grieved at not having wished you goodbye
she says little susan has kept watch down the lane for days pastnay margaret what is the matter dear the thought of the little child watching for her and continually disappointedfrom no forgetfulness on her part but from sheer inability to leave homewas the last drop in poor margarets cup and she was sobbing away as if her heart would break
mr hale was distressingly perplexed
he rose and walked nervously up and down the room
margaret tried to check herself but would not speak until she could do so with firmness
she heard him talking as if to himself
i cannot bear it
i cannot bear to see the sufferings of others
i think i could go through my own with patience
oh is there no going back  no father said margaret looking straight at him and speaking low and steadily
it is bad to believe you in error
it would be infinitely worse to have known you a hypocrite she dropped her voice at the last few words as if entertaining the idea of hypocrisy for a moment in connection with her father savoured of irreverence
besides she went on it is only that i am tired tonight dont think that i am suffering from what you have done dear papa
we cant either of us talk about it tonight i believe said she finding that tears and sobs would come in spite of herself
i had better go and take mamma up this cup of tea
she had hers very early when i was too busy to go to her and i am sure she will be glad of another now  railroad time inexorably wrenched them away from lovely beloved helstone the next morning
they were gone they had seen the last of the long low parsonage home halfcovered with chinaroses and pyracanthusmore homelike than ever in the morning sun that glittered on its windows each belonging to some wellloved room
almost before they had settled themselves into the car sent from southampton to fetch them to the station they were gone away to return no more
a sting at margarets heart made her strive to look out to catch the last glimpse of the old church tower at the turn where she knew it might be seen above a wave of the forest trees but her father remembered this too and she silently acknowledged his greater right to the one window from which it could be seen
she leant back and shut her eyes and the tears welled forth and hung glittering for an instant on the shadowing eyelashes before rolling slowly down her cheeks and dropping unheeded on her dress
they were to stop in london all night at some quiet hotel
poor mrs hale had cried in her way nearly all day long and dixon showed her sorrow by extreme crossness and a continual irritable attempt to keep her petticoats from even touching the unconscious mr hale whom she regarded as the origin of all this suffering
they went through the wellknown streets past houses which they had often visited past shops in which she had lounged impatient by her aunts side while that lady was making some important and interminable decisionnay absolutely passed acquaintances in the streets for though the morning had been of an incalculable length to them and they felt as if it ought long ago to have closed in for the repose of darkness it was the very busiest time of a london afternoon in november when they arrived there
it was long since mrs hale had been in london and she roused up almost like a child to look about her at the different streets and to gaze after and exclaim at the shops and carriages  oh theres harrisons where i bought so many of my wedding things
dear
how altered
theyve got immense plateglass windows larger than crawfords in southampton
oh and there i declareno it is notyes it ismargaret we have just passed mr henry lennox
where can he be going among all these shops  margaret started forwards and as quickly fell back halfsmiling at herself for the sudden motion
they were a hundred yards away by this time but he seemed like a relic of helstonehe was associated with a bright morning an eventful day and she should have liked to have seen him without his seeing herwithout the chance of their speaking
the evening without employment passed in a room high up in an hotel was long and heavy
mr hale went out to his booksellers and to call on a friend or two
every one they saw either in the house or out in the streets appeared hurrying to some appointment expected by or expecting somebody
they alone seemed strange and friendless and desolate
yet within a mile margaret knew of house after house where she for her own sake and her mother for her aunt shaws would be welcomed if they came in gladness or even in peace of mind
if they came sorrowing and wanting sympathy in a complicated trouble like the present then they would be felt as a shadow in all these houses of intimate acquaintances not friends
london life is too whirling and full to admit of even an hour of that deep silence of feeling which the friends of job showed when they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great      new scenes and faces
mist clogs the sunshine         smoky dwarf houses     have we round on every side                      matthew arnold
the next afternoon about twenty miles from miltonnorthern they entered on the little branch railway that led to heston
heston itself was one long straggling street running parallel to the seashore
it had a character of its own as different from the little bathingplaces in the south of england as they again from those of the continent
to use a scotch word everything looked more purposelike the country carts had more iron and less wood and leather about the horsegear the people in the streets although on pleasure bent had yet a busy mind
the colours looked grayermore enduring not so gay and pretty
there were no smockfrocks even among the countryfolk they retarded motion and were apt to catch on machinery and so the habit of wearing them had died out
in such towns in the south of england margaret had seen the shopmen when not employed in their business lounging a little at their doors enjoying the fresh air and the look up and down the street
here if they had any leisure from customers they made themselves business in the shopeven margaret fancied to the unnecessary unrolling and rerolling of ribbons
all these differences struck upon her mind as she and her mother went out next morning to look for lodgings
their two nights at hotels had cost more than mr hale had anticipated and they were glad to take the first clean cheerful rooms they met with that were at liberty to receive them
there for the first time for many days did margaret feel at rest
there was a dreaminess in the rest too which made it still more perfect and luxurious to repose in
the distant sea lapped the sandy shore with measured sound the nearer cries of the donkeyboys the unusual scenes moving before her like pictures which she cared not in her laziness to have fully explained before they passed away the stroll down to the beach to breathe the seaair soft and warm on that sandy shore even to the end of november the great long misty sealine touching the tendercoloured sky the white sail of a distant boat turning silver in some pale sunbeamit seemed as if she could dream her life away in such luxury of pensiveness in which she made her present all in all from not daring to think of the past or wishing to contemplate the future
but the future must be met however stern and iron it be
one evening it was arranged that margaret and her father should go the next day to miltonnorthern and look out for a house
mr hale had received several letters from mr bell and one or two from mr thornton and he was anxious to ascertain at once a good many particulars respecting his position and chances of success there which he could only do by an interview with the latter gentleman
margaret knew that they ought to be removing but she had a repugnance to the idea of a manufacturing town and believed that her mother was receiving benefit from heston air so she would willingly have deferred the expedition to milton
for several miles before they reached milton they saw a deep leadcoloured cloud hanging over the horizon in the direction in which it lay
it was all the darker from contrast with the pale grayblue of the wintry sky for in heston there had been the earliest signs of frost
nearer to the town the air had a faint taste and smell of smoke perhaps after all more a loss of the fragrance of grass and herbage than any positive taste or smell
quick they were whirled over long straight hopeless streets of regularlybuilt houses all small and of brick
here and there a great oblong manywindowed factory stood up like a hen among her chickens puffing out black unparliamentary smoke and sufficiently accounting for the cloud which margaret had taken to foretell rain
as they drove through the larger and wider streets from the station to the hotel they had to stop constantly great loaded lurries blocked up the not overwide thoroughfares
margaret had now and then been into the city in her drives with her aunt
but there the heavy lumbering vehicles seemed various in their purposes and intent here every van every waggon and truck bore cotton either in the raw shape in bags or the woven shape in bales of calico
people thronged the footpaths most of them welldressed as regarded the material but with a slovenly looseness which struck margaret as different from the shabby threadbare smartness of a similar class in london
new street said mr hale
this i believe is the principal street in milton
bell has often spoken to me about it
it was the opening of this street from a lane into a great thoroughfare thirty years ago which has caused his property to rise so much in value
mr thorntons mill must be somewhere not very far off for he is mr bells tenant
but i fancy he dates from his warehouse  where is our hotel papa  close to the end of this street i believe
shall we have lunch before or after we have looked at the houses we marked in the milton times  oh let us get our work done first  very well
then i will only see if there is any note or letter for me from mr thornton who said he would let me know anything he might hear about these houses and then we will set off
we will keep the cab it will be safer than losing ourselves and being too late for the train this afternoon  there were no letters awaiting him
they set out on their househunting
thirty pounds ayear was all they could afford to give but in hampshire they could have met with a roomy house and pleasant garden for the money
here even the necessary accommodation of two sittingrooms and four bedrooms seemed unattainable
they went through their list rejecting each as they visited it
they then looked at each other in dismay
we must go back to the second i think
that onein crampton dont they call the suburb
there were three sittingrooms dont you remember how we laughed at the number compared with the three bedrooms
but i have planned it all
the front room downstairs is to be your study and our diningroom poor papa
 for you know we settled mamma is to have as cheerful a sittingroom as we can get and that front room upstairs with the atrocious blue and pink paper and heavy cornice had really a pretty view over the plain with a great bend of river or canal or whatever it is down below
then i could have the little bedroom behind in that projection at the head of the first flight of stairs over the kitchen you knowand you and mamma the room behind the drawingroom and that closet in the roof will make you a splendid dressingroom  but dixon and the girl we are to have to help  oh wait a minute
i am overpowered by the discovery of my own genius for management
dixon is to havelet me see i had it oncethe back sittingroom
i think she will like that
she grumbles so much about the stairs at heston and the girl is to have that sloping attic over your room and mammas
wont that do  i dare say it will
but the papers
what taste
and the overloading such a house with colour and such heavy cornices  never mind papa
surely you can charm the landlord into repapering one or two of the roomsthe drawingroom and your bedroomfor mamma will come most in contact with them and your bookshelves will hide a great deal of that gaudy pattern in the diningroom  then you think it the best
if so i had better go at once and call on this mr donkin to whom the advertisement refers me
i will take you back to the hotel where you can order lunch and rest and by the time it is ready i shall be with you
i hope i shall be able to get new papers  margaret hoped so too though she said nothing
she had never come fairly in contact with the taste that loves ornament however bad more than the plainness and simplicity which are of themselves the framework of elegance
her father took her through the entrance of the hotel and leaving her at the foot of the staircase went to the address of the landlord of the house they had fixed upon
just as margaret had her hand on the door of their sittingroom she was followed by a quickstepping waiter  i beg your pardon maam
the gentleman was gone so quickly i had no time to tell him
mr thornton called almost directly after you left and as i understood from what the gentleman said you would be back in an hour i told him so and he came again about five minutes ago and said he would wait for mr hale
he is in your room now maam  thank you
my father will return soon and then you can tell him  margaret opened the door and went in with the straight fearless dignified presence habitual to her
she felt no awkwardness she had too much the habits of society for that
here was a person come on business to her father and as he was one who had shown himself obliging she was disposed to treat him with a full measure of civility
mr thornton was a good deal more surprised and discomfited than she
instead of a quiet middleaged clergyman a young lady came forward with frank dignitya young lady of a different type to most of those he was in the habit of seeing
her dress was very plain a close straw bonnet of the best material and shape trimmed with white ribbon a large indian shawl which hung about her in long heavy folds and which she wore as an empress wears her drapery
he did not understand who she was as he caught the simple straight unabashed look which showed that his being there was of no concern to the beautiful countenance and called up no flush of surprise to the pale ivory of the complexion
he had heard that mr hale had a daughter but he had imagined that she was a little girl
mr
thornton i believe said margaret after a halfinstants pause during which his unready words would not come
will you sit down
my father brought me to the door not a minute ago but unfortunately he was not told that you were here and he has gone away on some business
but he will come back almost directly
i am sorry you have had the trouble of calling twice  mr thornton was in habits of authority himself but she seemed to assume some kind of rule over him at once
he had been getting impatient at the loss of his time on a marketday the moment before she appeared yet now he calmly took a seat at her bidding
do you know where it is that mr hale has gone to
perhaps i might be able to find him  he has gone to a mr donkin in canute street
he is the landlord of the house my father wishes to take in crampton  mr thornton knew the house
he had seen the advertisement and been to look at it in compliance with a request of mr bells that he would assist mr hale to the best of his power and also instigated by his own interest in the case of a clergyman who had given up his living under circumstances such as those of mr hale
mr thornton had thought that the house in crampton was really just the thing but now that he saw margaret with her superb ways of moving and looking he began to feel ashamed of having imagined that it would do very well for the hales in spite of a certain vulgarity in it which had struck him at the time of his looking it over
margaret could not help her looks but the short curled upper lip the round massive upturned chin the manner of carrying her head her movements full of a soft feminine defiance always gave strangers the impression of haughtiness
she was tired now and would much rather have remained silent and taken the rest her father had planned for her but of course she owed to herself to be a gentlewoman and to speak courteously from time to time to this stranger not overbrushed nor overpolished it must be confessed after his rough encounter with milton streets and crowds
she wished that he would go as he had once spoken of doing instead of sitting there answering with curt sentences all the remarks she made
she had taken off her shawl and hung it over the back of her chair
she sat facing him and facing the light her full beauty met his eye her round white flexile throat rising out of the full yet lithe figure her lips moving so slightly as she spoke not breaking the cold serene look of her face with any variation from the one lovely haughty curve her eyes with their soft gloom meeting his with quiet maiden freedom
he almost said to himself that he did not like her before their conversation ended he tried so to compensate himself for the mortified feeling that while he looked upon her with an admiration he could not repress she looked at him with proud indifference taking him he thought for what in his irritation he told himself he wasa great rough fellow with not a grace or a refinement about him
her quiet coldness of demeanour he interpreted into contemptuousness and resented it in his heart to the pitch of almost inclining him to get up and go away and have nothing more to do with these hales and their superciliousness
just as margaret had exhausted her last subject of conversationand yet conversation that could hardly be called which consisted of so few and such short speechesher father came in and with his pleasant gentlemanly courteousness of apology reinstated his name and family in mr thorntons good opinion
mr hale and his visitor had a good deal to say respecting their mutual friend mr bell and margaret glad that her part of entertaining the visitor was over went to the window to try and make herself more familiar with the strange aspect of the street
she got so much absorbed in watching what was going on outside that she hardly heard her father when he spoke to her and he had to repeat what he said  margaret
the landlord will persist in admiring that hideous paper and i am afraid we must let it remain  oh dear
i am sorry she replied and began to turn over in her mind the possibility of hiding part of it at least by some of her sketches but gave up the idea at last as likely only to make bad worse
her father meanwhile with his kindly country hospitality was pressing mr thornton to stay to luncheon with them
it would have been very inconvenient to him to do so yet he felt that he should have yielded if margaret by word or look had seconded her fathers invitation he was glad she did not and yet he was irritated at her for not doing so
she gave him a low grave bow when he left and he felt more awkward and selfconscious in every limb than he had ever done in his life before
well margaret now to luncheon as fast as we can
have you ordered it  no papa that man was here when i came home and i have never had an opportunity  then we must take anything we can get
he must have been waiting a long time im afraid  it seemed exceedingly long to me
i was just at the last gasp when you came in
he never went on with any subject but gave little short abrupt answers  very much to the point though i should think
he is a clearheaded fellow
he said did you hear
that crampton is on gravelly soil and by far the most healthy suburb in the neighbourhood of milton  when they returned to heston there was the days account to be given to mrs hale who was full of questions which they answered in the intervals of teadrinking
and what is your correspondent mr thornton like  ask margaret said her husband
she and he had a long attempt at conversation while i was away speaking to the landlord  oh
i hardly know what he is like said margaret lazily too tired to tax her powers of description much
and then rousing herself she said he is a tall broadshouldered man abouthow old papa  i should guess about thirty  about thirtywith a face that is neither exactly plain nor yet handsome nothing remarkablenot quite a gentleman but that was hardly to be expected  not vulgar or common though put in her father rather jealous of any disparagement of the sole friend he had in milton
oh no said margaret
with such an expression of resolution and power no face however plain in feature could be either vulgar or common
i should not like to have to bargain with him he looks very inflexible
altogether a man who seems made for his niche mamma sagacious and strong as becomes a great tradesman  dont call the milton manufacturers tradesmen margaret said her father
they are very different  are they
i apply the word to all who have something tangible to sell but if you think the term is not correct papa i wont use it
but oh mamma
speaking of vulgarity and commonness you must prepare yourself for our drawingroom paper
pink and blue roses with yellow leaves
and such a heavy cornice round the room  but when they removed to their new house in milton the obnoxious papers were gone
the landlord received their thanks very composedly and let them think if they liked that he had relented from his expressed determination not to repaper
there was no particular need to tell them that what he did not care to do for a reverend mr hale unknown in milton he was only too glad to do at the one short sharp remonstrance of mr thornton the wealthy manufacturer
home sickness
and its hame hame hame     hame fain wad i be   it needed the pretty light papering of the rooms to reconcile them to milton
it needed moremore that could not be had
the thick yellow november fogs had come on and the view of the plain in the valley made by the sweeping bend of the river was all shut out when mrs hale arrived at her new home
margaret and dixon had been at work two days unpacking and arranging but everything inside the house still looked in disorder and outside a thick fog crept up to the very windows and was driven in to every open door in choking white wreaths of unwholsome mist
oh margaret
are we to live here asked mrs hale in blank dismay
margarets heart echoed the dreariness of the tone in which this question was put
she could scarcely command herself enough to say oh the fogs in london are sometimes far worse  but then you knew that london itself and friends lay behind it
herewell
we are desolate
oh dixon what a place this is  indeed maam im sure it will be your death before long and then i know whollstay
miss hale thats far too heavy for you to lift  not at all thank you dixon replied margaret coldly
the best thing we can do for mamma is to get her room quite ready for her to go to bed while i go and bring her a cup of coffee  mr hale was equally out of spirits and equally came upon margaret for sympathy
margaret i do believe this is an unhealthy place
only suppose that your mothers health or yours should suffer
i wish i had gone into some country place in wales this is really terrible said he going up to the window
there was no comfort to be given
they were settled in milton and must endure smoke and fogs for a season indeed all other life seemed shut out from them by as thick a fog of circumstance
only the day before mr hale had been reckoning up with dismay how much their removal and fortnight at heston had cost and he found it had absorbed nearly all his little stock of ready money
no
here they were and here they must remain
at night when margaret realised this she felt inclined to sit down in a stupor of despair
the heavy smoky air hung about her bedroom which occupied the long narrow projection at the back of the house
the window placed at the side of the oblong looked at the blank wall of a similar projection not above ten feet distant
it loomed through the fog like a great barrier to hope
inside the room everything was in confusion
all their efforts had been directed to make her mothers room comfortable
margaret sat down on a box the direction card upon which struck her as having been written at helstonebeautiful beloved helstone
she lost herself in dismal thought but at last she determined to take her mind away from the present and suddenly remembered that she had a letter from edith which she had only half read in the bustle of the morning
it was to tell of their arrival at corfu their voyage along the mediterraneantheir music and dancing on board ship the gay new life opening upon her her house with its trellised balcony and its views over white cliffs and deep blue sea
edith wrote fluently and well if not graphically
she could not only seize the salient and characteristic points of a scene but she could enumerate enough of indiscriminate particular for margaret to make it out for herself
captain lennox and another lately married officer shared a villa high up on the beautiful precipitous rocks overhanging the sea
their days late as it was in the year seemed spent in boating or landpicnics all outofdoors pleasureseeking and glad ediths life seemed like the deep vault of blue sky above her freeutterly free from fleck or cloud
her husband had to attend drill and she the most musical officers wife there had to copy the new and popular tunes out of the most recent english music for the benefit of the bandmaster those seemed their most severe and arduous duties
she expressed an affectionate hope that if the regiment stopped another year at corfu margaret might come out and pay her a long visit
she asked margaret if she remembered the day twelvemonth on which she edith wrotehow it rained all day long in harley street and how she would not put on her new gown to go to a stupid dinner and get it all wet and splashed in going to the carriage and how at that very dinner they had first met captain lennox
yes
margaret remembered it well
edith and mrs shaw had gone to dinner
margaret had joined the party in the evening
the recollection of the plentiful luxury of all arrangements the stately handsomeness of the furniture the size of the house the peaceful untroubled ease of the visitorsall came vividly before her in strange contrast to the present time
the smooth sea of that old life closed up without a mark left to tell where they had all been
the habitual dinners the calls the dancing evenings were all going on going on for ever though her aunt shaw and edith were no longer there and she of course was even less missed
she doubted if any one of that old set ever thought of her except henry lennox
he too she knew would strive to forget her because of the pain she had caused him
she had heard him often boast of his power of putting any disagreeable thought far away from him
then she penetrated farther into what might have been
if she had cared for him as a lover and had accepted him and this change in her fathers opinions and consequent station had taken place she could not doubt but that it would have been impatiently received by mr lennox
it was a bitter mortification to her in one sense but she could bear it patiently because she knew her fathers purity of purpose and that strengthened her to endure his errors grave and serious though in her estimation they were
but the fact of the world esteeming her father degraded in its rough wholesale judgment would have oppressed and irritated mr lennox
as she realised what might have been she grew to be thankful for what was
they were at the lowest now they could not be worse
ediths astonishment and her aunt shaws dismay would have to be met bravely when their letters came
so margaret rose up and began slowly to undress herself feeling the full luxury of acting leisurely late as it was after all the past hurry of the day
she fell asleep hoping for some brightness either internal or external
but if she had known how long it would be before the brightness came her heart would have sunk low down
the time of the year was most unpropitious to health as well as to spirits
her mother caught a severe cold and dixon herself was evidently not well although margaret could not insult her more than by trying to save her or by taking any care of her
they could hear of no girl to assist her all were at work in the factories at least those who applied were well scolded by dixon for thinking that such as they could ever be trusted to work in a gentlemans house
so they had to keep a charwoman in almost constant employ
margaret longed to send for charlotte but besides the objection of her being a better servant than they now could afford to keep the distance was too great
mr hale met with several pupils recommended to him by mr bell or by the more immediate influence of mr thornton
they were mostly of the age when many boys would be still at school but according to the prevalent and apparently wellfounded notions of milton to make a lad into a good tradesman he must be caught young and acclimated to the life of the mill or office or warehouse
if he were sent to even the scotch universities he came back unsettled for commercial pursuits how much more so if he went to oxford or cambridge where he could not be entered till he was eighteen
so most of the manufacturers placed their sons in situations at from fourteen or fifteen years of age unsparingly cutting away all offshoots in the direction of literature or high mental cultivation in hopes of throwing the whole strength and vigour of the plant into commerce
still there were some wiser parents and some who had sense enough to perceive their own deficiencies and strive to remedy them
nay there were a few no longer youths but men in the prime of life who had the stern wisdom to acknowledge their own ignorance and to learn late what they should have learnt early
mr thornton was perhaps the oldest of mr hales pupils
he was certainly the favourite
mr hale got into the habit of quoting his opinions so frequently and with such regard that it became a little domestic joke to wonder what time during the hour appointed for instruction could be given to absolute learning so much of it appeared to have been spent in conversation
margaret rather encouraged this light merry way of viewing her fathers acquaintance with mr thornton because she felt that her mother was inclined to look upon this new friendship of her husbands with jealous eyes
as long as his time had been solely occupied with his books and his parishioners as at helstone she had appeared to care little whether she saw much of him or not but now that he looked eagerly forward to each renewal of his intercourse with mr thornton she seemed hurt and annoyed as if he were slighting her companionship for the first time
mr hales overpraise had the usual effect of overpraise upon his auditors they were a little inclined to rebel against aristides being always called the just
after a quiet life in a country parsonage for more than twenty years there was something dazzling to mr hale in the energy which conquered immense difficulties with ease the power of the machinery of milton the power of the men of milton impressed him with a sense of grandeur which he yielded to without caring to inquire into the details of its exercise
but margaret went less abroad among machinery and men saw less of power in its public effect and as it happened she was thrown with one or two of those who in all measures affecting masses of people must be acute sufferers for the good of many
the question always is has everything been done to make the sufferings of these exceptions as small as possible
or in the triumph of the crowded procession have the helpless been trampled on instead of being gently lifted aside out of the roadway of the conqueror whom they have no power to accompany on his march
it fell to margarets share to have to look out for a servant to assist dixon who had at first undertaken to find just the person she wanted to do all the rough work of the house
but dixons ideas of helpful girls were founded on the recollection of tidy elder scholars at helstone school who were only too proud to be allowed to come to the parsonage on a busy day and treated mrs dixon with all the respect and a good deal more of fright which they paid to mr and mrs hale
dixon was not unconscious of this awed reverence which was given to her nor did she dislike it it flattered her much as louis the fourteenth was flattered by his courtiers shading their eyes from the dazzling light of his presence
but nothing short of her faithful love for mrs hale could have made her endure the rough independent way in which all the milton girls who made application for the servants place replied to her inquiries respecting their qualifications
they even went the length of questioning her back again having doubts and fears of their own as to the solvency of a family who lived in a house of thirty pounds ayear and yet gave themselves airs and kept two servants one of them so very high and mighty
mr hale was no longer looked upon as vicar of helstone but as a man who only spent at a certain rate
margaret was weary and impatient of the accounts which dixon perpetually brought to mrs hale of the behaviour of these wouldbe servants
not but what margaret was repelled by the rough uncourteous manners of these people not but what she shrunk with fastidious pride from their hailfellow accost and severely resented their unconcealed curiosity as to the means and position of any family who lived in milton and yet were not engaged in trade of some kind
but the more margaret felt impertinence the more likely she was to be silent on the subject and at any rate if she took upon herself to make inquiry for a servant she could spare her mother the recital of all her disappointments and fancied or real insults
margaret accordingly went up and down to butchers and grocers seeking for a nonpareil of a girl and lowering her hopes and expectations every week as she found the difficulty of meeting with any one in a manufacturing town who did not prefer the better wages and greater independence of working in a mill
it was something of a trial to margaret to go out by herself in this busy bustling place
mrs shaws ideas of propriety and her own helpless dependence on others had always made her insist that a footman should accompany edith and margaret if they went beyond harley street or the immediate neighbourhood
the limits by which this rule of her aunts had circumscribed margarets independence had been silently rebelled against at the time and she had doubly enjoyed the free walks and rambles of her forest life from the contrast which they presented
she went along there with a boundless fearless step that occasionally broke out into a run if she were in a hurry and occasionally was stilled into perfect repose as she stood listening to or watching any of the wild creatures who sang in the leafy courts or glanced out with their keen bright eyes from the low brushwood or tangled furze
it was a trial to come down from such motion or such stillness only guided by her own sweet will to the even and decorous pace necessary in streets
but she could have laughed at herself for minding this change if it had not been accompanied by what was a more serious annoyance
the side of the town on which crampton lay was especially a thoroughfare for the factory people
in the back streets around them there were many mills out of which poured streams of men and women two or three times a day
until margaret had learnt the times of their ingress and egress she was very unfortunate in constantly falling in with them
they came rushing along with bold fearless faces and loud laughs and jests particularly aimed at all those who appeared to be above them in rank or station
the tones of their unrestrained voices and their carelessness of all common rules of street politeness frightened margaret a little at first
the girls with their rough but not unfriendly freedom would comment on her dress even touch her shawl or gown to ascertain the exact material nay once or twice she was asked questions relative to some article which they particularly admired
there was such a simple reliance on her womanly sympathy with their love of dress and on her kindliness that she gladly replied to these inquiries as soon as she understood them and half smiled back at their remarks
she did not mind meeting any number of girls loud spoken and boisterous though they might be
but she alternately dreaded and fired up against the workmen who commented not on her dress but on her looks in the same open fearless manner
she who had hitherto felt that even the most refined remark on her personal appearance was an impertinence had to endure undisguised admiration from these outspoken men
but the very outspokenness marked their innocence of any intention to hurt her delicacy as she would have perceived if she had been less frightened by the disorderly tumult
out of her fright came a flash of indignation which made her face scarlet and her dark eyes gather flame as she heard some of their speeches
yet there were other sayings of theirs which when she reached the quiet safety of home amused her even while they irritated her
for instance one day after she had passed a number of men several of whom had paid her the not unusual compliment of wishing she was their sweetheart one of the lingerers added your bonny face my lass makes the day look brighter and another day as she was unconsciously smiling at some passing thought she was addressed by a poorlydressed middleaged workman with you may well smile my lass many a one would smile to have such a bonny face this man looked so careworn that margaret could not help giving him an answering smile glad to think that her looks such as they were should have had the power to call up a pleasant thought
he seemed to understand her acknowledging glance and a silent recognition was established between them whenever the chances of the day brought them across each others paths
they had never exchanged a word nothing had been said but that first compliment yet somehow margaret looked upon this man with more interest than upon any one else in milton
once or twice on sundays she saw him walking with a girl evidently his daughter and if possible still more unhealthy than he was himself
one day margaret and her father had been as far as the fields that lay around the town it was early spring and she had gathered some of the hedge and ditch flowers dogviolets lesser celandines and the like with an unspoken lament in her heart for the sweet profusion of the south
her father had left her to go into milton upon some business and on the road home she met her humble friends
the girl looked wistfully at the flowers and acting on a sudden impulse margaret offered them to her
her pale blue eyes lightened up as she took them and her father spoke for her
thank yo miss
bessyll think a deal o them flowers that hoo will and i shall think a deal o yor kindness
yore not of this country i reckon  no said margaret half sighing
i come from the southfrom hampshire she continued a little afraid of wounding his consciousness of ignorance if she used a name which he did not understand
thats beyond london i reckon
and i come fro burnleyways and forty miles to th north
and yet yo see north and south has both met and made kind o friends in this big smoky place  margaret had slackened her pace to a walk alongside of the man and his daughter whose steps were regulated by the feebleness of the latter
she now spoke to the girl and there was a sound of tender pity in the tone of her voice as she did so that went right to the heart of the father
im afraid you are not very strong  no said the girl nor never will be  spring is coming said margaret as if to suggest pleasant hopeful thoughts
spring nor summer will do me good said the girl quietly
margaret looked up at the man almost expecting some contradiction from him or at least some remark that would modify his daughters utter hopelessness
but instead he added  im afeared hoo speaks the truth
im afeared hoos too far gone in a waste  i shall have a spring where i am boun to and flowers and amaranths and shining robes besides  poor lass poor lass said her father in a low tone
im none so sure o that but its a comfort to thee poor lass poor lass
poor father
itll be soon  margaret was shocked by his wordsshocked but not repelled rather attracted and interested
where do you live
i think we must be neighbours we meet so often on this road  we put up at nine frances street second turn to th left at after yove past th goulden dragon  and your name
i must not forget that  im none ashamed o my name
its nicholas higgins
hoos called bessy higgins
whatten yo asking for  margaret was surprised at this last question for at helstone it would have been an understood thing after the enquiries she had made that she intended to come and call upon any poor neighbour whose name and habitation she had asked for
i thoughti meant to come and see you she suddenly felt rather shy of offering the visit without having any reason to give for her wish to make it beyond a kindly interest in a stranger
it seemed all at once to take the shape of an impertinence on her part she read this meaning too in the mans eyes
im none so fond of having strange folk in my house but then relenting as he saw her heightened colour he added yore a foreigner as one may say and maybe dont know many folk here and yove given my wench here flowers out of yor own handyo may come if yo like  margaret was half amused halfnettled at this answer
she was not sure if she would go where permission was given so like a favour conferred
but when they came to the turn into frances street the girl stopped a minute and said  yoll not forget yore to come and see us  aye aye said the father impatiently hooll come
hoos a bit set up now because hoo thinks i might ha spoken more civilly but hooll think better on it and come
i can read her proud bonny face like a book
come along bess theres the mill bell ringing  margaret went home wondering at her new friends and smiling at the mans insight into what had been passing in her mind
from that day milton became a brighter place to her
it was not the long bleak sunny days of spring nor yet was it that time was reconciling her to the town of her habitation
it was that in it she had found a human interest
dressing for tea
let chinas earth enriched with coloured stains     pencild with gold and streaked with azure veins     the grateful flavour of the indian leaf     or mochas sunburnt berry glad receive               mrs barbould
the day after this meeting with higgins and his daughter mr hale came upstairs into the little drawingroom at an unusual hour
he went up to different objects in the room as if examining them but margaret saw that it was merely a nervous tricka way of putting off something he wished yet feared to say
out it came at last  my dear
ive asked mr thornton to come to tea tonight  mrs hale was leaning back in her easy chair with her eyes shut and an expression of pain on her face which had become habitual to her of late
but she roused up into querulousness at this speech of her husbands
mr
thorntonand tonight
what in the world does the man want to come here for
and dixon is washing my muslins and laces and there is no soft water with these horrid east winds which i suppose we shall have all the year round in milton
the wind is veering round my dear said mr hale looking out at the smoke which drifted right from the east only he did not yet understand the points of the compass and rather arranged them ad libitum according to circumstances
dont tell me said mrs hale shuddering up and wrapping her shawl about her still more closely
but east or west wind i suppose this man comes  oh mamma that shows you never saw mr thornton
he looks like a person who would enjoy battling with every adverse thing he could meet withenemies winds or circumstances
the more it rains and blows the more certain we are to have him
but ill go and help dixon
im getting to be a famous clearstarcher
and he wont want any amusement beyond talking to papa
papa i am really longing to see the pythias to your damon
you know i never saw him but once and then we were so puzzled to know what to say to each other that we did not get on particularly well  i dont know that you would ever like him or think him agreeable margaret
he is not a ladys man  margaret wreathed her throat in a scornful curve
i dont particularly admire ladies men papa
but mr thornton comes here as your friendas one who has appreciated you  the only person in milton said mrs hale
so we will give him a welcome and some cocoanut cakes
dixon will be flattered if we ask her to make some and i will undertake to iron your caps mamma  many a time that morning did margaret wish mr thornton far enough away
she had planned other employments for herself a letter to edith a good piece of dante a visit to the higginses
but instead she ironed away listening to dixons complaints and only hoping that by an excess of sympathy she might prevent her from carrying the recital of her sorrows to mrs hale
every now and then margaret had to remind herself of her fathers regard for mr thornton to subdue the irritation of weariness that was stealing over her and bringing on one of the bad headaches to which she had lately become liable
she could hardly speak when she sat down at last and told her mother that she was no longer peggy the laundrymaid but margaret hale the lady
she meant this speech for a little joke and was vexed enough with her busy tongue when she found her mother taking it seriously
yes
if any one had told me when i was miss beresford and one of the belles of the country that a child of mine would have to stand half a day in a little poky kitchen working away like any servant that we might prepare properly for the reception of a tradesman and that this tradesman should be the only  oh mamma said margaret lifting herself up dont punish me for so careless a speech
i dont mind ironing or any kind of work for you and papa
i am myself a born and bred lady through it all even though it comes to scouring a floor or washing dishes
i am tired now just for a little while but in half an hour i shall be ready to do the same over again
and as to mr thorntons being in trade why he cant help that now poor fellow
i dont suppose his education would fit him for much else margaret lifted herself slowly up and went to her own room for just now she could not bear much more
in mr thorntons house at this very same time a similar yet different scene was going on
a largeboned lady long past middle age sat at work in a grim handsomelyfurnished diningroom
her features like her frame were strong and massive rather than heavy
her face moved slowly from one decided expression to another equally decided
there was no great variety in her countenance but those who looked at it once generally looked at it again even the passers by in the street halfturned their heads to gaze an instant longer at the firm severe dignified woman who never gave way in streetcourtesy or paused in her straightonward course to the clearly defined end which she proposed to herself
she was handsomely dressed in stout black silk of which not a thread was worn or discoloured
she was mending a large long tablecloth of the finest texture holding it up against the light occasionally to discover thin places which required her delicate care
there was not a book about in the room with the exception of matthew henrys bible commentaries six volumes of which lay in the centre of the massive sideboard flanked by a teaurn on one side and a lamp on the other
in some remote apartment there was exercise upon the piano going on
someone was practising up a morceau de salon playing it very rapidly every third note on an average being either indistinct or wholly missed out and the loud chords at the end being half of them false but not the less satisfactory to the performer
mrs thornton heard a step like her own in its decisive character pass the diningroom door
john
is that you  her son opened the door and showed himself
what has brought you home so early
i thought you were going to tea with that friend of mr bells that mr hale  so i am mother
i am come home to dress  dress
humph
when i was a girl young men were satisfied with dressing once in a day
why should you dress to go and take a cup of tea with an old parson  mr
hale is a gentleman and his wife and daughter are ladies  wife and daughter
do they teach too
what do they do
you have never mentioned them  no
mother because i have never seen mrs hale i have only seen miss hale for half an hour  take care you dont get caught by a penniless girl john  i am not easily caught mother as i think you know
but i must not have miss hale spoken of in that way which you know is offensive to me
i never was aware of any young lady trying to catch me yet nor do i believe that any one has ever given themselves that useless trouble  mrs thornton did not choose to yield the point to her son or else she had in general pride enough for her sex
well
i only say take care
perhaps our milton girls have too much spirit and good feeling to go angling after husbands but this miss hale comes out of the aristocratic counties where if all tales be true rich husbands are reckoned prizes  mr thorntons brow contracted and he came a step forward into the room
mother with a short scornful laugh you will make me confess
the only time i saw miss hale she treated me with a haughty civility which had a strong flavour of contempt in it
she held herself aloof from me as if she had been a queen and i her humble unwashed vassal
be easy mother  no
i am not easy nor content either
what business had she a renegade clergymans daughter to turn up her nose at you
i would dress for none of thema saucy set
if i were you as he was leaving the room he said  mr
hale is good and gentle and learned
he is not saucy
as for mrs hale i will tell you what she is like tonight if you care to hear he shut the door and was gone
despise my son
treat him as her vassal indeed
humph
i should like to know where she could find such another
boy and man hes the noblest stoutest heart i ever knew
i dont care if i am his mother i can see whats what and not be blind
i know what fanny is and i know what john is
despise him
i hate her      wrought iron and gold
we are the trees whom shaking fastens more               george herbert
mr thornton left the house without coming into the diningroom again
he was rather late and walked rapidly out to crampton
he was anxious not to slight his new friend by any disrespectful unpunctuality
the churchclock struck halfpast seven as he stood at the door awaiting dixons slow movements always doubly tardy when she had to degrade herself by answering the doorbell
he was ushered into the little drawingroom and kindly greeted by mr hale who led him up to his wife whose pale face and shawldraped figure made a silent excuse for the cold languor of her greeting
margaret was lighting the lamp when he entered for the darkness was coming on
the lamp threw a pretty light into the centre of the dusky room from which with country habits they did not exclude the nightskies and the outer darkness of air
somehow that room contrasted itself with the one he had lately left handsome ponderous with no sign of female habitation except in the one spot where his mother sate and no convenience for any other employment than eating and drinking
to be sure it was a diningroom his mother preferred to sit in it and her will was a household law
but the drawingroom was not like this
it was twicetwenty times as fine not one quarter as comfortable
here were no mirrors not even a scrap of glass to reflect the light and answer the same purpose as water in a landscape no gilding a warm sober breadth of colouring well relieved by the dear old helstone chintzcurtains and chair covers
an open davenport stood in the window opposite the door in the other there was a stand with a tall white china vase from which drooped wreaths of english ivy pale green birch and coppercoloured beechleaves
pretty baskets of work stood about in different places and books not cared for on account of their binding solely lay on one table as if recently put down
behind the door was another table decked out for tea with a white tablecloth on which flourished the cocoanut cakes and a basket piled with oranges and ruddy american apples heaped on leaves
it appeared to mr thornton that all these graceful cares were habitual to the family and especially of a piece with margaret
she stood by the teatable in a lightcoloured muslin gown which had a good deal of pink about it
she looked as if she was not attending to the conversation but solely busy with the teacups among which her round ivory hands moved with pretty noiseless daintiness
she had a bracelet on one taper arm which would fall down over her round wrist
mr thornton watched the replacing of this troublesome ornament with far more attention than he listened to her father
it seemed as if it fascinated him to see her push it up impatiently until it tightened her soft flesh and then to mark the looseningthe fall
he could almost have exclaimedthere it goes again there was so little left to be done after he arrived at the preparation for tea that he was almost sorry the obligation of eating and drinking came so soon to prevent him watching margaret
she handed him his cup of tea with the proud air of an unwilling slave but her eye caught the moment when he was ready for another cup and he almost longed to ask her to do for him what he saw her compelled to do for her father who took her little finger and thumb in his masculine hand and made them serve as sugartongues
mr thornton saw her beautiful eyes lifted to her father full of light halflaughter and halflove as this bit of pantomime went on between the two unobserved as they fancied by any
margarets head still ached as the paleness of her complexion and her silence might have testified but she was resolved to throw herself into the breach if there was any long untoward pause rather than that her fathers friend pupil and guest should have cause to think himself in any way neglected
but the conversation went on and margaret drew into a corner near her mother with her work after the teathings were taken away and felt that she might let her thoughts roam without fear of being suddenly wanted to fill up a gap
mr thornton and mr hale were both absorbed in the continuation of some object which had been started at their last meeting
margaret was recalled to a sense of the present by some trivial lowspoken remark of her mothers and on suddenly looking up from her work her eye was caught by the difference of outward appearance between her father and mr thornton as betokening such distinctly opposite natures
her father was of slight figure which made him appear taller than he really was when not contrasted as at this time with the tall massive frame of another
the lines in her fathers face were soft and waving with a frequent undulating kind of trembling movement passing over them showing every fluctuating emotion the eyelids were large and arched giving to the eyes a peculiar languid beauty which was almost feminine
the brows were finely arched but were by the very size of the dreamy lids raised to a considerable distance from the eyes
now in mr thorntons face the straight brows fell low over the clear deepset earnest eyes which without being unpleasantly sharp seemed intent enough to penetrate into the very heart and core of what he was looking at
the lines in the face were few but firm as if they were carved in marble and lay principally about the lips which were slightly compressed over a set of teeth so faultless and beautiful as to give the effect of sudden sunlight when the rare bright smile coming in an instant and shining out of the eyes changed the whole look from the severe and resolved expression of a man ready to do and dare everything to the keen honest enjoyment of the moment which is seldom shown so fearlessly and instantaneously except by children
margaret liked this smile it was the first thing she had admired in this new friend of her fathers and the opposition of character shown in all these details of appearance she had just been noticing seemed to explain the attraction they evidently felt towards each other
she rearranged her mothers worstedwork and fell back into her own thoughtsas completely forgotten by mr thornton as if she had not been in the room so thoroughly was he occupied in explaining to mr hale the magnificent power yet delicate adjustment of the might of the steamhammer which was recalling to mr hale some of the wonderful stories of subservient genii in the arabian nightsone moment stretching from earth to sky and filling all the width of the horizon at the next obediently compressed into a vase small enough to be borne in the hand of a child
and this imagination of power this practical realisation of a gigantic thought came out of one mans brain in our good town
that very man has it within him to mount step by step on each wonder he achieves to higher marvels still
and ill be bound to say we have many among us who if he were gone could spring into the breach and carry on the war which compels and shall compel all material power to yield to science  your boast reminds me of the old lines      ive a hundred captains in england he said       as good as ever was he  at her fathers quotation margaret looked suddenly up with inquiring wonder in her eyes
how in the world had they got from the cogwheels to chevy chace
it is no boast of mine replied mr thornton it is plain matteroffact
i wont deny that i am proud of belonging to a townor perhaps i should rather say a districtthe necessities of which give birth to such grandeur of conception
i would rather be a man toiling sufferingnay failing and successlesshere than lead a dull prosperous life in the old worn grooves of what you call more aristocratic society down in the south with their slow days of careless ease
one may be clogged with honey and unable to rise and fly  you are mistaken said margaret roused by the aspersion on her beloved south to a fond vehemence of defence that brought the colour into her cheeks and the angry tears into her eyes
you do not know anything about the south
if there is less adventure or less progressi suppose i must not say less excitementfrom the gambling spirit of trade which seems requisite to force out these wonderful inventions there is less suffering also
i see men here going about in the streets who look ground down by some pinching sorrow or carewho are not only sufferers but haters
now in the south we have our poor but there is not that terrible expression in their countenances of a sullen sense of injustice which i see here
you do not know the south mr thornton she concluded collapsing into a determined silence and angry with herself for having said so much
and may i say you do not know the north asked he with an inexpressible gentleness in his tone as he saw that he had really hurt her
she continued resolutely silent yearning after the lovely haunts she had left far away in hampshire with a passionate longing that made her feel her voice would be unsteady and trembling if she spoke
at any rate mr thornton said mrs hale you will allow that milton is a much more smoky dirty town than you will ever meet with in the south  im afraid i must give up its cleanliness said mr thornton with the quick gleaming smile
but we are bidden by parliament to burn our own smoke so i suppose like good little children we shall do as we are bidsome time  but i think you told me you had altered your chimneys so as to consume the smoke did you not asked mr hale
mine were altered by my own will before parliament meddled with the affair
it was an immediate outlay but it repays me in the saving of coal
im not sure whether i should have done it if i had waited until the act was passed
at any rate i should have waited to be informed against and fined and given all the trouble in yielding that i legally could
but all laws which depend for their enforcement upon informers and fines become inert from the odiousness of the machinery
i doubt if there has been a chimney in milton informed against for five years past although some are constantly sending out onethird of their coal in what is called here unparliamentary smoke  i only know it is impossible to keep the muslin blinds clean here above a week together and at helstone we have had them up for a month or more and they have not looked dirty at the end of that time
and as for handsmargaret how many times did you say you had washed your hands this morning before twelve oclock
three times was it not  yes mamma  you seem to have a strong objection to acts of parliament and all legislation affecting your mode of management down here at milton said mr hale
yes i have and many others have as well
and with justice i think
the whole machineryi dont mean the wood and iron machinery nowof the cotton trade is so new that it is no wonder if it does not work well in every part all at once
seventy years ago what was it
and now what it is not
raw crude materials came together men of the same level as regarded education and station took suddenly the different position of masters and men owing to the motherwit as regarded opportunities and probabilities which distinguished some and made them farseeing as to what great future lay concealed in that rude model of sir richard arkwrights
the rapid development of what might be called a new trade gave those early masters enormous power of wealth and command
i dont mean merely over the workmen i mean over purchasersover the whole worlds market
why i may give you as an instance an advertisement inserted not fifty years ago in a milton paper that soandso one of the halfdozen calicoprinters of the time would close his warehouse at noon each day therefore that all purchasers must come before that hour
fancy a man dictating in this manner the time when he would sell and when he would not sell
now i believe if a good customer chose to come at midnight i should get up and stand hat in hand to receive his orders  margarets lip curled but somehow she was compelled to listen she could no longer abstract herself in her own thoughts
i only name such things to show what almost unlimited power the manufacturers had about the beginning of this century
the men were rendered dizzy by it
because a man was successful in his ventures there was no reason that in all other things his mind should be wellbalanced
on the contrary his sense of justice and his simplicity were often utterly smothered under the glut of wealth that came down upon him and they tell strange tales of the wild extravagance of living indulged in on galadays by those early cottonlords
there can be no doubt too of the tyranny they exercised over their workpeople
you know the proverb mr hale set a beggar on horseback and hell ride to the devilwell some of these early manufacturers did ride to the devil in a magnificent stylecrushing human bone and flesh under their horses hoofs without remorse
but byandby came a reaction there were more factories more masters more men were wanted
the power of masters and men became more evenly balanced and now the battle is pretty fairly waged between us
we will hardly submit to the decision of an umpire much less to the interference of a meddler with only a smattering of the knowledge of the real facts of the case even though that meddler be called the high court of parliament  is there necessity for calling it a battle between the two classes asked mr hale
i know from your using the term it is one which gives a true idea of the real state of things to your mind  it is true and i believe it to be as much a necessity as that prudent wisdom and good conduct are always opposed to and doing battle with ignorance and improvidence
it is one of the great beauties of our system that a workingman may raise himself into the power and position of a master by his own exertions and behaviour that in fact every one who rules himself to decency and sobriety of conduct and attention to his duties comes over to our ranks it may not be always as a master but as an overlooker a cashier a bookkeeper a clerk one on the side of authority and order  you consider all who are unsuccessful in raising themselves in the world from whatever cause as your enemies then if i understand you rightly said margaret in a clear cold voice
as their own enemies certainly said he quickly not a little piqued by the haughty disapproval her form of expression and tone of speaking implied
but in a moment his straightforward honesty made him feel that his words were but a poor and quibbling answer to what she had said and be she as scornful as she liked it was a duty he owed to himself to explain as truly as he could what he did mean
yet it was very difficult to separate her interpretation and keep it distinct from his meaning
he could best have illustrated what he wanted to say by telling them something of his own life but was it not too personal a subject to speak about to strangers
still it was the simple straightforward way of explaining his meaning so putting aside the touch of shyness that brought a momentary flush of colour into his dark cheek he said  i am not speaking without book
sixteen years ago my father died under very miserable circumstances
i was taken from school and had to become a man as well as i could in a few days
i had such a mother as few are blest with a woman of strong power and firm resolve
we went into a small country town where living was cheaper than in milton and where i got employment in a drapers shop a capital place by the way for obtaining a knowledge of goods
week by week our income came to fifteen shillings out of which three people had to be kept
my mother managed so that i put by three out of these fifteen shillings regularly
this made the beginning this taught me selfdenial
now that i am able to afford my mother such comforts as her age rather than her own wish requires i thank her silently on each occasion for the early training she gave me
now when i feel that in my own case it is no good luck nor merit nor talentbut simply the habits of life which taught me to despise indulgences not thoroughly earnedindeed never to think twice about themi believe that this suffering which miss hale says is impressed on the countenances of the people of milton is but the natural punishment of dishonestlyenjoyed pleasure at some former period of their lives
i do not look on selfindulgent sensual people as worthy of my hatred i simply look upon them with contempt for their poorness of character  but you have the rudiments of a good education remarked mr hale
the quick zest with which you are now reading homer shows me that you do not come to it as an unknown book you have read it before and are only recalling your old knowledge  that is truei had blundered along it at school i dare say i was even considered a pretty fair classic in those days though my latin and greek have slipt away from me since
but i ask you what preparation were they for such a life as i had to lead
none at all
utterly none at all
on the point of education any man who can read and write starts fair with me in the amount of really useful knowledge that i had at that time  well
i dont agree with you
but there i am perhaps somewhat of a pedant
did not the recollection of the heroic simplicity of the homeric life nerve you up  not one bit exclaimed mr thornton laughing
i was too busy to think about any dead people with the living pressing alongside of me neck to neck in the struggle for bread
now that i have my mother safe in the quiet peace that becomes her age and duly rewards her former exertions i can turn to all that old narration and thoroughly enjoy it  i dare say my remark came from the professional feeling of there being nothing like leather replied mr hale
when mr thornton rose up to go away after shaking hands with mr and mrs hale he made an advance to margaret to wish her goodbye in a similar manner
it was the frank familiar custom of the place but margaret was not prepared for it
she simply bowed her farewell although the instant she saw the hand half put out quickly drawn back she was sorry she had not been aware of the intention
mr thornton however knew nothing of her sorrow and drawing himself up to his full height walked off muttering as he left the house  a more proud disagreeable girl i never saw
even her great beauty is blotted out of ones memory by her scornful ways      first impressions
theres iron they say in all our blood     and a grain or two perhaps is good     but his he makes me harshly feel     has got a little too much of steel               anon
margaret said mr hale as he returned from showing his guest downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mr thornton made his confession of having been a shopboy
i knew it all along from mr bell so i was aware of what was coming but i half expected to see you get up and leave the room  oh papa
you dont mean that you thought me so silly
i really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said
everything else revolted me from its hardness but he spoke about himself so simplywith so little of the pretence that makes the vulgarity of shoppeople and with such tender respect for his mother that i was less likely to leave the room then than when he was boasting about milton as if there was not such another place in the world or quietly professing to despise people for careless wasteful improvidence without ever seeming to think it his duty to try to make them differentto give them anything of the training which his mother gave him and to which he evidently owes his position whatever that may be
no
his statement of having been a shopboy was the thing i liked best of all  i am surprised at you margaret said her mother
you who were always accusing people of being shoppy at helstone
i dont think mr hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
his father dying in miserable circumstances why it might have been in the workhouse  i am not sure it was not worse than being in the workhouse replied her husband
i heard a good deal of his previous life from mr bell before we came here and as he has told you a part i will fill up what he left out
his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
all his former friends shrunk from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gamblingwild hopeless struggles made with other peoples money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
no one came forward to help the mother and this boy
there was another child i believe a girl too young to earn money but of course she had to be kept
at least no friend came forward immediately and mrs thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
so they left milton
i knew he had gone into a shop and that his earnings with some fragment of property secured to his mother had been made to keep them for a long time
mr bell said they absolutely lived upon waterporridge for yearshow he did not know but long after the creditors had given up hope of any payment of old mr thorntons debts if indeed they ever had hoped at all about it after his suicide this young man returned to milton and went quietly round to each creditor paying him the first instalment of the money owing to him
no noiseno gathering together of creditorsit was done very silently and quietly but all was paid at last helped on materially by the circumstance of one of the creditors a crabbed old fellow mr bell says taking in mr thornton as a kind of partner  that really is fine said margaret
what a pity such a nature should be tainted by his position as a milton manufacturer  how tainted asked her father
oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
and the poor men around himthey were poor because they were viciousout of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich  not vicious he never said that
improvident and selfindulgent were his words  margaret was collecting her mothers working materials and preparing to go to bed
just as she was leaving the room she hesitatedshe was inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
however out it came
papa i do think mr thornton a very remarkable man but personally i dont like him at all  and i do said her father laughing
personally as you call it and all
i dont set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
but goodnight child
your mother looks sadly tired tonight margaret  margaret had noticed her mothers jaded appearance with anxiety for some time past and this remark of her fathers sent her up to bed with a dim fear lying like a weight on her heart
the life in milton was so different from what mrs hale had been accustomed to live in helstone in and out perpetually into the fresh and open air the air itself was so different deprived of all revivifying principle as it seemed to be here the domestic worries pressed so very closely and in so new and sordid a form upon all the women in the family that there was good reason to fear that her mothers health might be becoming seriously affected
there were several other signs of something wrong about mrs hale
she and dixon held mysterious consultations in her bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was her custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
margaret yearned to reunite the bond of intimate confidence which had been broken by her long residence at her aunt shaws and strove by gentle caresses and softened words to creep into the warmest place in her mothers heart
but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mothers health
she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of their milton life on her mother
a servant to give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up her whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
visiting register offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margarets time and thoughts for several days
one afternoon she met bessy higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
well bessy how are you
better i hope now the wind has changed  better and not better if yo know what that means  not exactly replied margaret smiling
im better in not being torn to pieces by coughing o nights but im weary and tired o milton and longing to get away to the land o beulah
and when i think im farther and farther off my heart sinks and im no better im worse  margaret turned round to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
but for a minute or two she did not speak
at last she said in a low voice  bessy do you wish to die for she shrank from death herself with all the clinging to life so natural to the young and healthy
bessy was silent in her turn for a minute or two
then she replied  if yod led the life i have and getten as weary of it as i have and thought at times maybe itll last for fifty or sixty yearsit does wi someand got dizzy and dazed and sick as each of them sixty years seemed to spin about me and mock me with its length of hours and minutes and endless bits o timeoh wench
i tell thee thoud been glad enough when th doctor said he feared thoud never see another winter  why bessy what kind of a life has yours been  nought worse than many others i reckon
only i fretted against it and they didnt  but what was it
you know im a stranger here so perhaps im not so quick at understanding what you mean as if id lived all my life at milton  if yod ha come to our house when yo said yo would i could maybe ha told you
but father says yore just like th rest on em its out o sight out o mind wi you  i dont know who the rest are and ive been very busy and to tell the truth i had forgotten my promise  yo offered it we asked none of it  i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
i should have thought of it again when i was less busy
may i go with you now  bessy gave a quick glance at margarets face to see if the wish expressed was really felt
the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margarets soft and friendly gaze
i ha none so many to care for me if yo care yo may come  so they walked on together in silence
as they turned up into a small court out of a squalid street bessy said  yoll not be daunted if fathers at home and speaks a bit gruffish at first
he took a mind to ye yo see and he thought a deal o your coming to see us and just because he liked yo he was vexed and put about  dont fear bessy  but nicholas was not at home when they entered
a great slatternly girl not so old as bessy but taller and stronger was busy at the washtub knocking about the furniture in a rough capable way but altogether making so much noise that margaret shrunk out of sympathy with poor bessy who had sat down on the first chair as if completely tired out with her walk
margaret asked the sister for a cup of water and while she ran to fetch it knocking down the fireirons and tumbling over a chair in her way she unloosed bessys bonnet strings to relieve her catching breath
do you think such life as this is worth caring for gasped bessy at last
margaret did not speak but held the water to her lips
bessy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
margaret heard her murmur to herself they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat  margaret bent over and said bessy dont be impatient with your life whatever it isor may have been
remember who gave it you and made it what it is  she was startled by hearing nicholas speak behind her he had come in without her noticing him
now ill not have my wench preached to
shes bad enough as it is with her dreams and her methodee fancies and her visions of cities with goulden gates and precious stones
but if it amuses her i let it abe but im none going to have more stuff poured into her  but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be  i believe what i see and no more
thats what i believe young woman
i dont believe all i hearno
not by a big deal
i did hear a young lass make an ado about knowing where we lived and coming to see us
and my wench here thought a deal about it and flushed up many a time when hoo little knew as i was looking at her at the sound of a strange step
but hoos come at lastand hoos welcome as long as hooll keep from preaching on what hoo knows nought about  bessy had been watching margarets face she half sate up to speak now laying her hand on margarets arm with a gesture of entreaty
dont be vexed wi himtheres many a one thinks like him many and many a one here
if yo could hear them speak yod not be shocked at him hes a rare good man is fatherbut oh said she falling back in despair what he says at times makes me long to die more than ever for i want to know so many things and am so tossed about wi wonder  poor wenchpoor old wenchim loth to vex thee i am but a man mun speak out for the truth and when i see the world going all wrong at this time o day bothering itself wi things it knows nought about and leaving undone all the things that lie in disorder close at its handwhy i say leave a this talk about religion alone and set to work on what yo see and know
thats my creed
its simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work  but the girl only pleaded the more with margaret
dont think hardly on himhes a good man he is
i sometimes think i shall be moped wi sorrow even in the city of god if father is not there the feverish colour came into her cheek and the feverish flame into her eye
but you will be there father
you shall
oh
my heart she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
she lifted the thin soft hair from off the temples and bathed them with water
nicholas understood all her signs for different articles with the quickness of love and even the roundeyed sister moved with laborious gentleness at margarets hush presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away and bessy roused herself and said  ill go to bedits best place but catching at margarets gown yoll come againi know yo willbut just say it  i will come again tomorrow said margaret
bessy leant back against her father who prepared to carry her upstairs but as margaret rose to go he struggled to say something i could wish there were a god if it were only to ask him to bless thee  margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
she was late for tea at home
at helstone unpunctuality at mealtimes was a great fault in her mothers eyes but now this as well as many other little irregularities seemed to have lost their power of irritation and margaret almost longed for the old complainings
have you met with a servant dear  no mamma that anne buckley would never have done  suppose i try said mr hale
everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty
now let me try
i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all  margaret could hardly smile at this little joke so oppressed was she by her visit to the higginses
what would you do papa
how would you set about it  why i should apply to some good housemother to recommend me one known to herself or her servants  very good
but we must first catch our housemother  you have caught her
or rather she is coming into the snare and you will catch her tomorrow if youre skilful  what do you mean mr hale asked his wife her curiosity aroused
why my paragon pupil as margaret calls him has told me that his mother intends to call on mrs and miss hale tomorrow  mrs
thornton exclaimed mrs hale
the mother of whom he spoke to us said margaret
mrs
thornton the only mother he has i believe said mr hale quietly
i shall like to see her
she must be an uncommon person her mother added
perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
she sounded to be such a careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family  my dear said mr hale alarmed
pray dont go off on that idea
i fancy mrs thornton is as haughty and proud in her way as our little margaret here is in hers and that she completely ignores that old time of trial and poverty and economy of which he speaks so openly
i am sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it  take notice that is not my kind of haughtiness papa if i have any at all which i dont agree to though youre always accusing me of it  i dont know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so  they cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her
margaret only wanted to know if she must stay in to receive this call as it would prevent her going to see how bessy was until late in the day since the early morning was always occupied in household affairs and then she recollected that her mother must not be left to have the whole weight of entertaining her visitor
morning calls
welli suppose we must               friends in council
mr thornton had had some difficulty in working up his mother to the desired point of civility
she did not often make calls and when she did it was in heavy state that she went through her duties
her son had given her a carriage but she refused to let him keep horses for it they were hired for the solemn occasions when she paid morning or evening visits
she had had horses for three days not a fortnight before and had comfortably killed off all her acquaintances who might now put themselves to trouble and expense in their turn
yet crampton was too far off for her to walk and she had repeatedly questioned her son as to whether his wish that she should call on the hales was strong enough to bear the expense of cabhire
she would have been thankful if it had not for as she said she saw no use in making up friendships and intimacies with all the teachers and masters in milton why he would be wanting her to call on fannys dancingmasters wife the next thing  and so i would mother if mr mason and his wife were friendless in a strange place like the hales  oh
you need not speak so hastily
i am going tomorrow
i only wanted you exactly to understand about it  if you are going tomorrow i shall order horses  nonsense john
one would think you were made of money  not quite yet
but about the horses im determined
the last time you were out in a cab you came home with a headache from the jolting  i never complained of it im sure  no
my mother is not given to complaints said he a little proudly
but so much the more i have to watch over you
now as for fanny there a little hardship would do her good  she is not made of the same stuff as you are john
she could not bear it  mrs thornton was silent after this for her last words bore relation to a subject which mortified her
she had an unconscious contempt for a weak character and fanny was weak in the very points in which her mother and brother were strong
mrs thornton was not a woman much given to reasoning her quick judgment and firm resolution served her in good stead of any long arguments and discussions with herself she felt instinctively that nothing could strengthen fanny to endure hardships patiently or face difficulties bravely and though she winced as she made this acknowledgment to herself about her daughter it only gave her a kind of pitying tenderness of manner towards her much of the same description of demeanour with which mothers are wont to treat their weak and sickly children
a stranger a careless observer might have considered that mrs thorntons manner to her children betokened far more love to fanny than to john
but such a one would have been deeply mistaken
the very daringness with which mother and son spoke out unpalatable truths the one to the other showed a reliance on the firm centre of each others souls which the uneasy tenderness of mrs thorntons manner to her daughter the shame with which she thought to hide the poverty of her child in all the grand qualities which she herself possessed unconsciously and which she set so high a value upon in othersthis shame i say betrayed the want of a secure restingplace for her affection
she never called her son by any name but john love and dear and such like terms were reserved for fanny
but her heart gave thanks for him day and night and she walked proudly among women for his sake
fanny dear
i shall have horses to the carriage today to go and call on these hales
should not you go and see nurse
its in the same direction and shes always so glad to see you
you could go on there while i am at mrs hales  oh
mamma its such a long way and i am so tired  with what asked mrs thornton her brow slightly contracting
i dont knowthe weather i think
it is so relaxing
couldnt you bring nurse here mamma
the carriage could fetch her and she could spend the rest of the day here which i know she would like  mrs thornton did not speak but she laid her work on the table and seemed to think
it will be a long way for her to walk back at night she remarked at last
oh but i will send her home in a cab
i never thought of her walking  at this point mr thornton came in just before going to the mill
mother
i need hardly say that if there is any little thing that could serve mrs hale as an invalid you will offer it im sure  if i can find it out i will
but i have never been ill myself so i am not much up to invalids fancies  well
here is fanny then who is seldom without an ailment
she will be able to suggest something perhapswont you fan  i have not always an ailment said fanny pettishly and i am not going with mamma
i have a headache today and i shant go out  mr thornton looked annoyed
his mothers eyes were bent on her work at which she was now stitching away busily
fanny
i wish you to go said he authoritatively
it will do you good instead of harm
you will oblige me by going without my saying anything more about it  he went abruptly out of the room after saying this
if he had stayed a minute longer fanny would have cried at his tone of command even when he used the words you will oblige me as it was she grumbled
john always speaks as if i fancied i was ill and i am sure i never do fancy any such thing
who are these hales that he makes such a fuss about  fanny dont speak so of your brother
he has good reasons of some kind or other or he would not wish us to go
make haste and put your things on  but the little altercation between her son and her daughter did not incline mrs thornton more favourably towards these hales her jealous heart repeated her daughters question who are they that he is so anxious we should pay them all this attention it came up like a burden to a song long after fanny had forgotten all about it in the pleasant excitement of seeing the effect of a new bonnet in the lookingglass
mrs thornton was shy
it was only of late years that she had had leisure enough in her life to go into society and as society she did not enjoy it
as dinnergiving and as criticising other peoples dinners she took satisfaction in it
but this going to make acquaintance with strangers was a very different thing
she was ill at ease and looked more than usually stern and forbidding as she entered the hales little drawingroom
margaret was busy embroidering a small piece of cambric for some little article of dress for ediths expected babyflimsy useless work as mrs thornton observed to herself
she liked mrs hales double knitting far better that was sensible of its kind
the room altogether was full of knickknacks which must take a long time to dust and time to people of limited income was money
she made all these reflections as she was talking in her stately way to mrs hale and uttering all the stereotyped commonplaces that most people can find to say with their senses blindfolded
mrs hale was making rather more exertion in her answers captivated by some real old lace which mrs thornton wore lace as she afterwards observed to dixon of that old english point which has not been made for this seventy years and which cannot be bought
it must have been an heirloom and shows that she had ancestors so the owner of the ancestral lace became worthy of something more than the languid exertion to be agreeable to a visitor by which mrs hales efforts at conversation would have been otherwise bounded
and presently margaret racking her brain to talk to fanny heard her mother and mrs thornton plunge into the interminable subject of servants
i suppose you are not musical said fanny as i see no piano  i am fond of hearing good music i cannot play well myself and papa and mamma dont care much about it so we sold our old piano when we came here  i wonder how you can exist without one
it almost seems to me a necessary of life  fifteen shillings a week and three saved out of them thought margaret to herself
but she must have been very young
she probably has forgotten her own personal experience
but she must know of those days margarets manner had an extra tinge of coldness in it when she next spoke
you have good concerts here i believe  oh yes
delicious
too crowded that is the worst
the directors admit so indiscriminately
but one is sure to hear the newest music there
i always have a large order to give to johnsons the day after a concert  do you like new music simply for its newness then  oh one knows it is the fashion in london or else the singers would not bring it down here
you have been in london of course  yes said margaret i have lived there for several years  oh
london and the alhambra are the two places i long to see  london and the alhambra  yes
ever since i read the tales of the alhambra
dont you know them  i dont think i do
but surely it is a very easy journey to london  yes but somehow said fanny lowering her voice mamma has never been to london herself and cant understand my longing
she is very proud of milton dirty smoky place as i feel it to be
i believe she admires it the more for those very qualities  if it has been mrs thorntons home for some years i can well understand her loving it said margaret in her clear belllike voice
what are you saying about me miss hale
may i inquire  margaret had not the words ready for an answer to this question which took her a little by surprise so miss thornton replied  oh mamma
we are only trying to account for your being so fond of milton  thank you said mrs thornton
i do not feel that my very natural liking for the place where i was born and brought upand which has since been my residence for some years requires any accounting for  margaret was vexed
as fanny had put it it did seem as if they had been impertinently discussing mrs thorntons feelings but she also rose up against that ladys manner of showing that she was offended
mrs thornton went on after a moments pause  do you know anything of milton miss hale
have you seen any of our factories
our magnificent warehouses  no said margaret
i have not seen anything of that description as yet  then she felt that by concealing her utter indifference to all such places she was hardly speaking with truth so she went on  i dare say papa would have taken me before now if i had cared
but i really do not find much pleasure in going over manufactories  they are very curious places said mrs hale but there is so much noise and dirt always
i remember once going in a lilac silk to see candles made and my gown was utterly ruined  very probably said mrs thornton in a short displeased manner
i merely thought that as strangers newly come to reside in a town which has risen to eminence in the country from the character and progress of its peculiar business you might have cared to visit some of the places where it is carried on places unique in the kingdom i am informed
if miss hale changes her mind and condescends to be curious as to the manufactures of milton i can only say i shall be glad to procure her admission to printworks or reedmaking or the more simple operations of spinning carried on in my sons mill
every improvement of machinery is i believe to be seen there in its highest perfection  i am so glad you dont like mills and manufactories and all those kind of things said fanny in a halfwhisper as she rose to accompany her mother who was taking leave of mrs hale with rustling dignity
i think i should like to know all about them if i were you replied margaret quietly
fanny said her mother as they drove away we will be civil to these hales but dont form one of your hasty friendships with the daughter
she will do you no good i see
the mother looks very ill and seems a nice quiet kind of person  i dont want to form any friendship with miss hale mamma said fanny pouting
i thought i was doing my duty by talking to her and trying to amuse her  well
at any rate john must be satisfied now      soft breeze in a sultry place
that doubt and trouble fear and pain     and anguish all are shadows vain     that death itself shall not remain      that weary deserts we may tread     a dreary labyrinth may thread
thro dark ways underground be led      yet if we will one guide obey     the dreariest path the darkest way     shall issue out in heavenly day      and we on divers shores now cast     shall meet our perilous voyage past     all in our fathers house at last               r c trench
margaret flew up stairs as soon as their visitors were gone and put on her bonnet and shawl to run and inquire how betsy higgins was and sit with her as long as she could before dinner
as she went along the crowded narrow streets she felt how much of interest they had gained by the simple fact of her having learnt to care for a dweller in them
mary higgins the slatternly younger sister had endeavoured as well as she could to tidy up the house for the expected visit
there had been roughstoning done in the middle of the floor while the flags under the chairs and table and round the walls retained their dark unwashed appearance
although the day was hot there burnt a large fire in the grate making the whole place feel like an oven margaret did not understand that the lavishness of coals was a sign of hospitable welcome to her on marys part and thought that perhaps the oppressive heat was necessary for bessy
bessy herself lay on a squab or short sofa placed under the window
she was very much more feeble than on the previous day and tired with raising herself at every step to look out and see if it was margaret coming
and now that margaret was there and had taken a chair by her bessy lay back silent and content to look at margarets face and touch her articles of dress with a childish admiration of their fineness of texture
i never knew why folk in the bible cared for soft raiment afore
but it must be nice to go dressed as yo do
its different fro common
most fine folk tire my eyes out wi their colours but some how yours rest me
where did ye get this frock  in london said margaret much amused
london
have yo been in london  yes
i lived there for some years
but my home was in a forest in the country  tell me about it said bessy
i like to hear speak of the country and trees and such like things she leant back and shut her eyes and crossed her hands over her breast lying at perfect rest as if to receive all the ideas margaret could suggest
margaret had never spoken of helstone since she left it except just naming the place incidentally
she saw it in dreams more vivid than life and as she fell away to slumber at nights her memory wandered in all its pleasant places
but her heart was opened to this girl oh bessy i loved the home we have left so dearly
i wish you could see it
i cannot tell you half its beauty
there are great trees standing all about it with their branches stretching long and level and making a deep shade of rest even at noonday
and yet though every leaf may seem still there is a continual rushing sound of movement all aroundnot close at hand
then sometimes the turf is as soft and fine as velvet and sometimes quite lush with the perpetual moisture of a little hidden tinkling brook near at hand
and then in other parts there are billowy fernswhole stretches of fern some in the green shadow some with long streaks of golden sunlight lying on themjust like the sea  i have never seen the sea murmured bessy
but go on  then here and there there are wide commons high up as if above the very tops of the trees  i am glad of that
i felt smothered like down below
when i have gone for an out ive always wanted to get high up and see far away and take a deep breath o fulness in that air
i get smothered enough in milton and i think the sound yo speak of among the trees going on for ever and ever would send me dazed its that made my head ache so in the mill
now on these commons i reckon there is but little noise  no said margaret nothing but here and there a lark high in the air
sometimes i used to hear a farmer speaking sharp and loud to his servants but it was so far away that it only reminded me pleasantly that other people were hard at work in some distant place while i just sat on the heather and did nothing  i used to think once that if i could have a day of doing nothing to rest mea day in some quiet place like that yo speak onit would maybe set me up
but now ive had many days o idleness and im just as weary o them as i was o my work
sometimes im so tired out i think i cannot enjoy heaven without a piece of rest first
im rather afeard o going straight there without getting a good sleep in the grave to set me up  dont be afraid bessy said margaret laying her hand on the girls hand god can give you more perfect rest than even idleness on earth or the dead sleep of the grave can do  bessy moved uneasily then she said  i wish father would not speak to me as he does
he means well as i telled yo yesterday and tell yo again and again
but yo see though i dont believe him a bit by day yet by nightwhen im in a fever half asleep and half awakeit comes back upon meoh
so bad
and i think if this should be th end of all and if all ive been born for is just to work my heart and my life away and to sicken i this dree place wi them millnoises in my ears for ever until i could scream out for them to stop and let me have a little piece o quietand wi the fluff filling my lungs until i thirst to death for one long deep breath o the clear air yo speak onand my mother gone and i never able to tell her again how i loved her and o all my troublesi think if this life is th end and theres no god to wipe away all tears from all eyesyo wench yo said she sitting up and clutching violently almost fiercely at margarets hand i could go mad and kill yo i could she fell back completely worn out with her passion
margaret knelt down by her
bessywe have a father in heaven  i know it
i know it moaned she turning her head uneasily from side to side
im very wicked
ive spoken very wickedly
oh
dont be frightened by me and never come again
i would not harm a hair of your head
and opening her eyes and looking earnestly at margaret i believe perhaps more than yo do o whats to come
i read the book o revelations until i know it off by heart and i never doubt when im waking and in my senses of all the glory im to come to  dont let us talk of what fancies come into your head when you are feverish
i would rather hear something about what you used to do when you were well  i think i was well when mother died but i have never been rightly strong sin somewhere about that time
i began to work in a cardingroom soon after and the fluff got into my lungs and poisoned me  fluff said margaret inquiringly
fluff repeated bessy
little bits as fly off fro the cotton when theyre carding it and fill the air till it looks all fine white dust
they say it winds rounds the lungs and tightens them up
anyhow theres many a one as works in a cardingroom that falls into a waste coughing and spitting blood because theyre just poisoned by the fluff  but cant it be helped asked margaret
i dunno
some folk have a great wheel at one end o their cardingrooms to make a draught and carry off th dust but that wheel costs a deal of moneyfive or six hundred pounds maybe and brings in no profit so its but a few of th masters as will put em up and ive heard tell o men who didnt like working in places where there was a wheel because they said as how it made em hungry at after theyd been long used to swallowing fluff to go without it and that their wages ought to be raised if they were to work in such places
so between masters and men th wheels fall through
i know i wish thered been a wheel in our place though  did not your father know about it asked margaret
yes
and he was sorry
but our factory were a good one on the whole and a steady likely set o people and father was afeard of letting me go to a strange place for though yo would na think it now many a one then used to call me a gradely lass enough
and i did na like to be reckoned nesh and soft and marys schooling were to be kept up mother said and father he were always liking to buy books and go to lectures o one kind and anotherall which took moneyso i just worked on till i shall neer get the whirr out o my ears or the fluff out o my throat i this world
thats all  how old are you asked margaret
nineteen come july  and i too am nineteen she thought more sorrowfully than bessy did of the contrast between them
she could not speak for a moment or two for the emotion she was trying to keep down
about mary said bessy
i wanted to ask yo to be a friend to her
shes seventeen but shes th last on us
and i dont want her to go to th mill and yet i dunno what shes fit for  she could not domargaret glanced unconsciously at the uncleaned corners of the roomshe could hardly undertake a servants place could she
we have an old faithful servant almost a friend who wants help but who is very particular and it would not be right to plague her with giving her any assistance that would really be an annoyance and an irritation  no i see
i reckon yore right
our marys a good wench but who has she had to teach her what to do about a house
no mother and me at the mill till i was good for nothing but scolding her for doing badly what i didnt know how to do a bit
but i wish she could ha lived wi yo for all that  but even though she may not be exactly fitted to come and live with us as a servantand i dont know about thati will always try to be a friend to her for your sake bessy
and now i must go
i will come again as soon as i can but if it should not be tomorrow or the next day or even a week or a fortnight hence dont think ive forgotten you
i may be busy  ill know yo wont forget me again
ill not mistrust yo no more
but remember in a week or a fortnight i may be dead and buried  ill come again as soon as i can bessy said margaret squeezing her hand tight
but youll let me know if you get worse  ay that will i said bessy returning the pressure
from that day forwards mrs hale became more and more of a suffering invalid
it was now drawing near to the anniversary of ediths marriage and looking back upon the years accumulated heap of troubles margaret wondered how they had been borne
if she could have anticipated them how she would have shrunk away and hid herself from the coming time
and yet day by day had of itself and by itself been very endurablesmall keen bright little spots of positive enjoyment having come sparkling into the very middle of sorrows
a year ago or when she first went to helstone and first became silently conscious of the querulousness in her mothers temper she would have groaned bitterly over the idea of a long illness to be borne in a strange desolate noisy busy place with diminished comforts on every side of the home life
but with the increase of serious and just ground of complaint a new kind of patience had sprung up in her mothers mind
she was gentle and quiet in intense bodily suffering almost in proportion as she had been restless and depressed when there had been no real cause for grief
mr hale was in exactly that stage of apprehension which in men of his stamp takes the shape of wilful blindness
he was more irritated than margaret had ever known him at his daughters expressed anxiety
indeed margaret you are growing fanciful
god knows i should be the first to take the alarm if your mother were really ill we always saw when she had her headaches at helstone even without her telling us
she looks quite pale and white when she is ill and now she has a bright healthy colour in her cheeks just as she used to have when i first knew her  but papa said margaret with hesitation do you know i think that is the flush of pain  nonsense margaret
i tell you you are too fanciful
you are the person not well i think
send for the doctor tomorrow for yourself and then if it will make your mind easier he can see your mother  thank you dear papa
it will make me happier indeed and she went up to him to kiss him
but he pushed her awaygently enough but still as if she had suggested unpleasant ideas which he should be glad to get rid of as readily as he could of her presence
he walked uneasily up and down the room
poor maria said he half soliloquising i wish one could do right without sacrificing others
i shall hate this town and myself too if she
pray margaret does your mother often talk to you of the old places of helstone i mean  no papa said margaret sadly
then you see she cant be fretting after them eh
it has always been a comfort to me to think that your mother was so simple and open that i knew every little grievance she had
she never would conceal anything seriously affecting her health from me would she eh margaret
i am quite sure she would not
so dont let me hear of these foolish morbid ideas
come give me a kiss and run off to bed  but she heard him pacing about racooning as she and edith used to call it long after her slow and languid undressing was finishedlong after as she began to listen as she lay in bed
the meeting
i was used     to sleep at nights as sweetly as a child     now if the wind blew rough it made me start     and think of my poor boy tossing about     upon the roaring seas
and then i seemed     to feel that it was hard to take him from me     for such a little fault                       southey
it was a comfort to margaret about this time to find that her mother drew more tenderly and intimately towards her than she had ever done since the days of her childhood
she took her to her heart as a confidential friendthe post margaret had always longed to fill and had envied dixon for being preferred to
margaret took pains to respond to every call made upon her for sympathyand they were manyeven when they bore relation to trifles which she would no more have noticed or regarded herself than the elephant would perceive the little pin at his feet which yet he lifts carefully up at the bidding of his keeper
all unconsciously margaret drew near to a reward
one evening mr hale being absent her mother began to talk to her about her brother frederick the very subject on which margaret had longed to ask questions and almost the only one on which her timidity overcame her natural openness
the more she wanted to hear about him the less likely she was to speak
oh margaret it was so windy last night
it came howling down the chimney in our room
i could not sleep
i never can when there is such a terrible wind
i got into a wakeful habit when poor frederick was at sea and now even if i dont waken all at once i dream of him in some stormy sea with great clear glassgreen walls of waves on either side his ship but far higher than her very masts curling over her with that cruel terrible white foam like some gigantic crested serpent
it is an old dream but it always comes back on windy nights till i am thankful to waken sitting straight and stiff up in bed with my terror
poor frederick
he is on land now so wind can do him no harm
though i did think it might shake down some of those tall chimneys  where is frederick now mamma
our letters are directed to the care of messrs barbour at cadiz
i know but where is he himself  i cant remember the name of the place but he is not called hale you must remember that margaret
notice the f d in every corner of the letters
he has taken the name of dickenson
i wanted him to have been called beresford to which he had a kind of right but your father thought he had better not
he might be recognised you know if he were called by my name  mamma said margaret i was at aunt shaws when it all happened and i suppose i was not old enough to be told plainly about it
but i should like to know now if i mayif it does not give you too much pain to speak about it  pain
no replied mrs hale her cheek flushing
yet it is pain to think that perhaps i may never see my darling boy again
or else he did right margaret
they may say what they like but i have his own letters to show and ill believe him though he is my son sooner than any courtmartial on earth
go to my little japan cabinet dear and in the second lefthand drawer you will find a packet of letters  margaret went
there were the yellow seastained letters with the peculiar fragrance which ocean letters have
margaret carried them back to her mother who untied the silken string with trembling fingers and examining their dates she gave them to margaret to read making her hurried anxious remarks on their contents almost before her daughter could have understood what they were
you see margaret how from the very first he disliked captain reid
he was second lieutenant in the shipthe orionin which frederick sailed the very first time
poor little fellow how well he looked in his midshipmans dress with his dirk in his hand cutting open all the newspapers with it as if it were a paperknife
but this mr reid as he was then seemed to take a dislike to frederick from the very beginning
and thenstay
these are the letters he wrote on board the russell
when he was appointed to her and found his old enemy captain reid in command he did mean to bear all his tyranny patiently
look
this is the letter
just read it margaret
where is it he saysstopmy father may rely upon me that i will bear with all proper patience everything that one officer and gentleman can take from another
but from my former knowledge of my present captain i confess i look forward with apprehension to a long course of tyranny on board the russell you see he promises to bear patiently and i am sure he did for he was the sweetesttempered boy when he was not vexed that could possibly be
is that the letter in which he speaks of captain reids impatience with the men for not going through the ships manuvres as quickly as the avenger
you see he says that they had many new hands on board the russell while the avenger had been nearly three years on the station with nothing to do but to keep slavers off and work her men till they ran up and down the rigging like rats or monkeys  margaret slowly read the letter half illegible through the fading of the ink
it might beit probably wasa statement of captain reids imperiousness in trifles very much exaggerated by the narrator who had written it while fresh and warm from the scene of altercation
some sailors being aloft in the maintopsail rigging the captain had ordered them to race down threatening the hindmost with the catofnine tails
he who was the farthest on the spar feeling the impossibility of passing his companions and yet passionately dreading the disgrace of the flogging threw himself desperately down to catch a rope considerably lower failed and fell senseless on the deck
he only survived for a few hours afterwards and the indignation of the ships crew was at boiling point when young hale wrote
but we did not receive this letter till long long after we heard of the mutiny
poor fred
i dare say it was a comfort to him to write it even though he could not have known how to send it poor fellow
and then we saw a report in the papersthats to say long before freds letter reached usof an atrocious mutiny having broken out on board the russell and that the mutineers had remained in possession of the ship which had gone off it was supposed to be a pirate and that captain reid was sent adrift in a boat with some menofficers or somethingwhose names were all given for they were picked up by a west indian steamer
oh margaret
how your father and i turned sick over that list when there was no name of frederick hale
we thought it must be some mistake for poor fred was such a fine fellow only perhaps rather too passionate and we hoped that the name of carr which was in the list was a misprint for that of halenewspapers are so careless
and towards posttime the next day papa set off to walk to southampton to get the papers and i could not stop at home so i went to meet him
he was very latemuch later than i thought he would have been and i sat down under the hedge to wait for him
he came at last his arms hanging loose down his head sunk and walking heavily along as if every step was a labour and a trouble
margaret i see him now  dont go on mamma
i can understand it all said margaret leaning up caressingly against her mothers side and kissing her hand
no you cant margaret
no one can who did not see him then
i could hardly lift myself up to go and meet himeverything seemed so to reel around me all at once
and when i got to him he did not speak or seem surprised to see me there more than three miles from home beside the oldham beechtree but he put my arm in his and kept stroking my hand as if he wanted to soothe me to be very quiet under some great heavy blow and when i trembled so all over that i could not speak he took me in his arms and stooped down his head on mine and began to shake and to cry in a strange muffled groaning voice till i for very fright stood quite still and only begging him to tell me what he had heard
and then with his hand jerking as if some one else moved it against his will he gave me a wicked newspaper to read calling our frederick a traitor of the blackest dye a base ungrateful disgrace to his profession oh
i cannot tell what bad words they did not use
i took the paper in my hands as soon as i had read iti tore it up to little bitsi tore itoh
i believe margaret i tore it with my teeth
i did not cry
i could not
my cheeks were as hot as fire and my very eyes burnt in my head
i saw your father looking grave at me
i said it was a lie and so it was
months after this letter came and you see what provocation frederick had
it was not for himself or his own injuries he rebelled but he would speak his mind to captain reid and so it went on from bad to worse and you see most of the sailors stuck by frederick  i think margaret she continued after a pause in a weak trembling exhausted voice i am glad of iti am prouder of frederick standing up against injustice than if he had been simply a good officer  i am sure i am said margaret in a firm decided tone
loyalty and obedience to wisdom and justice are fine but it is still finer to defy arbitrary power unjustly and cruelly usednot on behalf of ourselves but on behalf of others more helpless  for all that i wish i could see frederick once morejust once
he was my first baby margaret mrs hale spoke wistfully and almost as if apologising for the yearning craving wish as though it were a depreciation of her remaining child
but such an idea never crossed margarets mind
she was thinking how her mothers desire could be fulfilled
it is six or seven years agowould they still prosecute him mother
if he came and stood his trial what would be the punishment
surely he might bring evidence of his great provocation  it would do no good replied mrs hale
some of the sailors who accompanied frederick were taken and there was a courtmartial held on them on board the amicia i believed all they said in their defence poor fellows because it just agreed with fredericks storybut it was of no use and for the first time during the conversation mrs hale began to cry yet something possessed margaret to force the information she foresaw yet dreaded from her mother
what happened to them mamma asked she
they were hung at the yardarm said mrs hale solemnly
and the worst was that the court in condemning them to death said they had suffered themselves to be led astray from their duty by their superior officers  they were silent for a long time
and frederick was in south america for several years was he not  yes
and now he is in spain
at cadiz or somewhere near it
if he comes to england he will be hung
i shall never see his face againfor if he comes to england he will be hung  there was no comfort to be given
mrs hale turned her face to the wall and lay perfectly still in her mothers despair
nothing could be said to console her
she took her hand out of margarets with a little impatient movement as if she would fain be left alone with the recollection of her son
when mr hale came in margaret went out oppressed with gloom and seeing no promise of brightness on any side of the horizon
masters and men
thought fights with thought out springs a spark of truth     from the collision of the sword and shield               w s landor
margaret said her father the next day we must return mrs thorntons call
your mother is not very well and thinks she cannot walk so far but you and i will go this afternoon  as they went mr hale began about his wifes health with a kind of veiled anxiety which margaret was glad to see awakened at last
did you consult the doctor margaret
did you send for him  no papa you spoke of his coming to see me
now i was well
but if i only knew of some good doctor i would go this afternoon and ask him to come for i am sure mamma is seriously indisposed  she put the truth thus plainly and strongly because her father had so completely shut his mind against the idea when she had last named her fears
but now the case was changed
he answered in a despondent tone  do you think she has any hidden complaint
do you think she is really very ill
has dixon said anything
oh margaret
i am haunted by the fear that our coming to milton has killed her
my poor maria  oh papa
dont imagine such things said margaret shocked
she is not well that is all
many a one is not well for a time and with good advice gets better and stronger than ever  but has dixon said anything about her  no
you know dixon enjoys making a mystery out of trifles and she has been a little mysterious about mammas health which has alarmed me rather that is all
without any reason i dare say
you know papa you said the other day i was getting fanciful  i hope and trust you are
but dont think of what i said then
i like you to be fanciful about your mothers health
dont be afraid of telling me your fancies
i like to hear them though i dare say i spoke as if i was annoyed
but we will ask mrs thornton if she can tell us of a good doctor
we wont throw away our money on any but some one firstrate
stay we turn up this street  the street did not look as if it could contain any house large enough for mrs thorntons habitation
her sons presence never gave any impression as to the kind of house he lived in but unconsciously margaret had imagined that tall massive handsomely dressed mrs thornton must live in a house of the same character as herself
now marlborough street consisted of long rows of small houses with a blank wall here and there at least that was all they could see from the point at which they entered it
he told me he lived in marlborough street im sure said mr hale with a much perplexed air
perhaps it is one of the economies he still practises to live in a very small house
but here are plenty of people about let me ask  she accordingly inquired of a passerby and was informed that mr thornton lived close to the mill and had the factory lodgedoor pointed out to her at the end of the long dead wall they had noticed
the lodgedoor was like a common gardendoor on one side of it were great closed gates for the ingress and egress of lorries and wagons
the lodgekeeper admitted them into a great oblong yard on one side of which were offices for the transaction of business on the opposite an immense manywindowed mill whence proceeded the continual clank of machinery and the long groaning roar of the steamengine enough to deafen those who lived within the enclosure
opposite to the wall along which the street ran on one of the narrow sides of the oblong was a handsome stonecoped houseblackened to be sure by the smoke but with paint windows and steps kept scrupulously clean
it was evidently a house which had been built some fifty or sixty years
the stone facingsthe long narrow windows and the number of themthe flights of steps up to the front door ascending from either side and guarded by railingall witnessed to its age
margaret only wondered why people who could afford to live in so good a house and keep it in such perfect order did not prefer a much smaller dwelling in the country or even some suburb not in the continual whirl and din of the factory
her unaccustomed ears could hardly catch her fathers voice as they stood on the steps awaiting the opening of the door
the yard too with the great doors in the dead wall as a boundary was but a dismal lookout for the sittingrooms of the houseas margaret found when they had mounted the oldfashioned stairs and been ushered into the drawingroom the three windows of which went over the front door and the room on the righthand side of the entrance
there was no one in the drawingroom
it seemed as though no one had been in it since the day when the furniture was bagged up with as much care as if the house was to be overwhelmed with lava and discovered a thousand years hence
the walls were pink and gold the pattern on the carpet represented bunches of flowers on a light ground but it was carefully covered up in the centre by a linen drugget glazed and colourless
the windowcurtains were lace each chair and sofa had its own particular veil of netting or knitting
great alabaster groups occupied every flat surface safe from dust under their glass shades
in the middle of the room right under the baggedup chandelier was a large circular table with smartlybound books arranged at regular intervals round the circumference of its polished surface like gaily coloured spokes of a wheel
everything reflected light nothing absorbed it
the whole room had a painfully spotted spangled speckled look about it which impressed margaret so unpleasantly that she was hardly conscious of the peculiar cleanliness required to keep everything so white and pure in such an atmosphere or of the trouble that must be willingly expended to secure that effect of icy snowy discomfort
wherever she looked there was evidence of care and labour but not care and labour to procure ease to help on habits of tranquil home employment solely to ornament and then to preserve ornament from dirt or destruction
they had leisure to observe and to speak to each other in low voices before mrs thornton appeared
they were talking of what all the world might hear but it is a common effect of such a room as this to make people speak low as if unwilling to awaken the unused echoes
at last mrs thornton came in rustling in handsome black silk as was her wont her muslins and laces rivalling not excelling the pure whiteness of the muslins and netting of the room
margaret explained how it was that her mother could not accompany them to return mrs thorntons call but in her anxiety not to bring back her fathers fears too vividly she gave but a bungling account and left the impression on mrs thorntons mind that mrs hales was some temporary or fanciful fineladyish indisposition which might have been put aside had there been a strong enough motive or that if it was too severe to allow her to come out that day the call might have been deferred
remembering too the horses to her carriage hired for her own visit to the hales and how fanny had been ordered to go by mr thornton in order to pay every respect to them mrs thornton drew up slightly offended and gave margaret no sympathyindeed hardly any credit for the statement of her mothers indisposition
how is mr thornton asked mr hale
i was afraid he was not well from his hurried note yesterday  my son is rarely ill and when he is he never speaks about it or makes it an excuse for not doing anything
he told me he could not get leisure to read with you last night sir
he regretted it i am sure he values the hours spent with you  i am sure they are equally agreeable to me said mr hale
it makes me feel young again to see his enjoyment and appreciation of all that is fine in classical literature  i have no doubt that classics are very desirable for people who have leisure
but i confess it was against my judgment that my son renewed his study of them
the time and place in which he lives seem to me to require all his energy and attention
classics may do very well for men who loiter away their lives in the country or in colleges but milton men ought to have their thoughts and powers absorbed in the work of today
at least that is my opinion this last clause she gave out with the pride that apes humility  but surely if the mind is too long directed to one object only it will get stiff and rigid and unable to take in many interests said margaret
i do not quite understand what you mean by a mind getting stiff and rigid
nor do i admire those whirligig characters that are full of this thing today to be utterly forgetful of it in their new interest tomorrow
having many interests does not suit the life of a milton manufacturer
it is or ought to be enough for him to have one great desire and to bring all the purposes of his life to bear on the fulfilment of that  and that is asked mr hale
her sallow cheek flushed and her eye lightened as she answered  to hold and maintain a high honourable place among the merchants of his countrythe men of his town
such a place my son has earned for himself
go where you willi dont say in england only but in europethe name of john thornton of milton is known and respected amongst all men of business
of course it is unknown in the fashionable circles she continued scornfully
idle gentlemen and ladies are not likely to know much of a milton manufacturer unless he gets into parliament or marries a lords daughter  both mr hale and margaret had an uneasy ludicrous consciousness that they had never heard of this great name until mr bell had written them word that mr thornton would be a good friend to have in milton
the proud mothers world was not their world of harley street gentilities on the one hand or country clergymen and hampshire squires on the other
margarets face in spite of all her endeavours to keep it simply listening in its expression told the sensitive mrs thornton this feeling of hers
you think you never heard of this wonderful son of mine miss hale
you think im an old woman whose ideas are hounded by milton and whose own crow is the whitest ever seen  no said margaret with some spirit
it may be true that i was thinking i had hardly heard mr thorntons name before i came to milton
but since i have come here i have heard enough to make me respect and admire him and to feel how much justice and truth there is in what you have said of him  who spoke to you of him asked mrs thornton a little mollified yet jealous lest any one elses words should not have done him full justice
margaret hesitated before she replied
she did not like this authoritative questioning
mr hale came in as he thought to the rescue
it was what mr thornton said himself that made us know the kind of man he was
was it not margaret  mrs thornton drew herself up and said  my son is not the one to tell of his own doings
may i again ask you miss hale from whose account you formed your favourable opinion of him
a mother is curious and greedy of commendation of her children you know  margaret replied it was as much from what mr thornton withheld of that which we had been told of his previous life by mr bellit was more that than what he said that made us all feel what reason you have to be proud of him  mr
bell
what can he know of john
he living a lazy life in a drowsy college
but im obliged to you miss hale
many a missy young lady would have shrunk from giving an old woman the pleasure of hearing that her son was well spoken of  why asked margaret looking straight at mrs thornton in bewilderment
why
because i suppose they might have consciences that told them how surely they were making the old mother into an advocate for them in case they had any plans on the sons heart  she smiled a grim smile for she had been pleased by margarets frankness and perhaps she felt that she had been asking questions too much as if she had a right to catechise
margaret laughed outright at the notion presented to her laughed so merrily that it grated on mrs thorntons ear as if the words that called forth that laugh must have been utterly and entirely ludicrous
margaret stopped her merriment as soon as she saw mrs thorntons annoyed look
i beg your pardon madam
but i really am very much obliged to you for exonerating me from making any plans on mr thorntons heart  young ladies have before now said mrs thornton stiffly
i hope miss thornton is well put in mr hale desirous of changing the current of the conversation
she is as well as she ever is
she is not strong replied mrs thornton shortly
and mr thornton
i suppose i may hope to see him on thursday  i cannot answer for my sons engagements
there is some uncomfortable work going on in the town a threatening of a strike
if so his experience and judgment will make him much consulted by his friends
but i should think he could come on thursday
at any rate i am sure he will let you know if he cannot  a strike asked margaret
what for
what are they going to strike for  for the mastership and ownership of other peoples property said mrs thornton with a fierce snort
that is what they always strike for
if my sons workpeople strike i will only say they are a pack of ungrateful hounds
but i have no doubt they will  they are wanting higher wages i suppose asked mr hale
that is the face of the thing
but the truth is they want to be masters and make the masters into slaves on their own ground
they are always trying at it they always have it in their minds and every five or six years there comes a struggle between masters and men
theyll find themselves mistaken this time i fancya little out of their reckoning
if they turn out they maynt find it so easy to go in again
i believe the masters have a thing or two in their heads which will teach the men not to strike again in a hurry if they try it this time  does it make the town very rough asked margaret
of course it does
but surely you are not a coward are you
milton is not the place for cowards
i have known the time when i have had to thread my way through a crowd of white angry men all swearing they would have makinsons blood as soon as he ventured to show his nose out of his factory and he knowing nothing of it some one had to go and tell him or he was a dead man and it needed to be a womanso i went
and when i got in i could not get out
it was as much as my life was worth
so i went up to the roof where there were stones piled ready to drop on the heads of the crowd if they tried to force the factory doors
and i would have lifted those heavy stones and dropped them with as good an aim as the best man there but that i fainted with the heat i had gone through
if you live in milton you must learn to have a brave heart miss hale  i would do my best said margaret rather pale
i do not know whether i am brave or not till i am tried but i am afraid i should be a coward  south country people are often frightened by what our darkshire men and women only call living and struggling
but when youve been ten years among a people who are always owing their betters a grudge and only waiting for an opportunity to pay it off youll know whether you are a coward or not take my word for it  mr thornton came that evening to mr hales
he was shown up into the drawingroom where mr hale was reading aloud to his wife and daughter
i am come partly to bring you a note from my mother and partly to apologise for not keeping to my time yesterday
the note contains the address you asked for dr donaldson  thank you said margaret hastily holding out her hand to take the note for she did not wish her mother to hear that they had been making any inquiry about a doctor
she was pleased that mr thornton seemed immediately to understand her feeling he gave her the note without another word of explanation
mr hale began to talk about the strike
mr thorntons face assumed a likeness to his mothers worst expression which immediately repelled the watching margaret
yes the fools will have a strike
let them
it suits us well enough
but we gave them a chance
they think trade is flourishing as it was last year
we see the storm on the horizon and draw in our sails
but because we dont explain our reasons they wont believe were acting reasonably
we must give them line and letter for the way we choose to spend or save our money
henderson tried a dodge with his men out at ashley and failed
he rather wanted a strike it would have suited his book well enough
so when the men came to ask for the five per cent
they are claiming he told em hed think about it and give them his answer on the pay day knowing all the while what his answer would be of course but thinking hed strengthen their conceit of their own way
however they were too deep for him and heard something about the bad prospects of trade
so in they came on the friday and drew back their claim and now hes obliged to go on working
but we milton masters have today sent in our decision
we wont advance a penny
we tell them we may have to lower wages but cant afford to raise
so here we stand waiting for their next attack  and what will that be asked mr hale
i conjecture a simultaneous strike
you will see milton without smoke in a few days i imagine miss hale  but why asked she could you not explain what good reason you had for expecting a bad trade
i dont know whether i use the right words but you will understand what i mean  do you give your servants reasons for your expenditure or your economy in the use of your own money
we the owners of capital have a right to choose what we will do with it  a human right said margaret very low
i beg your pardon i did not hear what you said  i would rather not repeat it said she it related to a feeling which i do not think you would share  wont you try me pleaded he his thoughts suddenly bent upon learning what she had said
she was displeased with his pertinacity but did not choose to affix too much importance to her words
i said you had a human right
i meant that there seemed no reason but religious ones why you should not do what you like with your own  i know we differ in our religious opinions but dont you give me credit for having some though not the same as yours  he was speaking in a subdued voice as if to her alone
she did not wish to be so exclusively addressed
she replied out in her usual tone  i do not think that i have any occasion to consider your special religious opinions in the affair
all i meant to say is that there is no human law to prevent the employers from utterly wasting or throwing away all their money if they choose but that there are passages in the bible which would rather implyto me at leastthat they neglected their duties as stewards if they did so
however i know so little about strikes and rate of wages and capital and labour that i had better not talk to a political economist like you  nay the more reason said he eagerly
i shall only be too glad to explain to you all that may seem anomalous or mysterious to a stranger especially at a time like this when our doings are sure to be canvassed by every scribbler who can hold a pen  thank you she answered coldly
of course i shall apply to my father in the first instance for any information he can give me if i get puzzled with living here amongst this strange society  you think it strange
why  i dont knowi suppose because on the very face of it i see two classes dependent on each other in every possible way yet each evidently regarding the interests of the other as opposed to their own i never lived in a place before where there were two sets of people always running each other down  who have you heard running the masters down
i dont ask who you have heard abusing the men for i see you persist in misunderstanding what i said the other day
but who have you heard abusing the masters  margaret reddened then smiled as she said  i am not fond of being catechised
i refuse to answer your question
besides it has nothing to do with the fact
you must take my word for it that i have heard some people or it may be only some one of the workpeople speak as though it were the interest of the employers to keep them from acquiring moneythat it would make them too independent if they had a sum in the savings bank  i dare say it was that man higgins who told you all this said mrs hale
mr thornton did not appear to hear what margaret evidently did not wish him to know
but he caught it nevertheless
i heard moreover that it was considered to the advantage of the masters to have ignorant workmennot hedgelawyers as captain lennox used to call those men in his company who questioned and would know the reason for every order  this latter part of her sentence she addressed rather to her father than to mr thornton
who is captain lennox
asked mr thornton of himself with a strange kind of displeasure that prevented him for the moment from replying to her
her father took up the conversation
you never were fond of schools margaret or you would have seen and known before this how much is being done for education in milton  no she said with sudden meekness
i know i do not care enough about schools
but the knowledge and the ignorance of which i was speaking did not relate to reading and writingthe teaching or information one can give to a child
i am sure that what was meant was ignorance of the wisdom that shall guide men and women
i hardly know what that is
but hethat is my informantspoke as if the masters would like their hands to be merely tall large childrenliving in the present momentwith a blind unreasoning kind of obedience  in short miss hale it is very evident that your informant found a pretty ready listener to all the slander he chose to utter against the masters said mr thornton in an offended tone
margaret did not reply
she was displeased at the personal character mr thornton affixed to what she had said
mr hale spoke next  i must confess that although i have not become so intimately acquainted with any workmen as margaret has i am very much struck by the antagonism between the employer and the employed on the very surface of things
i even gather this impression from what you yourself have from time to time said  mr thornton paused awhile before he spoke
margaret had just left the room and he was vexed at the state of feeling between himself and her
however the little annoyance by making him cooler and more thoughtful gave a greater dignity to what he said  my theory is that my interests are identical with those of my workpeople and viceversa
miss hale i know does not like to hear men called hands so i wont use that word though it comes most readily to my lips as the technical term whose origin whatever it was dates before my time
on some future dayin some millenniumin utopia this unity may be brought into practicejust as i can fancy a republic the most perfect form of government  we will read platos republic as soon as we have finished homer  well in the platonic year it may fall out that we are allmen women and childrenfit for a republic but give me a constitutional monarchy in our present state of morals and intelligence
in our infancy we require a wise despotism to govern us
indeed long past infancy children and young people are the happiest under the unfailing laws of a discreet firm authority
i agree with miss hale so far as to consider our people in the condition of children while i deny that we the masters have anything to do with the making or keeping them so
i maintain that despotism is the best kind of government for them so that in the hours in which i come in contact with them i must necessarily be an autocrat
i will use my best discretionfrom no humbug or philanthropic feeling of which we have had rather too much in the northto make wise laws and come to just decisions in the conduct of my businesslaws and decisions which work for my own good in the first instancefor theirs in the second but i will neither be forced to give my reasons nor flinch from what i have once declared to be my resolution
let them turn out
i shall suffer as well as they but in the end they will find i have not bated nor altered one jot  margaret had reentered the room and was sitting at her work but she did not speak
mr hale answered  i dare say i am talking in great ignorance but from the little i know i should say that the masses were already passing rapidly into the troublesome stage which intervenes between childhood and manhood in the life of the multitude as well as that of the individual
now the error which many parents commit in the treatment of the individual at this time is insisting on the same unreasoning obedience as when all he had to do in the way of duty was to obey the simple laws of come when youre called and do as youre bid but a wise parent humours the desire for independent action so as to become the friend and adviser when his absolute rule shall cease
if i get wrong in my reasoning recollect it is you who adopted the analogy  very lately said margaret i heard a story of what happened in nuremberg only three or four years ago
a rich man there lived alone in one of the immense mansions which were formerly both dwellings and warehouses
it was reported that he had a child but no one knew of it for certain
for forty years this rumour kept rising and fallingnever utterly dying away
after his death it was found to be true
he had a sonan overgrown man with the unexercised intellect of a child whom he had kept up in that strange way in order to save him from temptation and error
but of course when this great old child was turned loose in the world every bad counsellor had power over him
he did not know good from evil
his father had made the blunder of bringing him up in ignorance and taking it for innocence and after fourteen months of riotous living the city authorities had to take charge of him in order to save him from starvation
he could not even use words effectively enough to be a successful beggar  i used the comparison suggested by miss hale of the position of the master to that of a parent so i ought not to complain of your turning the simile into a weapon against me
but mr hale when you were setting up a wise parent as a model for us you said he humoured his children in their desire for independent action
now certainly the time is not come for the hands to have any independent action during business hours i hardly know what you would mean by it then
and i say that the masters would be trenching on the independence of their hands in a way that i for one should not feel justified in doing if we interfered too much with the life they lead out of the mills
because they labour ten hours aday for us i do not see that we have any right to impose leadingstrings upon them for the rest of their time
i value my own independence so highly that i can fancy no degradation greater than that of having another man perpetually directing and advising and lecturing me or even planning too closely in any way about my actions
he might be the wisest of men or the most powerfuli should equally rebel and resent his interference
i imagine this is a stronger feeling in the north of england than in the south  i beg your pardon but is not that because there has been none of the equality of friendship between the adviser and advised classes
because every man has had to stand in an unchristian and isolated position apart from and jealous of his brotherman constantly afraid of his rights being trenched upon  i only state the fact
i am sorry to say i have an appointment at eight oclock and i must just take facts as i find them tonight without trying to account for them which indeed would make no difference in determining how to act as things standthe facts must be granted  but said margaret in a low voice it seems to me that it makes all the difference in the world her father made a sign to her to be silent and allow mr thornton to finish what he had to say
he was already standing up and preparing to go
you must grant me this one point
given a strong feeling of independence in every darkshire man have i any right to obtrude my views of the manner in which he shall act upon another hating it as i should do most vehemently myself merely because he has labour to sell and i capital to buy  not in the least said margaret determined to say just this one thing not in the least because of your labour and capital positions whatever they are but because you are a man dealing with a set of men over whom you have whether you reject the use of it or not immense power just because your lives and your welfare are so constantly and intimately interwoven
god has made us so that we must be mutually dependent
we may ignore our own dependence or refuse to acknowledge that others depend upon us in more respects than the payment of weekly wages but the thing must be nevertheless
neither you nor any other master can help yourselves
the most proudly independent man depends on those around him for their insensible influence on his characterhis life
and the most isolated of all your darkshire egos has dependants clinging to him on all sides he cannot shake them off any more than the great rock he resembles can shake off  pray dont go into similes margaret you have led us off once already said her father smiling yet uneasy at the thought that they were detaining mr thornton against his will which was a mistake for he rather liked it as long as margaret would talk although what she said only irritated him
just tell me miss hale are you yourself ever influencedno that is not a fair way of putting itbut if you are ever conscious of being influenced by others and not by circumstances have those others been working directly or indirectly
have they been labouring to exhort to enjoin to act rightly for the sake of example or have they been simple true men taking up their duty and doing it unflinchingly without a thought of how their actions were to make this man industrious that man saving
why if i were a workman i should be twenty times more impressed by the knowledge that my master was honest punctual quick resolute in all his doings and hands are keener spies even than valets than by any amount of interference however kindly meant with my ways of going on out of workhours
i do not choose to think too closely on what i am myself but i believe i rely on the straightforward honesty of my hands and the open nature of their opposition in contradistinction to the way in which the turnout will be managed in some mills just because they know i scorn to take a single dishonourable advantage or do an underhand thing myself
it goes farther than a whole course of lectures on honesty is the best policylife diluted into words
no no
what the master is that will the men be without overmuch taking thought on his part  that is a great admission said margaret laughing
when i see men violent and obstinate in pursuit of their rights i may safely infer that the master is the same that he is a little ignorant of that spirit which suffereth long and is kind and seeketh not her own  you are just like all strangers who dont understand the working of our system miss hale said he hastily
you suppose that our men are puppets of dough ready to be moulded into any amiable form we please
you forget we have only to do with them for less than a third of their lives and you seem not to perceive that the duties of a manufacturer are far larger and wider than those merely of an employer of labour we have a wide commercial character to maintain which makes us into the great pioneers of civilisation  it strikes me said mr hale smiling that you might pioneer a little at home
they are a rough heathenish set of fellows these milton men of yours  they are that replied mr thornton
rosewater surgery wont do for them
cromwell would have made a capital millowner miss hale
i wish we had him to put down this strike for us  cromwell is no hero of mine she said coldly
but i am trying to reconcile your admiration of despotism with your respect for other mens independence of character  he reddened at her tone
i choose to be the unquestioned and irresponsible master of my hands during the hours they labour for me
but those hours past our relation ceases and then comes in the same respect for their independence that i myself exact  he did not speak again for a minute he was too much vexed
but he shook it off and bade mr and mrs hale good night
then drawing near to margaret he said in a lower voice  i spoke hastily to you once this evening and i am afraid rather rudely
but you know i am but an uncouth milton manufacturer will you forgive me  certainly said she smiling up in his face the expression of which was somewhat anxious and oppressed and hardly cleared away as he met her sweet sunny countenance out of which all the northwind effect of their discussion had entirely vanished
but she did not put out her hand to him and again he felt the omission and set it down to pride
the shadow of death
trust in that veiled hand which leads     none by the path that he would go     and always be for change prepared     for the worlds law is ebb and flow               from the arabic
the next afternoon dr donaldson came to pay his first visit to mrs hale
the mystery that margaret hoped their late habits of intimacy had broken through was resumed
she was excluded from the room while dixon was admitted
margaret was not a ready lover but where she loved she loved passionately and with no small degree of jealousy
she went into her mothers bedroom just behind the drawingroom and paced it up and down while awaiting the doctors coming out
every now and then she stopped to listen she fancied she heard a moan
she clenched her hands tight and held her breath
she was sure she heard a moan
then all was still for a few minutes more and then there was the moving of chairs the raised voices all the little disturbances of leavetaking
when she heard the door open she went quickly out of the bedroom
my father is from home dr donaldson he has to attend a pupil at this hour
may i trouble you to come into his room downstairs  she saw and triumphed over all the obstacles which dixon threw in her way assuming her rightful position as daughter of the house in something of the spirit of the elder brother which quelled the old servants officiousness very effectually
margarets conscious assumption of this unusual dignity of demeanour towards dixon gave her an instants amusement in the midst of her anxiety
she knew from the surprised expression on dixons face how ridiculously grand she herself must be looking and the idea carried her downstairs into the room it gave her that length of oblivion from the keen sharpness of the recollection of the actual business in hand
now that came back and seemed to take away her breath
it was a moment or two before she could utter a word
but she spoke with an air of command as she asked  what is the matter with mamma
you will oblige me by telling the simple truth then seeing a slight hesitation on the doctors part she added  i am the only child she hashere i mean
my father is not sufficiently alarmed i fear and therefore if there is any serious apprehension it must be broken to him gently
i can do this
i can nurse my mother
pray speak sir to see your face and not be able to read it gives me a worse dread than i trust any words of yours will justify  my dear young lady your mother seems to have a most attentive and efficient servant who is more like her friend  i am her daughter sir  but when i tell you she expressly desired that you might not be told  i am not good or patient enough to submit to the prohibition
besides i am sure you are too wisetoo experienced to have promised to keep the secret  well said he halfsmiling though sadly enough there you are right
i did not promise
in fact i fear the secret will be known soon enough without my revealing it  he paused
margaret then went very white and compressed her lips a little more
otherwise not a feature moved
with the quick insight into character without which no medical man can rise to the eminence of dr donaldson he saw that she would exact the full truth that she would know if one iota was withheld and that the withholding would be torture more acute than the knowledge of it
he spoke two short sentences in a low voice watching her all the time for the pupils of her eyes dilated into a black horror and the whiteness of her complexion became livid
he ceased speaking
he waited for that look to go offfor her gasping breath to come
then she said  i thank you most truly sir for your confidence
that dread has haunted me for many weeks
it is a true real agony
my poor poor mother her lips now began to quiver and he let her have the relief of tears sure of her power of selfcontrol to check them
a few tearsthose were all she shed before she recollected the many questions she longed to ask
will there be much suffering  he shook his head
that we cannot tell
it depends on constitution on a thousand things
but the late discoveries of medical science have given us large power of alleviation  my father said margaret trembling all over
i do not know mr hale
i mean it is difficult to give advice
but i should say bear on with the knowledge you have forced me to give you so abruptly till the fact which i could not withhold has become in some degree familiar to you so that you may without too great an effort be able to give what comfort you can to your father
before thenmy visits which of course i shall repeat from time to time although i fear i can do nothing but alleviatea thousand little circumstances will have occurred to awaken his alarm to deepen itso that he will be all the better preparednay my dear young ladynay my deari saw mr thornton and i honour your father for the sacrifice he has made however mistaken i may believe him to bewell this once if it will please you my dear
only remember when i come again i come as a friend
and you must learn to look upon me as such because seeing each othergetting to know each other at such times as these is worth years of morning calls  margaret could not speak for crying but she wrang his hand at parting
thats what i call a fine girl thought dr donaldson when he was seated in his carriage and had time to examine his ringed hand which had slightly suffered from her pressure
who would have thought that little hand could have given such a squeeze
but the bones were well put together and that gives immense power
what a queen she is
with her head thrown back at first to force me into speaking the truth and then bent so eagerly forward to listen
poor thing
i must see she does not overstrain herself
though its astonishing how much these thoroughbred creatures can do and suffer
that girls game to the backbone
another who had gone that deadly colour could never have come round without either fainting or hysterics
but she wouldnt do eithernot she
and the very force of her will brought her round
such a girl as that would win my heart if i were thirty years younger
its too late now
ah here we are at the archers so out he jumped with thought wisdom experience sympathy and ready to attend to any of the calls made upon them by this family just as if there were none other in the world
meanwhile margaret had returned into her fathers study for a moment to recover strength before going upstairs into her mothers presence
oh my god my god
but this is terrible
how shall i bear it
such a deadly disease
no hope
oh mamma mamma i wish i had never gone to aunt shaws and been all those precious years away from you
poor mamma
how much she must have borne
oh pray thee my god that her sufferings may not be too acute too dreadful
how shall i bear to see them
how can i bear papas agony
he must not be told yet not all at once
it would kill him
but i wont lose another moment of my own dear precious mother  she ran upstairs
dixon was not in the room
mrs hale lay back in an easy chair with a soft white shawl wrapped around her and a becoming cap put on in expectation of the doctors visit
her face had a little faint colour in it and the very exhaustion after the examination gave it a peaceful look
margaret was surprised to see her look so calm
why margaret how strange you look
what is the matter and then as the idea stole into her mind of what was indeed the real state of the case she added as if a little displeased you have not been seeing dr donaldson and asking him any questionshave you child margaret did not replyonly looked wistfully towards her
mrs hale became more displeased
he would not surely break his word to me and  oh yes mamma he did
i made him
it was iblame me she knelt down by her mothers side and caught her handshe would not let it go though mrs hale tried to pull it away
she kept kissing it and the hot tears she shed bathed it
margaret it was very wrong of you
you knew i did not wish you to know but as if tired with the contest she left her hand in margarets clasp and byandby she returned the pressure faintly
that encouraged margaret to speak
oh mamma
let me be your nurse
i will learn anything dixon can teach me
but you know i am your child and i do think i have a right to do everything for you  you dont know what you are asking said mrs hale with a shudder
yes i do
i know a great deal more than you are aware of
let me be your nurse
let me try at any rate
no one has ever shall ever try so hard as i will do
it will be such a comfort mamma  my poor child
well you shall try
do you know margaret dixon and i thought you would quite shrink from me if you knew  dixon thought said margaret her lip curling
dixon could not give me credit for enough true lovefor as much as herself
she thought i suppose that i was one of those poor sickly women who like to lie on rose leaves and be fanned all day
dont let dixons fancies come any more between you and me mamma
dont please implored she
dont be angry with dixon said mrs hale anxiously
margaret recovered herself
no
i wont
i will try and be humble and learn her ways if you will only let me do all i can for you
let me be in the first place motheri am greedy of that
i used to fancy you would forget me while i was away at aunt shaws and cry myself to sleep at nights with that notion in my head  and i used to think how will margaret bear our makeshift poverty after the thorough comfort and luxury in harley street till i have many a time been more ashamed of your seeing our contrivances at helstone than of any stranger finding them out  oh mamma
and i did so enjoy them
they were so much more amusing than all the jogtrot harley street ways
the wardrobe shelf with handles that served as a suppertray on grand occasions
and the old teachests stuffed and covered for ottomans
i think what you call the makeshift contrivances at dear helstone were a charming part of the life there  i shall never see helstone again margaret said mrs hale the tears welling up into her eyes
margaret could not reply
mrs hale went on
while i was there i was for ever wanting to leave it
every place seemed pleasanter
and now i shall die far away from it
i am rightly punished  you must not talk so said margaret impatiently
he said you might live for years
oh mother
we will have you back at helstone yet  no never
that i must take as a just penance
but margaretfrederick  at the mention of that one word she suddenly cried out loud as in some sharp agony
it seemed as if the thought of him upset all her composure destroyed the calm overcame the exhaustion
wild passionate cry succeeded to cryfrederick
frederick
come to me
i am dying
little firstborn child come to me once again  she was in violent hysterics
margaret went and called dixon in terror
dixon came in a huff and accused margaret of having overexcited her mother
margaret bore all meekly only trusting that her father might not return
in spite of her alarm which was even greater than the occasion warranted she obeyed all dixons directions promptly and well without a word of selfjustification
by so doing she mollified her accuser
they put her mother to bed and margaret sate by her till she fell asleep and afterwards till dixon beckoned her out of the room and with a sour face as if doing something against the grain she bade her drink a cup of coffee which she had prepared for her in the drawingroom and stood over her in a commanding attitude as she did so
you shouldnt have been so curious miss and then you wouldnt have needed to fret before your time
it would have come soon enough
and now i suppose youll tell master and a pretty household i shall have of you  no dixon said margaret sorrowfully i will not tell papa
he could not bear it as i can and by way of proving how well she bore it she burst into tears
ay
i knew how it would be
now youll waken your mamma just after shes gone to sleep so quietly
miss margaret my dear ive had to keep it down this many a week and though i dont pretend i can love her as you do yet i loved her better than any other man woman or childno one but master frederick ever came near her in my mind
ever since lady beresfords maid first took me in to see her dressed out in white crape and cornears and scarlet poppies and i ran a needle down into my finger and broke it in and she tore up her worked pockethandkerchief after theyd cut it out and came in to wet the bandages again with lotion when she returned from the ballwhere shed been the prettiest young lady of allive never loved any one like her
i little thought then that i should live to see her brought so low
i dont mean no reproach to nobody
many a one calls you pretty and handsome and what not
even in this smoky place enough to blind ones eyes the owls can see that
but youll never be like your mother for beautynever not if you live to be a hundred  mamma is very pretty still
poor mamma  now dont ye set off again or i shall give way at last whimpering
youll never stand masters coming home and questioning at this rate
go out and take a walk and come in something like
manys the time ive longed to walk it offthe thought of what was the matter with her and how it must all end  oh dixon said margaret how often ive been cross with you not knowing what a terrible secret you had to bear  bless you child
i like to see you showing a bit of a spirit
its the good old beresford blood
why the last sir john but two shot his steward down there where he stood for just telling him that he racked the tenants and hed racked the tenants till he could get no more money off them than he could get skin off a flint  well dixon i wont shoot you and ill try not to be cross again  you never have
if ive said it at times it has always been to myself just in private by way of making a little agreeable conversation for theres no one here fit to talk to
and when you fire up youre the very image of master frederick
i could find in my heart to put you in a passion any day just to see his stormy look coming like a great cloud over your face
but now you go out miss
ill watch over missus and as for master his books are company enough for him if he should come in  i will go said margaret
she hung about dixon for a minute or so as if afraid and irresolute then suddenly kissing her she went quickly out of the room
bless her said dixon
shes as sweet as a nut
there are three people i love its missus master frederick and her
just them three
thats all
the rest be hanged for i dont know what theyre in the world for
master was born i suppose for to marry missus
if i thought he loved her properly i might get to love him in time
but he should ha made a deal more on her and not been always reading reading thinking thinking
see what it has brought him to
many a one who never reads or thinks either gets to be rector and dean and what not and i daresay master might if hed just minded missus and let the weary reading and thinking alonethere she goes looking out of the window as she heard the front door shut
poor young lady
her clothes look shabby to what they did when she came to helstone a year ago
then she hadnt so much as a darned stocking or a cleaned pair of gloves in all her wardrobe
and now      what is a strike
there are briars besetting every path       which call for patient care     there is a cross in every lot       and an earnest need for prayer               anon
margaret went out heavily and unwillingly enough
but the length of a streetyes the air of a milton streetcheered her young blood before she reached her first turning
her step grew lighter her lip redder
she began to take notice instead of having her thoughts turned so exclusively inward
she saw unusual loiterers in the streets men with their hands in their pockets sauntering along loudlaughing and loudspoken girls clustered together apparently excited to high spirits and a boisterous independence of temper and behaviour
the more illlooking of the menthe discreditable minorityhung about on the steps of the beerhouses and ginshops smoking and commenting pretty freely on every passerby
margaret disliked the prospect of the long walk through these streets before she came to the fields which she had planned to reach
instead she would go and see bessy higgins
it would not be so refreshing as a quiet country walk but still it would perhaps be doing the kinder thing
nicholas higgins was sitting by the fire smoking as she went in
bessy was rocking herself on the other side
nicholas took the pipe out of his mouth and standing up pushed his chair towards margaret he leant against the chimneypiece in a lounging attitude while she asked bessy how she was
hoos rather down i th mouth in regard to spirits but hoos better in health
hoo doesnt like this strike
hoos a deal too much set on piece and quietness at any price  this is th third strike ive seen said she sighing as if that was answer and explanation enough
well third time pays for all
see if we dont dang th masters this time
see if they dont come and beg us to come back at our own price
thats all
weve missed it afore time i grant yo but this time wen laid our plans desperate deep  why do you strike asked margaret
striking is leaving off work till you get your own rate of wages is it not
you must not wonder at my ignorance where i come from i never heard of a strike  i wish i were there said bessie wearily
but its not for me to get sick and tired o strikes
this is the last ill see
before its ended i shall be in the great citythe holy jerusalem  hoos so full of th life to come hoo cannot think of th present
now i yo see am bound to do the best i can here
i think a bird i th hand is worth two i th bush
so thems the different views we take on th strike question  but said margaret if the people struck as you call it where i come from as they are mostly all field labourers the seed would not be sown the hay got in the corn reaped  well said he
he had resumed his pipe and put his well in the form of an interrogation
why she went on what would become of the farmers  he puffed away
i reckon theyd have either to give up their farms or to give fair rate of wage  suppose they could not or would not do the last they could not give up their farms all in a minute however much they might wish to do so but they would have no hay nor corn to sell that year and where would the money come from to pay the labourers wages the next  still puffing away
at last he said  i know nought of your ways down south
i have heerd theyre a pack of spiritless downtrodden men welly clemmed to death too dazed wi clemming to know when theyre put upon
now its not so here
we known when were put upon and ween too much blood in us to stand it
we just take our hands fro our looms and say yo may clem us but yoll not put upon us my masters and be danged to em they shant this time  i wished i lived down south said bessy
theres a deal to bear there said margaret
there are sorrows to bear everywhere
there is very hard bodily labour to be gone through with very little food to give strength  but its out of doors said bessy
and away from the endless endless noise and sickening heat  its sometimes in heavy rain and sometimes in bitter cold
a young person can stand it but an old man gets racked with rheumatism and bent and withered before his time yet he must just work on the same or else go to the workhouse  i thought yo were so taken wi the ways of the south country  so i am said margaret smiling a little as she found herself thus caught
i only mean bessy theres good and bad in everything in this world and as you felt the bad up here i thought it was but fair you should know the bad down there  and yo say they never strike down there asked nicholas abruptly
no said margaret i think they have too much sense  an i think replied he dashing the ashes out of his pipe with so much vehemence that it broke its not that theyve too much sense but that theyve too little spirit  oh father said bessy what have ye gained by striking
just think of that first strike when mother diedhow we all had to clemyou the worst of all and yet many a one went in every week at the same wage till all were gone in that there was work for and some went beggars all their lives at after  ay said he
that there strike was badly managed
folk got into th management of it as were either fools or not true men
yoll see itll be different this time  but all this time youve not told me what youre striking for said margaret again
why yo see theres five or six masters who have set themselves again paying the wages theyve been paying these two years past and flourishing upon and getting richer upon
and now they come to us and say were to take less
and we wont
well just clem them to death first and see wholl work for em then
theyll have killed the goose that laid em the golden eggs i reckon  and so you plan dying in order to be revenged upon them  no said he i dunnot
i just look forward to the chance of dying at my post sooner than yield
thats what folk call fine and honourable in a soldier and why not in a poor weaverchap  but said margaret a soldier dies in the cause of the nationin the cause of others  he laughed grimly
my lass said he yore but a young wench but dont yo think i can keep three peoplethats bessy and mary and meon sixteen shillings a week
dun yo think its for mysel im striking work at this time
it is just as much in the cause of others as yon soldieronly mappen the cause he dies for is just that of somebody he never clapt eyes on nor heerd on all his born days while i take up john bouchers cause as lives next door but one wi a sickly wife and eight childer none on em factory age and i dont take up his cause only though hes a poor goodfornought as can only manage two looms at a time but i take up th cause o justice
why are we to have less wage now i ask than two year ago  dont ask me said margaret i am very ignorant
ask some of your masters
surely they will give you a reason for it
it is not merely an arbitrary decision of theirs come to without reason  yore just a foreigner and nothing more said he contemptuously
much yo know about it
ask th masters
theyd tell us to mind our own business and theyd mind theirs
our business being yo understand to take the bated wage and be thankful and their business to bate us down to clemming point to swell their profits
thats what it is  but said margaret determined not to give way although she saw she was irritating him the state of trade may be such as not to enable them to give you the same remuneration  state o trade
thats just a piece o masters humbug
its rate o wages i was talking of
th masters keep th state o trade in their own hands and just walk it forward like a black bugaboo to frighten naughty children with into being good
ill tell you its their parttheir cue as some folks call itto beat us down to swell their fortunes and its ours to stand up and fight hardnot for ourselves alone but for them round about usfor justice and fair play
we help to make their profits and we ought to help spend em
its not that we want their brass so much this time as weve done many a time afore
wen getten money laid by and were resolved to stand and fall together not a man on us will go in for less wage than th union says is our due
so i say hooray for the strike and let thornton and slickson and hamper and their set look to it  thornton said margaret
mr
thornton of marlborough street  aye
thornton o marlborough mill as we call him  he is one of the masters you are striving with is he not
what sort of a master is he  did yo ever see a bulldog
set a bulldog on hind legs and dress him up in coat and breeches and yon just getten john thornton  nay said margaret laughing i deny that
mr thornton is plain enough but hes not like a bulldog with its short broad nose and snarling upper lip  no
not in look i grant yo
but let john thornton get hold on a notion and hell stick to it like a bulldog yo might pull him away wi a pitchfork ere hed leave go
hes worth fighting wi is john thornton
as for slickson i take it some o these days hell wheedle his men back wi fair promises that theyll just get cheated out of as soon as theyre in his power again
hell work his fines well out on em ill warrant
hes as slippery as an eel he is
hes like a catas sleek and cunning and fierce
itll never be an honest up and down fight wi him as it will be wi thornton
thorntons as dour as a doornail an obstinate chap every inch on himth oud bulldog  poor bessy said margaret turning round to her
you sigh over it all
you dont like struggling and fighting as your father does do you  no said she heavily
im sick on it
i could have wished to have had other talk about me in my latter days than just the clashing and clanging and clattering that has ever wearied a my life long about work and wages and masters and hands and knobsticks
poor wench
latter days be farred
thourt looking a sight better already for a little stir and change
beside i shall be a deal here to make it more lively for thee  tobaccosmoke chokes me said she querulously
then ill never smoke no more i the house he replied tenderly
but why didst thou not tell me afore thou foolish wench  she did not speak for a while and then so low that only margaret heard her  i reckon hell want a the comfort he can get out o either pipe or drink afore hes done  her father went out of doors evidently to finish his pipe
bessy said passionately  now am not i a foolam i not missthere i knew i ought for to keep father at home and away fro the folk that are always ready for to tempt a man in time o strike to go drinkand there my tongue must needs quarrel with this pipe o hisnand hell go off i know he willas often as he wants to smokeand nobody knows where itll end
i wish id letten myself be choked first  but does your father drink said margaret
nonot to say drink replied she still in the same wild excited tone
but what win ye have
there are days wi you as wi other folk i suppose when yo get up and go through th hours just longing for a bit of a changea bit of a fillip as it were
i know i ha gone and bought a fourpounder out o another bakers shop to common on such days just because i sickened at the thought of going on for ever wi the same sight in my eyes and the same sound in my ears and the same taste i my mouth and the same thought or no thought for that matter in my head day after day for ever
ive longed for to be a man to go spreeing even if it were only a tramp to some new place in search o work
and fatherall menhave it stronger in em than me to get tired o sameness and work for ever
and what is em to do
its little blame to them if they do go into th ginshop for to make their blood flow quicker and more lively and see things they never see at no other timepictures and lookingglass and such like
but father never was a drunkard though maybe hes got worse for drink now and then
only yo see and now her voice took a mournful pleading tone at times o strike theres much to knock a man down for all they start so hopefully and wheres the comfort to come fro
hell get angry and madthey all doand then they get tired out wi being angry and mad and maybe ha done things in their passion theyd be glad to forget
bless yor sweet pitiful face
but yo dunnot know what a strike is yet  come bessy said margaret i wont say youre exaggerating because i dont know enough about it but perhaps as youre not well youre only looking on one side and there is another and a brighter to be looked to  its all well enough for yo to say so who have lived in pleasant green places all your life long and never known want or care or wickedness either for that matter  take care said margaret her cheek flushing and her eye lightening how you judge bessy
i shall go home to my mother who is so illso ill bessy that theres no outlet but death for her out of prison of her great suffering and yet i must speak cheerfully to my father who has no notion of her real state and to whom the knowledge must come gradually
the only personthe only one who could sympathise with me and help mewhose presence could comfort my mother more than any other earthly thingis falsely accusedwould run the risk of death if he came to see his dying mother
this i tell youonly you bessy
you must not mention it
no other person in miltonhardly any other person in england knows
have i not care
do i not know anxiety though i go about welldressed and have food enough
oh bessy god is just and our lots are well portioned out by him although none but he knows the bitterness of our souls  i ask your pardon replied bessy humbly
sometimes when ive thought o my life and the little pleasure ive had in it ive believed that maybe i was one of those doomed to die by the falling of a star from heaven and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and men died of the waters because they were made bitter one can bear pain and sorrow better if one thinks it has been prophesied long before for one somehow then it seems as if my pain was needed for the fulfilment otherways it seems all sent for nothing  nay bessythink said margaret
god does not willingly inflict
dont dwell so much on the prophecies but read the clearer parts of the bible  i dare say it would be wiser but where would i hear such grand words of promisehear tell o anything so far different fro this dreary world and this town above a as in revelations
manys the time ive repeated the verses in the seventh chapter to myself just for the sound
its as good as an organ and as different from every day too
no i cannot give up revelations
it gives me more comfort than any other book i the bible  let me come and read you some of my favourite chapters  ay said she greedily come
father will maybe hear yo hes deaved wi my talking he says its all nought to do with the things o today and thats his business  where is your sister  gone fustian cutting
i were loth to let her go but somehow we must live and th union cant afford us much  now i must go
you have done me good bessy  i done you good  yes i came here very sad and rather too apt to think my own cause for grief was the only one in the world
and now i hear how you have had to bear for years and that makes me stronger  bless yo
i thought a the gooddoing was on the side of gentlefolk
i shall get proud if i think i can do good to yo  you wont do it if you think about it
but youll only puzzle yourself if you do thats one comfort  youre not like no one i ever seed
i dunno what to make of yo  nor i of myself
goodbye  bessy stilled her rocking to gaze after her
i wonder if there are many folk like her down south
shes like a breath of country air somehow
she freshens me up above a bit
whod a thought that faceas bright and as strong as the angel i dream ofcould have known the sorrow she speaks on
i wonder how shell sin
all on us must sin
i think a deal on her for sure
but father does the like i see
and mary even
its not often hoos stirred up to notice much      likes and dislikes
my heart revolts within me and two voices     make themselves audible within my bosom               wallenstein
on margarets return home she found two letters on the table one was a note for her motherthe other which had come by the post was evidently from her aunt shawcovered with foreign postmarksthin silvery and rustling
she took up the other and was examining it when her father came in suddenly  so your mother is tired and gone to bed early
im afraid such a thundery day was not the best in the world for the doctor to see her
what did he say
dixon tells me he spoke to you about her  margaret hesitated
her fathers looks became more grave and anxious  he does not think her seriously ill  not at present she needs care he says he was very kind and he said he would call again and see how his medicines worked  only carehe did not recommend change of airhe did not say this smoky town was doing her any harm did he margaret  no
not a word she replied gravely
he was anxious i think  doctors have that anxious manner its professional said he
margaret saw in her fathers nervous ways that the first impression of possible danger was made upon his mind in spite of all his making light of what she told him
he could not forget the subjectcould not pass from it to other things he kept recurring to it through the evening with an unwillingness to receive even the slightest unfavourable idea which made margaret inexpressibly sad
this letter is from aunt shaw papa
she has got to naples and finds it too hot so she has taken apartments at sorrento
but i dont think she likes italy  he did not say anything about diet did he  it was to be nourishing and digestible
mammas appetite is pretty good i think  yes
and that makes it all the more strange he should have thought of speaking about diet  i asked him papa another pause
then margaret went on aunt shaw says she has sent me some coral ornaments papa but added margaret half smiling shes afraid the milton dissenters wont appreciate them
she has got all her ideas of dissenters from the quakers has she not  if ever you hear or notice that your mother wishes for anything be sure you let me know
i am so afraid she does not tell me always what she would like
pray see after that girl mrs thornton named
if we had a good efficient houseservant dixon could be constantly with her and id answer for it wed soon set her up amongst us if care will do it
shes been very much tired of late with the hot weather and the difficulty of getting a servant
a little rest will put her quite to rightseh margaret  i hope so said margaretbut so sadly that her father took notice of it
he pinched her cheek
come if you look so pale as this i must rouge you up a little
take care of yourself child or youll be wanting the doctor next  but he could not settle to anything that evening
he was continually going backwards and forwards on laborious tiptoe to see if his wife was still asleep
margarets heart ached at his restlessnesshis trying to stifle and strangle the hideous fear that was looming out of the dark places of his heart
he came back at last somewhat comforted
shes awake now margaret
she quite smiled as she saw me standing by her
just her old smile
and she says she feels refreshed and ready for tea
wheres the note for her
she wants to see it
ill read it to her while you make tea  the note proved to be a formal invitation from mrs thornton to mr mrs and miss hale to dinner on the twentyfirst instant
margaret was surprised to find an acceptance contemplated after all she had learnt of sad probabilities during the day
but so it was
the idea of her husbands and daughters going to this dinner had quite captivated mrs hales fancy even before margaret had heard the contents of the note
it was an event to diversify the monotony of the invalids life and she clung to the idea of their going with even fretful pertinacity when margaret objected
nay margaret if she wishes it im sure well both go willingly
she never would wish it unless she felt herself really strongerreally better than we thought she was eh margaret said mr hale anxiously as she prepared to write the note of acceptance the next day
eh
margaret questioned he with a nervous motion of his hands
it seemed cruel to refuse him the comfort he craved for
and besides his passionate refusal to admit the existence of fear almost inspired margaret herself with hope
i do think she is better since last night said she
her eyes look brighter and her complexion clearer  god bless you said her father earnestly
but is it true
yesterday was so sultry every one felt ill
it was a most unlucky day for mr donaldson to see her on  so he went away to his days duties now increased by the preparation of some lectures he had promised to deliver to the working people at a neighbouring lyceum
he had chosen ecclesiastical architecture as his subject rather more in accordance with his own taste and knowledge than as falling in with the character of the place or the desire for particular kinds of information among those to whom he was to lecture
and the institution itself being in debt was only too glad to get a gratis course from an educated and accomplished man like mr hale let the subject be what it might
well mother asked mr thornton that night who have accepted your invitations for the twentyfirst  fanny where are the notes
the slicksons accept collingbrooks accept stephenses accept browns decline
halesfather and daughter comemother too great an invalidmacphersons come and mr horsfall and mr young
i was thinking of asking the porters as the browns cant come  very good
do you know im really afraid mrs hale is very far from well from what dr donaldson says  its strange of them to accept a dinnerinvitation if shes very ill said fanny
i didnt say very ill said her brother rather sharply
i only said far from well
they may not know it either and then he suddenly remembered that from what dr donaldson had told him margaret at any rate must be aware of the exact state of the case
very probably they are quite aware of what you said yesterday johnof the great advantage it would be to themto mr hale i mean to be introduced to such people as the stephenses and the collingbrooks  im sure that motive would not influence them
no
i think i understand how it is  john said fanny laughing in her little weak nervous way
how you profess to understand these hales and how you never will allow that we can know anything about them
are they really so very different to most people one meets with  she did not mean to vex him but if she had intended it she could not have done it more thoroughly
he chafed in silence however not deigning to reply to her question
they do not seem to me out of the common way said mrs thornton
he appears a worthy kind of man enough rather too simple for tradeso its perhaps as well he should have been a clergyman first and now a teacher
shes a bit of a fine lady with her invalidism and as for the girlshes the only one who puzzles me when i think about herwhich i dont often do
she seems to have a great notion of giving herself airs and i cant make out why
i could almost fancy she thinks herself too good for her company at times
and yet theyre not rich from all i can hear they never have been  and shes not accomplished mamma
she cant play  go on fanny
what else does she want to bring her up to your standard  nay
john said his mother that speech of fannys did no harm
i myself heard miss hale say she could not play
if you would let us alone we could perhaps like her and see her merits  im sure i never could murmured fanny protected by her mother
mr thornton heard but did not care to reply
he was walking up and down the diningroom wishing that his mother would order candles and allow him to set to work at either reading or writing and so put a stop to the conversation
but he never thought of interfering in any of the small domestic regulations that mrs thornton observed in habitual remembrance of her old economies
mother said he stopping and bravely speaking out the truth i wish you would like miss hale  why asked she startled by his earnest yet tender manner
youre never thinking of marrying hera girl without a penny  she would never have me said he with a short laugh
no i dont think she would answered his mother
she laughed in my face when i praised her for speaking out something mr bell had said in your favour
i liked the girl for doing so frankly for it made me sure she had no thought of you and the next minute she vexed me so by seeming to think well never mind
only youre right in saying shes too good an opinion of herself to think of you
the saucy jade
i should like to know where shed find a better  well as im just as much convinced of the truth of what you have been saying as you can be and as i have no thought or expectation of ever asking her to be my wife youll believe me for the future that im quite disinterested in speaking about her
i foresee trouble for that girlperhaps want of motherly careand i only wish you to be ready to be a friend to her in case she needs one
now fanny said he i trust you have delicacy enough to understand that it is as great an injury to miss hale as to mein fact she would think it a greaterto suppose that i have any reason more than i now give for begging you and my mother to show her every kindly attention  i cannot forgive her her pride said his mother i will befriend her if there is need for your asking john
i would befriend jezebel herself if you asked me
but this girl who turns up her nose at us allwho turns up her nose at you  nay mother i have never yet put myself and i mean never to put myself within reach of her contempt  contempt indeedone of mrs thorntons expressive snorts
dont go on speaking of miss hale john if ive to be kind to her
when im with her i dont know if i like or dislike her most but when i think of her and hear you talk of her i hate her
i can see shes given herself airs to you as well as if youd told me out  and if she has said heand then he paused for a momentthen went on im not a lad to be cowed by a proud look from a woman or to care for her misunderstanding me and my position
i can laugh at it  to be sure
and at her too with her fine notions and haughty tosses  i only wonder why you talk so much about her then said fanny
im sure im tired enough of the subject  well said her brother with a shade of bitterness
suppose we find some more agreeable subject
what do you say to a strike by way of something pleasant to talk about  have the hands actually turned out asked mrs thornton with vivid interest
hampers men are actually out
mine are working out their week through fear of being prosecuted for breach of contract
id have had every one of them up and punished for it that left his work before his time was out  the law expenses would have been more than the hands themselves were wortha set of ungrateful naughts said his mother
to be sure
but id have shown them how to keep my word and how i mean them to keep theirs
they know me by this time
slicksons men are offpretty certain he wont spend money in getting them punished
were in for a turnout mother  i hope there are not many orders in hand  of course there are
they know that well enough
but they dont quite understand all though they think they do  what do you mean john  candles had been brought and fanny had taken up her interminable piece of worstedwork over which she was yawning throwing herself back in her chair from time to time to gaze at vacancy and think of nothing at her ease
why said he the americans are getting their yarns so into the general market that our only chance is producing them at a lower rate
if we cant we may shut up shop at once and hands and masters alike go on tramp
yet these fools go back to the prices paid three years agonay some of their leaders quote dickinsons price nowthough they know as well as we do that what with fines pressed out of their wages as no honourable man would extort them the real rate of wage paid at dickinsons is less than at ours
upon my word mother i wish the old combination laws were in force
it is too bad to find out that foolsignorant wayward men like thesejust by uniting their silly heads are to rule over the fortunes of those who bring all the wisdom that knowledge and experience and often painful thought and anxiety can give
the next thing will beindeed weve all but come to it nowthat we shall have to go and askstand hat in handand humbly ask the secretary of the spinners union to be so kind as to furnish us with labour at their own price
thats what they wantthey who havent the sense to see that if we dont get a fair share of the profits to compensate us for our wear and tear here in england we can move off to some other country and that what with home and foreign competition we are none of us likely to make above a fair share and may be thankful enough if we can get that in an average number of years  cant you get hands from ireland
i wouldnt keep these fellows a day
id teach them that i was master and could employ what servants i liked  yes
to be sure i can and will too if they go on long
it will be trouble and expense and i fear there will be some danger but i will do it rather than give in  if there is to be all this extra expense im sorry were giving a dinner just now  so am inot because of the expense but because i shall have much to think about and many unexpected calls on my time
but we must have had mr horsfall and he does not stay in milton long
and as for the others we owe them dinners and its all one trouble  he kept on with his restless walknot speaking any more but drawing a deep breath from time to time as if endeavouring to throw off some annoying thought
fanny asked her mother numerous small questions all having nothing to do with the subject which a wiser person would have perceived was occupying her attention
consequently she received many short answers
she was not sorry when at ten oclock the servants filed in to prayers
these her mother always readfirst reading a chapter
they were now working steadily through the old testament
when prayers were ended and his mother had wished him goodnight with that long steady look of hers which conveyed no expression of the tenderness that was in her heart but yet had the intensity of a blessing mr thornton continued his walk
all his business plans had received a check a sudden pullup from this approaching turnout
the forethought of many anxious hours was thrown away utterly wasted by their insane folly which would injure themselves even more than him though no one could set any limit to the mischief they were doing
and these were the men who thought themselves fitted to direct the masters in the disposal of their capital hamper had said only this very day that if he were ruined by the strike he would start life again comforted by the conviction that those who had brought it on were in a worse predicament than he himselffor he had head as well as hands while they had only hands and if they drove away their market they could not follow it nor turn to anything else
but this thought was no consolation to mr thornton
it might be that revenge gave him no pleasure it might be that he valued the position he had earned with the sweat of his brow so much that he keenly felt its being endangered by the ignorance or folly of othersso keenly that he had no thoughts to spare for what would be the consequences of their conduct to themselves
he paced up and down setting his teeth now and then
at last it struck two
the candles were flickering in their sockets
he lighted his own muttering to himself  once for all they shall know whom they have got to deal with
i can give them a fortnightno more
if they dont see their madness before the end of that time i must have hands from ireland
i believe its slicksons doingconfound him and his dodges
he thought he was overstocked so he seemed to yield at first when the deputation came to himand of course he only confirmed them in their folly as he meant to do
thats where it spread from      angel visits
as angels in some brighter dreams        call to the soul when man doth sleep      so some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes        and into glory peep                                    henry vaughan
mrs hale was curiously amused and interested by the idea of the thornton dinner party
she kept wondering about the details with something of the simplicity of a little child who wants to have all its anticipated pleasure described beforehand
but the monotonous life led by invalids often makes them like children inasmuch as they have neither of them any sense of proportion in events and seem each to believe that the walls and curtains which shut in their world and shut out everything else must of necessity be larger than anything hidden beyond
besides mrs hale had had her vanities as a girl had perhaps unduly felt their mortification when she became a poor clergymans wifethey had been smothered and kept down but they were not extinct and she liked to think of seeing margaret dressed for a party and discussed what she should wear with an unsettled anxiety that amused margaret who had been more accustomed to society in her one year in harley street than her mother in five and twenty years of helstone
then you think you shall wear your white silk
are you sure it will fit
its nearly a year since edith was married  oh yes mamma
mrs murray made it and its sure to be right it may be a straws breadth shorter or longerwaisted according to my having grown fat or thin
but i dont think ive altered in the least  hadnt you better let dixon see it
it may have gone yellow with lying by  if you like mamma
but if the worst comes to the worst ive a very nice pink gauze which aunt shaw gave me only two or three months before edith was married
that cant have gone yellow  no
but it may have faded  well
then ive a green silk
i feel more as if it was the embarrassment of riches  i wish i knew what you ought to wear said mrs hale nervously
margarets manner changed instantly
shall i go and put them on one after another mamma and then you could see which you liked best  butyes
perhaps that will be best  so off margaret went
she was very much inclined to play some pranks when she was dressed up at such an unusual hour to make her rich white silk balloon out into a cheese to retreat backwards from her mother as if she were the queen but when she found that these freaks of hers were regarded as interruptions to the serious business and as such annoyed her mother she became grave and sedate
what had possessed the world her world to fidget so about her dress she could not understand but that very afternoon on naming her engagement to bessy higgins apropos of the servant that mrs thornton had promised to enquire about bessy quite roused up at the intelligence
dear
and are you going to dine at thorntons at marlborough mills  yes bessy
why are you so surprised  oh i dunno
but they visit wi a th first folk in milton  and you dont think were quite the first folk in milton eh bessy  bessys cheeks flushed a little at her thought being thus easily read
well said she yo see they thinken a deal o money here and i reckon yove not getten much  no said margaret thats very true
but we are educated people and have lived amongst educated people
is there anything so wonderful in our being asked out to dinner by a man who owns himself inferior to my father by coming to him to be instructed
i dont mean to blame mr thornton
few drapers assistants as he was once could have made themselves what he is  but can yo give dinners back in yore small house
thorntons house is three times as big  well i think we could manage to give mr thornton a dinner back as you call it
perhaps not in such a large room nor with so many people
but i dont think weve thought about it at all in that way  i never thought yod be dining with thorntons repeated bessy
why the mayor hissel dines there and the members of parliament and all  i think i could support the honour of meeting the mayor of milton  but them ladies dress so grand said bessy with an anxious look at margarets print gown which her milton eyes appraised at sevenpence a yard
margarets face dimpled up into a merry laugh
thank you bessy for thinking so kindly about my looking nice among all the smart people
but ive plenty of grand gownsa week ago i should have said they were far too grand for anything i should ever want here
but as im to dine at mr thorntons and perhaps to meet the mayor i shall put on my very best gown you may be sure  what win yo wear asked bessy somewhat relieved
white silk said margaret
a gown i had for a cousins wedding a year ago  thatll do said bessy falling back in her chair
i should be loth to have yo looked down upon  oh
ill be fine enough if that will save me from being looked down upon in milton  i wish i could see you dressed up said bessy
i reckon yore not what folk would ca pretty yove not red and white enough for that
but dun yo know i ha dreamt of yo long afore ever i seed yo  nonsense bessy  ay but i did
yor very facelooking wi yor clear steadfast eyes out o th darkness wi yor hair blown off from yor brow and going out like rays round yor forehead which was just as smooth and straight as it is nowand yo always came to give me strength which i seemed to gather out o yor deep comforting eyesand yo was drest in shining raimentjust as yor going to be drest
so yo see it was yo  nay bessy said margaret gently it was but a dream  and why might na i dream a dream in my affliction as well as others
did not many a one i the bible
ay and see visions too
why even my father thinks a deal o dreams
i tell yo again i saw yo as plainly coming swiftly towards me wi yor hair blown back wi the very swiftness o the motion just like the way it grows a little standing off like and the white shining dress on yove getten to wear
let me come and see yo in it
i want to see yo and touch yo as in very deed yo were in my dream  my dear bessy it is quite a fancy of yours  fancy or no fancyyove come as i knew yo would when i saw yor movement in my dreamand when yore here about me i reckon i feel easier in my mind and comforted just as a fire comforts one on a dree day
yo said it were on th twentyfirst please god ill come and see yo  oh bessy
you may come and welcome but dont talk soit really makes me sorry
it does indeed  then ill keep it to mysel if i bite my tongue out
not but what its true for all that  margaret was silent
at last she said let us talk about it sometimes if you think it true
but not now
tell me has your father turned out  ay said bessy heavilyin a manner very different from that she had spoken in but a minute or two before
he and many anotherall hampers menand many a one besides
th women are as bad as th men in their savageness this time
food is highand they mun have food for their childer i reckon
suppose thorntons sent em their dinner outth same money spent on potatoes and meal would keep many a crying baby quiet and hush up its mothers heart for a bit  dont speak so said margaret
youll make me feel wicked and guilty in going to this dinner  no said bessy
somes preelected to sumptuous feasts and purple and fine linenmay be yore one on em
others toil and moil all their lives longand the very dogs are not pitiful in our days as they were in the days of lazarus
but if yo ask me to cool yore tongue wi th tip of my finger ill come across the great gulf to yo just for th thought o what yove been to me here  bessy youre very feverish
i can tell it in the touch of your hand as well us in what youre saying
it wont be division enough in that awful day that some of us have been beggars here and some of us have been richwe shall not be judged by that poor accident but by our faithful following of christ  margaret got up and found some water and soaking her pockethandkerchief in it she laid the cool wetness on bessys forehead and began to chafe the stonecold feet
bessy shut her eyes and allowed herself to be soothed
at last she said  yod ha been deaved out o yor five wits as well as me if yod had one body after another coming in to ask for father and staying to tell me each one their tale
some spoke o deadly hatred and made my blood run cold wi the terrible things they said o th mastersbut more being women kept plaining plaining wi the tears running down their cheeks and never wiped away nor heeded of the price o meat and how their childer could na sleep at nights for th hunger  and do they think the strike will mend this asked margaret
they say so replied bessy
they do say trade has been good for long and the masters has made no end o money how much father doesnt know but in course th union does and as it is natural they wanted their share o th profits now that food is getting dear and th union says theyll not be doing their duty if they dont make th masters give em their share
but masters has getten th upper hand somehow and im feared theyll keep it now and evermore
its like th great battle o armageddon the way they keep on grinning and fighting at each other till even while they fight they are picked off into the pit  just then nicholas higgins came in
he caught his daughters last words
ay
and ill fight on too and ill got it this time
itll not take long for to make em give in for theyve getten a pretty lot of orders all under contract and theyll soon find out theyd better give us our five per cent
than lose the profit theyll gain let alone the fine for not fulfilling the contract
aha my masters
i know wholl win  margaret fancied from his manner that he must have been drinking not so much from what he said as from the excited way in which he spoke and she was rather confirmed in this idea by the evident anxiety bessie showed to hasten her departure
bessy said to her  the twentyfirstthats thursday week
i may come and see yo dressed for thorntons i reckon
what time is yor dinner  before margaret could answer higgins broke out  thorntons
ar t going to dine at thorntons
ask him to give yo a bumper to the success of his orders
by th twentyfirst i reckon hell be pottered in his brains how to get em done in time
tell him theres seven hundred ll come marching into marlborough mills the morning after he gives the five per cent and will help him through his contract in no time
youll have em all there
my master hamper
hes one o th oudfashioned sort
neer meets a man bout an oath or a curse i should think he were going to die if he spoke me civil but arter all his barks waur than his bite and yo may tell him one o his turnouts said so if yo like
eh
but yoll have a lot of prize millowners at thorntons
i should like to get speech o them when theyre a bit inclined to sit still after dinner and could na run for the life on em
id tell em my mind
id speak up again th hard way theyre driving on us  goodbye said margaret hastily
goodbye bessy
i shall look to see you on the twentyfirst if youre well enough  the medicines and treatment which dr donaldson had ordered for mrs hale did her so much good at first that not only she herself but margaret began to hope that he might have been mistaken and that she could recover permanently
as for mr hale although he had never had an idea of the serious nature of their apprehensions he triumphed over their fears with an evident relief which proved how much his glimpse into the nature of them had affected him
only dixon croaked for ever into margarets ear
however margaret defied the raven and would hope
they needed this gleam of brightness indoors for outofdoors even to their uninstructed eyes there was a gloomy brooding appearance of discontent
mr hale had his own acquaintances among the working men and was depressed with their earnestlytold tales of suffering and longendurance
they would have scorned to speak of what they had to bear to any one who might from his position have understood it without their words
but here was this man from a distant county who was perplexed by the workings of a system into the midst of which he was thrown and each was eager to make him a judge and to bring witness of his own causes for irritation
then mr hale brought all his budget of grievances and laid it before mr thornton for him with his experience as a master to arrange them and explain their origin which he always did on sound economical principles showing that as trade was conducted there must always be a waxing and waning of commercial prosperity and that in the waning a certain number of masters as well as of men must go down into ruin and be no more seen among the ranks of the happy and prosperous
he spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical that neither employers nor employed had any right to complain if it became their fate the employer to turn aside from the race he could no longer run with a bitter sense of incompetency and failurewounded in the struggletrampled down by his fellows in their haste to get richslighted where he was once honouredhumbly asking for instead of bestowing employment with a lordly hand
of course speaking so of the fate that as a master might be his own in the fluctuations of commerce he was not likely to have more sympathy with that of the workmen who were passed by in the swift merciless improvement or alteration who would fain lie down and quietly die out of the world that needed them not but felt as they could never rest in their graves for the clinging cries of the beloved and helpless they would leave behind who envied the power of the wild bird that can feed her young with her very hearts blood
margarets whole soul rose up against him while he reasoned in this wayas if commerce were everything and humanity nothing
she could hardly thank him for the individual kindness which brought him that very evening to offer herfor the delicacy which made him understand that he must offer her privatelyevery convenience for illness that his own wealth or his mothers foresight had caused them to accumulate in their household and which as he learnt from dr donaldson mrs hale might possibly require
his presence after the way he had spokenhis bringing before her the doom which she was vainly trying to persuade herself might yet be averted from her motherall conspired to set margarets teeth on edge as she looked at him and listened to him
what business had he to be the only person except dr donaldson and dixon admitted to the awful secret which she held shut up in the most dark and sacred recess of her heartnot daring to look at it unless she invoked heavenly strength to bear the sightthat some day soon she should cry aloud for her mother and no answer would come out of the blank dumb darkness
yet he knew all
she saw it in his pitying eyes
she heard it in his grave and tremulous voice
how reconcile those eyes that voice with the hard reasoning dry merciless way in which he laid down axioms of trade and serenely followed them out to their full consequences
the discord jarred upon her inexpressibly
the more because of the gathering woe of which she heard from bessy
to be sure nicholas higgins the father spoke differently
he had been appointed a committeeman and said that he knew secrets of which the exoteric knew nothing
he said this more expressly and particularly on the very day before mrs thorntons dinnerparty
when margaret going in to speak to bessy found him arguing the point with boucher the neighbour of whom she had frequently heard mention as by turns exciting higginss compassion as an unskilful workman with a large family depending upon him for support and at other times enraging his more energetic and sanguine neighbour by his want of what the latter called spirit
it was very evident that higgins was in a passion when margaret entered
boucher stood with both hands on the rather high mantelpiece swaying himself a little on the support which his arms thus placed gave him and looking wildly into the fire with a kind of despair that irritated higgins even while it went to his heart
bessy was rocking herself violently backwards and forwards as was her wont margaret knew by this time when she was agitated
her sister mary was tying on her bonnet in great clumsy bows as suited her great clumsy fingers to go to her fustiancutting blubbering out loud the while and evidently longing to be away from a scene that distressed her
margaret came in upon this scene
she stood for a moment at the doorthen her finger on her lips she stole to a seat on the squab near bessy
nicholas saw her come in and greeted her with a gruff but not unfriendly nod
mary hurried out of the house catching gladly at the open door and crying aloud when she got away from her fathers presence
it was only john boucher that took no notice whatever who came in and who went out
its no use higgins

i ha thought till my brains achedbeli me john i have
an i say again theres no help for us but having faith i th union
theyll win the day see if they dunnot  not one word had margaret or bessy spoken
they had hardly uttered the sighing that the eyes of each called to the other to bring up from the depths of her heart
at last bessy said  i never thought to hear father call on god again
but yo heard him say so help me god  yes said margaret
let me bring you what money i can sparelet me bring you a little food for that poor mans children
dont let them know it comes from any one but your father
it will be but little  bessy lay back without taking any notice of what margaret said
she did not cryshe only quivered up her breath
my hearts drained dry o tears she said
bouchers been in these days past a telling me of his fears and his troubles
hes but a weak kind of chap i know but hes a man for a that and tho ive been angry many a time afore now wi him an his wife as knew no more nor him how to manage yet yo see all folks isnt wise yet god lets em liveay an gives em some one to love and be loved by just as good as solomon
an if sorrow comes to them they love it hurts em as sore as eer it did solomon
i cant make it out
perhaps its as well such a one as boucher has th union to see after him
but id just like for to see th men as make th union and put em one by one face to face wi boucher
i reckon if they heard him thed tell him if i cotched em one by one he might go back and get what he could for his work even if it werent so much as they ordered  margaret sat utterly silent
how was she ever to go away into comfort and forget that mans voice with the tone of unutterable agony telling more by far than his words of what he had to suffer
she took out her purse she had not much in it of what she could call her own but what she had she put into bessys hands without speaking
thank yo
theres many on em gets no more and is not so bad offleastways does not show it as he does
but father wont let em want now he knows
yo see bouchers been pulled down wi his childerand her being so cranky and a they could pawn has gone this last twelvemonth
yore not to think wed ha letten em clem for all were a bit pressed oursel if neighbours doesnt see after neighbours i dunno who will bessy seemed almost afraid lest margaret should think they had not the will and to a certain degree the power of helping one whom she evidently regarded as having a claim upon them
besides she went on father is sure and positive the masters must give in within these next few daysthat they canna hould on much longer
but i thank yo all the samei thank yo for mysel as much as for boucher for it jus makes my heart warm to yo more and more  bessy seemed much quieter today but fearfully languid and exhausted
as she finished speaking she looked so faint and weary that margaret became alarmed
its nout said bessy
its not death yet
i had a fearfu night wi dreamsor somewhat like dreams for i were wide awakeand im all in a swounding daze todayonly yon poor chap made me alive again
no
its not death yet but death is not far off

good nightgood afternoon mappen i should saybut th light is dim an misty today      men and gentlemen
old and young boy let em all eat i have it     let em have ten tire of teeth apiece i care not
rollo duke of normandy
margaret went home so painfully occupied with what she had heard and seen that she hardly knew how to rouse herself up to the duties which awaited her the necessity for keeping up a constant flow of cheerful conversation for her mother who now that she was unable to go out always looked to margarets return from the shortest walk as bringing in some news
and can your factory friend come on thursday to see you dressed  she was so ill i never thought of asking her said margaret dolefully
dear
everybody is ill now i think said mrs hale with a little of the jealousy which one invalid is apt to feel of another
but it must be very sad to be ill in one of those little back streets her kindly nature prevailing and the old helstone habits of thought returning
its bad enough here
what could you do for her margaret
mr thornton has sent me some of his old port wine since you went out
would a bottle of that do her good think you  no mamma
i dont believe they are very poorat least they dont speak as if they were and at any rate bessys illness is consumptionshe wont want wine
perhaps i might take her a little preserve made of our dear helstone fruit
no
theres another family to whom i should like to giveoh mamma mamma
how am i to dress up in my finery and go off and away to smart parties after the sorrow ive seen today exclaimed margaret bursting the bounds she had preordained for herself before she came in and telling her mother what she had seen and heard at higginss cottage
it distressed mrs hale excessively
it made her restlessly irritated till she could do something
she directed margaret to pack up a basket in the very drawingroom to be sent there and then to the family and was almost angry with her for saying that it would not signify if it did not go till morning as she knew higgins had provided for their immediate wants and she herself had left money with bessy
mrs hale called her unfeeling for saying this and never gave herself breathingtime till the basket was sent out of the house
then she said  after all we may have been doing wrong
it was only the last time mr thornton was here that he said those were no true friends who helped to prolong the struggle by assisting the turnouts
and this boucherman was a turnout was he not  the question was referred to mr hale by his wife when he came upstairs fresh from giving a lesson to mr thornton which had ended in conversation as was their wont
margaret did not care if their gifts had prolonged the strife she did not think far enough for that in her present excited state
mr hale listened and tried to be as calm as a judge he recalled all that had seemed so clear not halfanhour before as it came out of mr thorntons lips and then he made an unsatisfactory compromise
his wife and daughter had not only done quite right in this instance but he did not see for a moment how they could have done otherwise
nevertheless as a general rule it was very true what mr thornton said that as the strike if prolonged must end in the masters bringing hands from a distance if indeed the final result were not as it had often been before the invention of some machine which would diminish the need of hands at all why it was clear enough that the kindest thing was to refuse all help which might bolster them up in their folly
but as to this boucher he would go and see him the first thing in the morning and try and find out what could be done for him
mr hale went the next morning as he proposed
he did not find boucher at home but he had a long talk with his wife promised to ask for an infirmary order for and seeing the plenty provided by mrs hale and somewhat lavishly used by the children who were masters downstairs in their fathers absence he came back with a more consoling and cheerful account than margaret had dared to hope for indeed what she had said the night before had prepared her father for so much worse a state of things that by a reaction of his imagination he described all as better than it really was
but i will go again and see the man himself said mr hale
i hardly know as yet how to compare one of these houses with our helstone cottages
i see furniture here which our labourers would never have thought of buying and food commonly used which they would consider luxuries yet for these very families there seems no other resource now that their weekly wages are stopped but the pawnshop
one had need to learn a different standard up here in milton  bessy too was rather better this day
still she was so weak that she seemed to have entirely forgotten her wish to see margaret dressedif indeed that had not been the feverish desire of a half delirious state
margaret could not help comparing this strange dressing of hers to go where she did not care to beher heart heavy with various anxietieswith the old merry girlish toilettes that she and edith had performed scarcely more than a year ago
her only pleasure now in decking herself out was in thinking that her mother would take delight in seeing her dressed
she blushed when dixon throwing the drawingroom door open made an appeal for admiration
miss hale looks well maamdoesnt she
mrs shaws coral couldnt have come in better
it just gives the right touch of colour maam
otherwise miss margaret you would have been too pale  margarets black hair was too thick to be plaited it needed rather to be twisted round and round and have its fine silkiness compressed into massive coils that encircled her head like a crown and then were gathered into a large spiral knot behind
she kept its weight together by two large coral pins like small arrows for length
her white silk sleeves were looped up with strings of the same material and on her neck just below the base of her curved and milkwhite throat there lay heavy coral beads
oh margaret
how i should like to be going with you to one of the old barrington assembliestaking you as lady beresford used to take me  margaret kissed her mother for this little burst of maternal vanity but she could hardly smile at it she felt so much out of spirits
i would rather stay at home with youmuch rather mamma  nonsense darling
be sure you notice the dinner well
i shall like to hear how they manage these things in milton
particularly the second course dear
look what they have instead of game  mrs hale would have been more than interestedshe would have been astonished if she had seen the sumptuousness of the dinnertable and its appointments
margaret with her london cultivated taste felt the number of delicacies to be oppressive one half of the quantity would have been enough and the effect tighter and more elegant
but it was one of mrs thorntons rigorous laws of hospitality that of each separate dainty enough should be provided for all the guests to partake if they felt inclined
careless to abstemiousness in her daily habits it was part of her pride to set a feast before such of her guests as cared for it
her son shared this feeling
he had never knownthough he might have imagined and had the capability to relishany kind of society but that which depended on an exchange of superb meals and even now though he was denying himself the personal expenditure of an unnecessary sixpence and had more than once regretted that the invitations for this dinner had been sent out still as it was to be he was glad to see the old magnificence of preparation
margaret and her father were the first to arrive
mr hale was anxiously punctual to the time specified
there was no one upstairs in the drawingroom but mrs thornton and fanny
every cover was taken off and the apartment blazed forth in yellow silk damask and a brilliantly flowered carpet
every corner seemed filled up with ornament until it became a weariness to the eye and presented a strange contrast to the bald ugliness of the lookout into the great millyard where wide folding gates were thrown open for the admission of carriages
the mill loomed high on the lefthand side of the windows casting a shadow down from its many stories which darkened the summer evening before its time
my son was engaged up to the last moment on business
he will be here directly mr hale
may i beg you to take a seat  mr hale was standing at one of the windows as mrs thornton spoke
he turned away saying  dont you find such close neighbourhood to the mill rather unpleasant at times  she drew herself up  never
i am not become so fine as to desire to forget the source of my sons wealth and power
besides there is not such another factory in milton
one room alone is two hundred and twenty square yards  i meant that the smoke and the noisethe constant going out and coming in of the workpeople might be annoying  i agree with you mr hale said fanny
there is a continual smell of steam and oily machineryand the noise is perfectly deafening  i have heard noise that was called music far more deafening
the engineroom is at the streetend of the factory we hardly hear it except in summer weather when all the windows are open and as for the continual murmur of the workpeople it disturbs me no more than the humming of a hive of bees
if i think of it at all i connect it with my son and feel how all belongs to him and that his is the head that directs it
just now there are no sounds to come from the mill the hands have been ungrateful enough to turn out as perhaps you have heard
but the very business of which i spoke when you entered had reference to the steps he is going to take to make them learn their place the expression on her face always stern deepened into dark anger as she said this
nor did it clear away when mr thornton entered the room for she saw in an instant the weight of care and anxiety which he could not shake off although his guests received from him a greeting that appeared both cheerful and cordial
he shook hands with margaret
he knew it was the first time their hands had met though she was perfectly unconscious of the fact
he inquired after mrs hale and heard mr hales sanguine hopeful account and glancing to margaret to understand how far she agreed with her father he saw that no dissenting shadow crossed her face
and as he looked with this intention he was struck anew with her great beauty
he had never seen her in such dress before and yet now it appeared that such elegance of attire was so befitting her noble figure and lofty serenity of countenance that she ought to go always thus apparelled
she was talking to fanny about what he could not hear but he saw his sisters restless way of continually arranging some part of her gown her wandering eyes now glancing here now there but without any purpose in her observation and he contrasted them uneasily with the large soft eyes that looked forth steadily at one object as if from out their light beamed some gentle influence of repose the curving lines of the red lips just parted in the interest of listening to what her companion saidthe head a little bent forwards so as to make a long sweeping line from the summit where the light caught on the glossy raven hair to the smooth ivory tip of the shoulder the round white arms and taper hands laid lightly across each other but perfectly motionless in their pretty attitude
mr thornton sighed as he took in all this with one of his sudden comprehensive glances
and then he turned his back to the young ladies and threw himself with an effort but with all his heart and soul into a conversation with mr hale
more people camemore and more
fanny left margarets side and helped her mother to receive her guests
mr thornton felt that in this influx no one was speaking to margaret and was restless under this apparent neglect
but he never went near her himself he did not look at her
only he knew what she was doingor not doingbetter than he knew the movements of any one else in the room
margaret was so unconscious of herself and so much amused by watching other people that she never thought whether she was left unnoticed or not
somebody took her down to dinner she did not catch the name nor did he seem much inclined to talk to her
there was a very animated conversation going on among the gentlemen the ladies for the most part were silent employing themselves in taking notes of the dinner and criticising each others dresses
margaret caught the clue to the general conversation grew interested and listened attentively
mr horsfall the stranger whose visit to the town was the original germ of the party was asking questions relative to the trade and manufactures of the place and the rest of the gentlemenall milton menwere giving him answers and explanations
some dispute arose which was warmly contested it was referred to mr thornton who had hardly spoken before but who now gave an opinion the grounds of which were so clearly stated that even the opponents yielded
margarets attention was thus called to her host his whole manner as master of the house and entertainer of his friends was so straightforward yet simple and modest as to be thoroughly dignified
margaret thought she had never seen him to so much advantage
when he had come to their house there had been always something either of overeagerness or of that kind of vexed annoyance which seemed ready to presuppose that he was unjustly judged and yet felt too proud to try and make himself better understood
but now among his fellows there was no uncertainty as to his position
he was regarded by them as a man of great force of character of power in many ways
there was no need to struggle for their respect
he had it and he knew it and the security of this gave a fine grand quietness to his voice and ways which margaret had missed before
he was not in the habit of talking to ladies and what he did say was a little formal
to margaret herself he hardly spoke at all
she was surprised to think how much she enjoyed this dinner
she knew enough now to understand many local interestsnay even some of the technical words employed by the eager millowners
she silently took a very decided part in the question they were discussing
at any rate they talked in desperate earnestnot in the usedup style that wearied her so in the old london parties
she wondered that with all this dwelling on the manufacturers and trade of the place no allusion was made to the strike then pending
she did not yet know how coolly such things were taken by the masters as having only one possible end
to be sure the men were cutting their own throats as they had done many a time before but if they would be fools and put themselves into the hands of a rascally set of paid delegates they must take the consequence
one or two thought thornton looked out of spirits and of course he must lose by this turnout
but it was an accident that might happen to themselves any day and thornton was as good to manage a strike as any one for he was as iron a chap as any in milton
the hands had mistaken their man in trying that dodge on him
and they chuckled inwardly at the idea of the workmens discomfiture and defeat in their attempt to alter one iota of what thornton had decreed
it was rather dull for margaret after dinner
she was glad when the gentlemen came not merely because she caught her fathers eye to brighten her sleepiness up but because she could listen to something larger and grander than the petty interests which the ladies had been talking about
she liked the exultation in the sense of power which these milton men had
it might be rather rampant in its display and savour of boasting but still they seemed to defy the old limits of possibility in a kind of fine intoxication caused by the recollection of what had been achieved and what yet should be
if in her cooler moments she might not approve of the spirit in all things still there was much to admire in their forgetfulness of themselves and the present in their anticipated triumphs over all inanimate matter at some future time which none of them would live to see
she was rather startled when mr thornton spoke to her close at her elbow  i could see you were on our side in our discussion at dinnerwere you not miss hale  certainly
but then i know so little about it
i was surprised however to find from what mr horsfall said that there were others who thought in so diametrically opposite a manner as the mr morison he spoke about
he cannot be a gentlemanis he  i am not quite the person to decide on anothers gentlemanliness miss hale
i mean i dont quite understand your application of the word
but i should say that this morison is no true man
i dont know who he is i merely judge him from mr horsfalls account  i suspect my gentleman includes your true man  and a great deal more you would imply
i differ from you
a man is to me a higher and a completer being than a gentleman  what do you mean asked margaret
we must understand the words differently  i take it that gentleman is a term that only describes a person in his relation to others but when we speak of him as a man we consider him not merely with regard to his fellowmen but in relation to himselfto lifeto timeto eternity
a castaway lonely as robinson crusoea prisoner immured in a dungeon for lifenay even a saint in patmos has his endurance his strength his faith best described by being spoken of as a man i am rather weary of this word gentlemanly which seems to me to be often inappropriately used and often too with such exaggerated distortion of meaning while the full simplicity of the noun man and the adjective manly are acknowledgedthat i am induced to class it with the cant of the day  margaret thought a momentbut before she could speak her slow conviction he was called away by some of the eager manufacturers whose speeches she could not hear though she could guess at their import by the short clear answers mr thornton gave which came steady and firm as the boom of a distant minute gun
they were evidently talking of the turnout and suggesting what course had best be pursued
she heard mr thornton say  that has been done then came a hurried murmur in which two or three joined
all those arrangements have been made  some doubts were implied some difficulties named by mr slickson who took hold of mr thorntons arm the better to impress his words
mr thornton moved slightly away lifted his eyebrows a very little and then replied  i take the risk
you need not join in it unless you choose still some more fears were urged
im not afraid of anything so dastardly as incendiarism
we are open enemies and i can protect myself from any violence that i apprehend
and i will assuredly protect all others who come to me for work
they know my determination by this time as well and as fully as you do  mr horsfall took him a little on one side as margaret conjectured to ask him some other question about the strike but in truth it was to inquire who she herself wasso quiet so stately and so beautiful
a milton lady asked he as the name was given
no
from the south of englandhampshire i believe was the cold indifferent answer
mrs slickson was catechising fanny on the same subject
who is that fine distinguishedlooking girl
a sister of mr horsfalls  oh dear no
that is mr hale her father talking now to mr stephens
he gives lessons that is to say he reads with young men
my brother john goes to him twice a week and so he begged mamma to ask them here in hopes of getting him known
i believe we have some of their prospectuses if you would like to have one  mr
thornton
does he really find time to read with a tutor in the midst of all his businessand this abominable strike in hand as well  fanny was not sure from mrs slicksons manner whether she ought to be proud or ashamed of her brothers conduct and like all people who try and take other peoples ought for the rule of their feelings she was inclined to blush for any singularity of action
her shame was interrupted by the dispersion of the guests
the dark night
on earth is known to none     the smile that is not sister to a tear                                 elliott
margaret and her father walked home
the night was fine the streets clean and with her pretty white silk like leezie lindsays gown o green satin in the ballad kilted up to her knee she was off with her fatherready to dance along with the excitement of the cool fresh night air
i rather think thornton is not quite easy in his mind about this strike
he seemed very anxious tonight  i should wonder if he were not
but he spoke with his usual coolness to the others when they suggested different things just before we came away  so he did after dinner as well
it would take a good deal to stir him from his cool manner of speaking but his face strikes me as anxious  i should be if i were he
he must know of the growing anger and hardly smothered hatred of his workpeople who all looked upon him as what the bible calls a hard mannot so much unjust as unfeeling clear in judgment standing upon his rights as no human being ought to stand considering what we and all our petty rights are in the sight of the almighty
i am glad you think he looks anxious
when i remember bouchers half mad words and ways i cannot bear to think how coolly mr thornton spoke  in the first place i am not so convinced as you are about that man bouchers utter distress for the moment he was badly off i dont doubt
but there is always a mysterious supply of money from these unions and from what you said it was evident the man was of a passionate demonstrative nature and gave strong expression to all he felt  oh papa  well
i only want you to do justice to mr thornton who is i suspect of an exactly opposite naturea man who is far too proud to show his feelings
just the character i should have thought beforehand you would have admired margaret  so i doso i should but i dont feel quite so sure as you do of the existence of those feelings
he is a man of great strength of characterof unusual intellect considering the few advantages he has had  not so few
he has led a practical life from a very early age has been called upon to exercise judgment and selfcontrol
all that developes one part of the intellect
to be sure he needs some of the knowledge of the past which gives the truest basis for conjecture as to the future but he knows this needhe perceives it and that is something
you are quite prejudiced against mr thornton margaret  he is the first specimen of a manufacturerof a person engaged in tradethat i had ever the opportunity of studying papa
he is my first olive let me make a face while i swallow it
i know he is good of his kind and by and by i shall like the kind
i rather think i am already beginning to do so
i was very much interested by what the gentlemen were talking about although i did not understand half of it
i was quite sorry when miss thornton came to take me to the other end of the room saying she was sure i should be uncomfortable at being the only lady among so many gentlemen
i had never thought about it i was so busy listening and the ladies were so dull papaoh so dull
yet i think it was clever too
it reminded me of our old game of having each so many nouns to introduce into a sentence  what do you mean child asked mr hale
why they took nouns that were signs of things which gave evidence of wealthhousekeepers undergardeners extent of glass valuable lace diamonds and all such things and each one formed her speech so as to bring them all in in the prettiest accidental manner possible  you will be as proud of your one servant when you get her if all is true about her that mrs thornton says  to be sure i shall
i felt like a great hypocrite tonight sitting there in my white silk gown with my idle hands before me when i remembered all the good thorough housework they had done today
they took me for a fine lady im sure  even i was mistaken enough to think you looked like a lady my dear said mr hale quietly smiling
but smiles were changed to white and trembling looks when they saw dixons face as she opened the door
oh masteroh miss margaret
thank god you are come
dr donaldson is here
the servant next door went for him for the charwoman is gone home
shes better now but oh sir
i thought shed have died an hour ago  mr hale caught margarets arm to steady himself from falling
he looked at her face and saw an expression upon it of surprise and extremest sorrow but not the agony of terror that contracted his own unprepared heart
she knew more than he did and yet she listened with that hopeless expression of awed apprehension
oh
i should not have left herwicked daughter that i am moaned forth margaret as she supported her trembling fathers hasty steps upstairs
dr donaldson met them on the landing
she is better now he whispered
the opiate has taken effect
the spasms were very bad no wonder they frightened your maid but shell rally this time  this time
let me go to her half an hour ago mr hale was a middleaged man now his sight was dim his senses wavering his walk tottering as if he were seventy years of age
dr donaldson took his arm and led him into the bedroom
margaret followed close
there lay her mother with an unmistakeable look on her face
she might be better now she was sleeping but death had signed her for his own and it was clear that ere long he would return to take possession
mr hale looked at her for some time without a word
then he began to shake all over and turning away from dr donaldsons anxious care he groped to find the door he could not see it although several candles brought in the sudden affright were burning and flaring there
he staggered into the drawingroom and felt about for a chair
dr donaldson wheeled one to him and placed him in it
he felt his pulse
speak to him miss hale
we must rouse him  papa said margaret with a crying voice that was wild with pain
papa
speak to me the speculation came again into his eyes and he made a great effort
margaret did you know of this
oh it was cruel of you  no sir it was not cruel replied dr donaldson with quick decision
miss hale acted under my directions
there may have been a mistake but it was not cruel
your wife will be a different creature tomorrow i trust
she has had spasms as i anticipated though i did not tell miss hale of my apprehensions
she has taken the opiate i brought with me she will have a good long sleep and tomorrow that look which has alarmed you so much will have passed away  but not the disease  dr donaldson glanced at margaret
her bent head her face raised with no appeal for a temporary reprieve showed that quick observer of human nature that she thought it better that the whole truth should be told
not the disease
we cannot touch the disease with all our poor vaunted skill
we can only delay its progressalleviate the pain it causes
be a man sira christian
have faith in the immortality of the soul which no pain no mortal disease can assail or touch  but all the reply he got was in the choked words you have never been married dr donaldson you dont know what it is and in the deep manly sobs which went through the stillness of the night like heavy pulses of agony
margaret knelt by him caressing him with tearful caresses
no one not even dr donaldson knew how the time went by
mr hale was the first to dare to speak of the necessities of the present moment
what must we do asked he
tell us both
margaret is my staffmy right hand  dr donaldson gave his clear sensible directions
no fear for tonightnay even peace for tomorrow and for many days yet
but no enduring hope of recovery
he advised mr hale to go to bed and leave only one to watch the slumber which he hoped would be undisturbed
he promised to come again early in the morning
and with a warm and kindly shake of the hand he left them
they spoke but few words they were too much exhausted by their terror to do more than decide upon the immediate course of action
mr hale was resolved to sit up through the night and all that margaret could do was to prevail upon him to rest on the drawingroom sofa
dixon stoutly and bluntly refused to go to bed and as for margaret it was simply impossible that she should leave her mother let all the doctors in the world speak of husbanding resources and one watcher only being required so dixon sat and stared and winked and drooped and picked herself up again with a jerk and finally gave up the battle and fairly snored
margaret had taken off her gown and tossed it aside with a sort of impatient disgust and put on her dressinggown
she felt as if she never could sleep again as if her whole senses were acutely vital and all endued with double keenness for the purpose of watching
every sight and soundnay even every thought touched some nerve to the very quick
for more than two hours she heard her fathers restless movements in the next room
he came perpetually to the door of her mothers chamber pausing there to listen till she not hearing his close unseen presence went and opened it to tell him how all went on in reply to the questions his baked lips could hardly form
at last he too fell asleep and all the house was still
margaret sat behind the curtain thinking
far away in time far away in space seemed all the interests of past days
not more than thirtysix hours ago she cared for bessy higgins and her father and her heart was wrung for boucher now that was all like a dreaming memory of some former lifeeverything that had passed out of doors seemed dissevered from her mother and therefore unreal
even harley street appeared more distinct there she remembered as if it were yesterday how she had pleased herself with tracing out her mothers features in her aunt shaws faceand how letters had come making her dwell on the thoughs of home with all the longing of love
helstone itself was in the dim past
the dull gray days of the preceding winter and spring so uneventless and monotonous seemed more associated with what she cared for now above all price
she would fain have caught at the skirts of that departing time and prayed it to return and give her back what she had too little valued while it was yet in her possession
what a vain show life seemed
how unsubstantial and flickering and flitting
it was as if from some arial belfry high up above the stir and jar of the earth there was a bell continually tolling all are shadowsall are passingall is past and when the morning dawned cool and gray like many a happier morning beforewhen margaret looked one by one at the sleepers it seemed as if the terrible night were unreal as a dream it too was a shadow
it too was past
mrs hale herself was not aware when she awoke how ill she had been the night before
she was rather surprised at dr donaldsons early visit and perplexed by the anxious faces of husband and child
she consented to remain in bed that day saying she certainly was tired but the next she insisted on getting up and dr donaldson gave his consent to her returning into the drawingroom
she was restless and uncomfortable in every position and before night she became very feverish
mr hale was utterly listless and incapable of deciding on anything
what can we do to spare mamma such another night asked margaret on the third day
it is to a certain degree the reaction after the powerful opiates i have been obliged to use
it is more painful for you to see than for her to bear i believe
but i think if we could get a waterbed it might be a good thing
not but what she will be better tomorrow pretty much like herself as she was before this attack
still i should like her to have a waterbed
mrs thornton has one i know
ill try and call there this afternoon
stay said he his eye catching on margarets face blanched with watching in a sick room im not sure whether i can go ive a long round to take
it would do you no harm to have a brisk walk to marlborough street and ask mrs thornton if she can spare it  certainly said margaret
i could go while mamma is asleep this afternoon
im sure mrs thornton would lend it to us  dr donaldsons experience told him rightly
mrs hale seemed to shake off the consequences of her attack and looked brighter and better this afternoon than margaret had ever hoped to see her again
her daughter left her after dinner sitting in her easy chair with her hand lying in her husbands who looked more worn and suffering than she by far
still he could smile nowrather slowly rather faintly it is true but a day or two before margaret never thought to see him smile again
it was about two miles from their house in crampton crescent to marlborough street
it was too hot to walk very quickly
an august sun beat straight down into the street at three oclock in the afternoon
margaret went along without noticing anything very different from usual in the first mile and a half of her journey she was absorbed in her own thoughts and had learnt by this time to thread her way through the irregular stream of human beings that flowed through milton streets
but by and by she was struck with an unusual heaving among the mass of people in the crowded road on which she was entering
they did not appear to be moving on so much as talking and listening and buzzing with excitement without much stirring from the spot where they might happen to be
still as they made way for her and wrapt up in the purpose of her errand and the necessities that suggested it she was less quick of observation than she might have been if her mind had been at ease
she had got into marlborough street before the full conviction forced itself upon her that there was a restless oppressive sense of irritation abroad among the people a thunderous atmosphere morally as well as physically around her
from every narrow lane opening out on marlborough street came up a low distant roar as of myriads of fierce indignant voices
the inhabitants of each poor squalid dwelling were gathered round the doors and windows if indeed they were not actually standing in the middle of the narrow waysall with looks intent towards one point
marlborough street itself was the focus of all those human eyes that betrayed intensest interest of various kinds some fierce with anger some lowering with relentless threats
some dilated with fear or imploring entreaty and as margaret reached the small sideentrance by the folding doors in the great dead wall of marlborough millyard and waited the porters answer to the bell she looked round and heard the first long faroff roll of the tempestsaw the first slowsurging wave of the dark crowd come with its threatening crest tumble over and retreat at the far end of the street which a moment ago seemed so full of repressed noise but which now was ominously still all these circumstances forced themselves on margarets notice but did not sink down into her preoccupied heart
she did not know what they meantwhat was their deep significance while she did know did feel the keen sharp pressure of the knife that was soon to stab her through and through by leaving her motherless
she was trying to realise that in order that when it came she might be ready to comfort her father
the porter opened the door cautiously not nearly wide enough to admit her
its you is it maam said he drawing a long breath and widening the entrance but still not opening it fully
margaret went in
he hastily bolted it behind her
th folk are all coming up here i reckon asked he
i dont know
something unusual seemed going on but this street is quite empty i think  she went across the yard and put up the steps to the house door
there was no near soundno steam engine at work with beat and pantno click of machinery no mingling and clashing of many sharp voices but far away the ominous gathering roar deepclamouring
a blow and its consequences
but work grew scarce while bread grew dear        and wages lessened too      for irish hordes were bidders here        our halfpaid work to do                        corn law rhymes
margaret was shown into the drawingroom
it had returned into its normal state of bag and covering
the windows were half open because of the heat and the venetian blinds covered the glassso that a gray grim light reflected from the pavement below threw all the shadows wrong and combined with the greentinged upper light to make even margarets own face as she caught it in the mirrors look ghastly and wan
she sat and waited no one came
every now and then the wind seemed to bear the distant multitudinous sound nearer and yet there was no wind
it died away into profound stillness between whiles
fanny came in at last
mamma will come directly miss hale
she desired me to apologise to you as it is
perhaps you know my brother has imported hands from ireland and it has irritated the milton people excessivelyas if he hadnt a right to get labour where he could and the stupid wretches here wouldnt work for him and now theyve frightened these poor irish starvelings so with their threats that we darent let them out
you may see them huddled in that top room in the milland theyre to sleep there to keep them safe from those brutes who will neither work or let them work
and mamma is seeing about their food and john is speaking to them for some of the women are crying to go back
ah
heres mamma  mrs thornton came in with a look of black sternness on her face which made margaret feel she had arrived at a bad time to trouble her with her request
however it was only in compliance with mrs thorntons expressed desire that she would ask for whatever they might want in the progress of her mothers illness
mrs thorntons brow contracted and her mouth grew set while margaret spoke with gentle modesty of her mothers restlessness and dr donaldsons wish that she should have the relief of a waterbed
she ceased
mrs thornton did not reply immediately
then she started up and exclaimed  theyre at the gates
call john fannycall him in from the mill
theyre at the gates
theyll batter them in
call john i say  and simultaneously the gathering trampto which she had been listening instead of heeding margarets wordswas heard just right outside the wall and an increasing din of angry voices raged behind the wooden barrier which shook as if the unseen maddened crowd made battering rams of their bodies and retreated a short space only to come with more united steady impetus against it till their great beats made the strong gates quiver like reeds before the wind
the women gathered round the windows fascinated to look on the scene which terrified them
mrs thornton the womenservants margaretall were there
fanny had returned screaming upstairs as if pursued at every step and had thrown herself in hysterical sobbing on the sofa
mrs thornton watched for her son who was still in the mill
he came out looked up at themthe pale cluster of facesand smiled good courage to them before he locked the factory door
then he called to one of the women to come down and undo his own door which fanny had fastened behind her in her mad flight
mrs thornton herself went
and the sound of his wellknown and commanding voice seemed to have been like the taste of blood to the infuriated multitude outside
hitherto they had been voiceless wordless needing all their breath for their hardlaboured efforts to break down the gates
but now hearing him speak inside they set up such a fierce unearthly groan that even mrs thornton was white with fear as she preceded him into the room
he came in a little flushed but his eyes gleamed as in answer to the trumpetcall of danger and with a proud look of defiance on his face that made him a noble if not a handsome man
margaret had always dreaded lest her courage should fail her in any emergency and she should be proved to be what she dreaded lest she wasa coward
but now in this real great time of reasonable fear and nearness of terror she forgot herself and felt only an intense sympathyintense to painfulnessin the interests of the moment
mr thornton came frankly forwards  im sorry miss hale you have visited us at this unfortunate moment when i fear you may be involved in whatever risk we have to bear
mother
hadnt you better go into the back rooms
im not sure whether they may not have made their way from pinners lane into the stableyard but if not you will be safer there than here
go jane continued he addressing the upperservant
and she went followed by the others
i stop here said his mother
where you are there i stay and indeed retreat into the back rooms was of no avail the crowd had surrounded the outbuildings at the rear and were sending forth their awful threatening roar behind
the servants retreated into the garrets with many a cry and shriek
mr thornton smiled scornfully as he heard them
he glanced at margaret standing all by herself at the window nearest the factory
her eyes glittered her colour was deepened on cheek and lip
as if she felt his look she turned to him and asked a question that had been for some time in her mind  where are the poor imported workpeople
in the factory there  yes
i left them cowed up in a small room at the head of a back flight of stairs bidding them run all risks and escape down there if they heard any attack made on the mill doors
but it is not themit is me they want  when can the soldiers be here asked his mother in a low but not unsteady voice
he took out his watch with the same steady composure with which he did everything
he made some little calculation  supposing williams got straight off when i told him and hadnt to dodge about amongst themit must be twenty minutes yet  twenty minutes said his mother for the first time showing her terror in the tones of her voice
shut down the windows instantly mother exclaimed he the gates wont bear such another shock
shut down that window miss hale  margaret shut down her window and then went to assist mrs thorntons trembling fingers
from some cause or other there was a pause of several minutes in the unseen street
mrs thornton looked with wild anxiety at her sons countenance as if to gain the interpretation of the sudden stillness from him
his face was set into rigid lines of contemptuous defiance neither hope nor fear could be read there
fanny raised herself up  are they gone asked she in a whisper
gone replied he
listen  she did listen they all could hear the one great straining breath the creak of wood slowly yielding the wrench of iron the mighty fall of the ponderous gates
fanny stood up totteringmade a step or two towards her mother and fell forwards into her arms in a fainting fit
mrs thornton lifted her up with a strength that was as much that of the will as of the body and carried her away
thank god said mr thornton as he watched her out
had you not better go upstairs miss hale  margarets lips formed a nobut he could not hear her speak for the tramp of innumerable steps right under the very wall of the house and the fierce growl of low deep angry voices that had a ferocious murmur of satisfaction in them more dreadful than their baffled cries not many minutes before
never mind said he thinking to encourage her
i am very sorry that you should have been entrapped into all this alarm but it cannot last long now a few minutes more and the soldiers will be here  oh god cried margaret suddenly there is boucher
i know his face though he is livid with ragehe is fighting to get to the frontlook
look  who is boucher asked mr thornton coolly and coming close to the window to discover the man in whom margaret took such an interest
as soon as they saw mr thornton they set up a yell to call it not human is nothingit was as the demoniac desire of some terrible wild beast for the food that is withheld from his ravening
even he drew back for a moment dismayed at the intensity of hatred he had provoked
let them yell said he
in five minutes more
i only hope my poor irishmen are not terrified out of their wits by such a fiendlike noise
keep up your courage for five minutes miss hale  dont be afraid for me she said hastily
but what in five minutes
can you do nothing to soothe these poor creatures
it is awful to see them  the soldiers will be here directly and that will bring them to reason  to reason said margaret quickly
what kind of reason  the only reason that does with men that make themselves into wild beasts
by heaven
theyve turned to the milldoor  mr
thornton said margaret shaking all over with her passion go down this instant if you are not a coward
go down and face them like a man
save these poor strangers whom you have decoyed here
speak to your workmen as if they were human beings
speak to them kindly
dont let the soldiers come in and cut down poor creatures who are driven mad
i see one there who is
if you have any courage or noble quality in you go out and speak to them man to man  he turned and looked at her while she spoke
a dark cloud came over his face while he listened
he set his teeth as he heard her words
i will go
perhaps i may ask you to accompany me downstairs and bar the door behind me my mother and sister will need that protection  oh
mr thornton
i do not knowi may be wrongonly  but he was gone he was downstairs in the hall he had unbarred the front door all she could do was to follow him quickly and fasten it behind him and clamber up the stairs again with a sick heart and a dizzy head
again she took her place by the farthest window
he was on the steps below she saw that by the direction of a thousand angry eyes but she could neither see nor hear anything save the savage satisfaction of the rolling angry murmur
see threw the window wide open
many in the crowd were mere boys cruel and thoughtlesscruel because they were thoughtless some were men gaunt as wolves and mad for prey
she knew how it was they were like boucherwith starving children at homerelying on ultimate success in their efforts to get higher wages and enraged beyond measure at discovering that irishmen were to be brought in to rob their little ones of bread
margaret knew it all she read it in bouchers face forlornly desperate and livid with rage
if mr thornton would but say something to themlet them hear his voice onlyit seemed as if it would be better than this wild beating and raging against the stony silence that vouchsafed them no word even of anger or reproach
but perhaps he was speaking now there was a momentary hush of their noise inarticulate as that of a troop of animals
she tore her bonnet off and bent forward to hear
she could only see for if mr thornton had indeed made the attempt to speak the momentary instinct to listen to him was past and gone and the people were raging worse than ever
he stood with his arms folded still as a statue his face pale with repressed excitement
they were trying to intimidate himto make him flinch each was urging the other on to some immediate act of personal violence
margaret felt intuitively that in an instant all would be uproar the first touch would cause an explosion in which among such hundreds of infuriated men and reckless boys even mr thorntons life would be unsafethat in another instant the stormy passions would have passed their bounds and swept away all barriers of reason or apprehension of consequence
even while she looked she saw lads in the background stooping to take off their heavy wooden clogsthe readiest missile they could find she saw it was the spark to the gunpowder and with a cry which no one heard she rushed out of the room down stairsshe had lifted the great iron bar of the door with an imperious forcehad thrown the door open wideand was there in face of that angry sea of men her eyes smiting them with flaming arrows of reproach
the clogs were arrested in the hands that held themthe countenances so fell not a moment before now looked irresolute and as if asking what this meant
for she stood between them and their enemy
she could not speak but held out her arms towards them till she could recover breath
oh do not use violence
he is one man and you are many but her words died away for there was no tone in her voice it was but a hoarse whisper
mr thornton stood a little on one side he had moved away from behind her as if jealous of anything that should come between him and danger
go said she once more and now her voice was like a cry
the soldiers are sent forare coming
go peaceably
go away
you shall have relief from your complaints whatever they are  shall them irish blackguards be packed back again asked one from out the crowd with fierce threatening in his voice
never for your bidding exclaimed mr thornton
and instantly the storm broke
the hootings rose and filled the airbut margaret did not hear them
her eye was on the group of lads who had armed themselves with their clogs some time before
she saw their gestureshe knew its meaningshe read their aim
another moment and mr thornton might be smitten downhe whom she had urged and goaded to come to this perilous place
she only thought how she could save him
she threw her arms around him she made her body into a shield from the fierce people beyond
still with his arms folded he shook her off
go away said he in his deep voice
this is no place for you  it is said she
you did not see what i saw if she thought her sex would be a protectionif with shrinking eyes she had turned away from the terrible anger of these men in any hope that ere she looked again they would have paused and reflected and slunk away and vanishedshe was wrong
their reckless passion had carried them too far to stopat least had carried some of them too far for it is always the savage lads with their love of cruel excitement who head the riotreckless to what bloodshed it may lead
a clog whizzed through the air
margarets fascinated eyes watched its progress it missed its aim and she turned sick with affright but changed not her position only hid her face on mr thorntons arm
then she turned and spoke again  for gods sake
do not damage your cause by this violence
you do not know what you are doing she strove to make her words distinct
a sharp pebble flew by her grazing forehead and cheek and drawing a blinding sheet of light before her eyes
she lay like one dead on mr thorntons shoulder
then he unfolded his arms and held her encircled in one for an instant  you do well said he
you come to oust the innocent stranger
you fallyou hundredson one man and when a woman comes before you to ask you for your own sakes to be reasonable creatures your cowardly wrath falls upon her
you do well they were silent while he spoke
they were watching openeyed and openmouthed the thread of darkred blood which wakened them up from their trance of passion
those nearest the gate stole out ashamed there was a movement through all the crowda retreating movement
only one voice called out  th stone was meant for thee but thou wert sheltered behind a woman  mr thornton quivered with rage
the bloodflowing had made margaret consciousdimly vaguely conscious
he placed her gently on the doorstep her head leaning against the frame
can you rest there he asked
but without waiting for her answer he went slowly down the steps right into the middle of the crowd
now kill me if it is your brutal will
there is no woman to shield me here
you may beat me to deathyou will never move me from what i have determined uponnot you he stood amongst them with his arms folded in precisely the same attitude as he had been in on the steps
but the retrograde movement towards the gate had begunas unreasoningly perhaps as blindly as the simultaneous anger
or perhaps the idea of the approach of the soldiers and the sight of that pale upturned face with closed eyes still and sad as marble though the tears welled out of the long entanglement of eyelashes and dropped down and heavier slower plash than even tears came the drip of blood from her wound
even the most desperateboucher himselfdrew back faltered away scowled and finally went off muttering curses on the master who stood in his unchanging attitude looking after their retreat with defiant eyes
the moment that retreat had changed into a flight as it was sure from its very character to do he darted up the steps to margaret
she tried to rise without his help
it is nothing she said with a sickly smile
the skin is grazed and i was stunned at the moment
oh i am so thankful they are gone and she cried without restraint
he could not sympathise with her
his anger had not abated it was rising the more as his sense of immediate danger was passing away
the distant clank of the soldiers was heard just five minutes too late to make this vanished mob feel the power of authority and order
he hoped they would see the troops and be quelled by the thought of their narrow escape
while these thoughts crossed his mind margaret clung to the doorpost to steady herself but a film came over her eyeshe was only just in time to catch her
mothermother cried he come downthey are gone and miss hale is hurt he bore her into the diningroom and laid her on the sofa there laid her down softly and looking on her pure white face the sense of what she was to him came upon him so keenly that he spoke it out in his pain  oh my margaretmy margaret
no one can tell what you are to me
deadcold as you lie there you are the only woman i ever loved
oh margaretmargaret  inarticulately as he spoke kneeling by her and rather moaning than saying the words he started up ashamed of himself as his mother came in
she saw nothing but her son a little paler a little sterner than usual
miss hale is hurt mother
a stone has grazed her temple
she has lost a good deal of blood im afraid  she looks very seriously hurti could almost fancy her dead said mrs thornton a good deal alarmed
it is only a faintingfit
she has spoken to me since but all the blood in his body seemed to rush inwards to his heart as he spoke and he absolutely trembled
go and call janeshe can find me the things i want and do you go to your irish people who are crying and shouting as if they were mad with fright  he went
he went away as if weights were tied to every limb that bore him from her
he called jane he called his sister
she should have all womanly care all gentle tendance
but every pulse beat in him as he remembered how she had come down and placed herself in foremost dangercould it be to save him
at the time he had pushed her aside and spoken gruffly he had seen nothing but the unnecessary danger she had placed herself in
he went to his irish people with every nerve in his body thrilling at the thought of her and found it difficult to understand enough of what they were saying to soothe and comfort away their fears
there they declared they would not stop they claimed to be sent back
and so he had to think and talk and reason
mrs thornton bathed margarets temples with eau de cologne
as the spirit touched the wound which till then neither mrs thornton nor jane had perceived margaret opened her eyes but it was evident she did not know where she was nor who they were
the dark circles deepened the lips quivered and contracted and she became insensible once more
she has had a terrible blow said mrs thornton
is there any one who will go for a doctor  not me maam if you please said jane shrinking back
them rabble may be all about i dont think the cut is so deep maam as it looks  i will not run the chance
she was hurt in our house
if you are a coward jane i am not
i will go  pray maam let me send one of the police
theres ever so many come up and soldiers too  and yet youre afraid to go
i will not have their time taken up with our errands
theyll have enough to do to catch some of the mob
you will not be afraid to stop in this house she asked contemptuously and go on bathing miss hales forehead shall you
i shall not be ten minutes away  couldnt hannah go maam  why hannah
why any but you
no jane if you dont go i do  mrs thornton went first to the room in which she had left fanny stretched on the bed
she started up as her mother entered
oh mamma how you terrified me
i thought you were a man that had got into the house  nonsense
the men are all gone away
there are soldiers all round the place seeking for their work now it is too late
miss hale is lying on the diningroom sofa badly hurt
i am going for the doctor  oh
dont mamma
theyll murder you she clung to her mothers gown
mrs thornton wrenched it away with no gentle hand
find me some one else to go but that girl must not bleed to death  bleed
oh how horrid
how has she got hurt  i dont knowi have no time to ask
go down to her fanny and do try to make yourself of use
jane is with her and i trust it looks worse than it is
jane has refused to leave the house cowardly woman
and i wont put myself in the way of any more refusals from my servants so i am going myself  oh dear dear said fanny crying and preparing to go down rather than be left alone with the thought of wounds and bloodshed in the very house
oh jane said she creeping into the diningroom what is the matter
how white she looks
how did she get hurt
did they throw stones into the drawingroom  margaret did indeed look white and wan although her senses were beginning to return to her
but the sickly daze of the swoon made her still miserably faint
she was conscious of movement around her and of refreshment from the eau de cologne and a craving for the bathing to go on without intermission but when they stopped to talk she could no more have opened her eyes or spoken to ask for more bathing than the people who lie in deathlike trance can move or utter sound to arrest the awful preparations for their burial while they are yet fully aware not merely of the actions of those around them but of the idea that is the motive for such actions
jane paused in her bathing to reply to miss thorntons question
shed have been safe enough miss if shed stayed in the drawingroom or come up to us we were in the front garret and could see it all out of harms way  where was she then said fanny drawing nearer by slow degrees as she became accustomed to the sight of margarets pale face
just before the front doorwith master said jane significantly
with john
with my brother
how did she get there  nay miss thats not for me to say answered jane with a slight toss of her head
sarah did  sarah what said fanny with impatient curiosity
jane resumed her bathing as if what sarah did or said was not exactly the thing she liked to repeat
sarah what asked fanny sharply
dont speak in these half sentences or i cant understand you  well miss since you will have itsarah you see was in the best place for seeing being at the righthand window and she says and said at the very time too that she saw miss hale with her arms about masters neck hugging him before all the people  i dont believe it said fanny
i know she cares for my brother any one can see that and i dare say shed give her eyes if hed marry herwhich he never will i can tell her
but i dont believe shed be so bold and forward as to put her arms round his neck  poor young lady
shes paid for it dearly if she did
its my belief that the blow has given her such an ascendancy of blood to the head as shell never get the better from
she looks like a corpse now  oh i wish mamma would come said fanny wringing her hands
i never was in the room with a dead person before  stay miss
shes not dead her eyelids are quivering and heres wet tears acoming down her cheeks
speak to her miss fanny  are you better now asked fanny in a quavering voice
no answer no sign of recognition but a faint pink colour returned to her lips although the rest of her face was ashen pale
mrs thornton came hurriedly in with the nearest surgeon she could find
how is she
are you better my dear as margaret opened her filmy eyes and gazed dreamily at her
here is mr lowe come to see you  mrs thornton spoke loudly and distinctly as to a deaf person
margaret tried to rise and drew her ruffled luxuriant hair instinctively over the cut
i am better now said she in a very low faint voice
i was a little sick  she let him take her hand and feel her pulse
the bright colour came for a moment into her face when he asked to examine the wound in her forehead and she glanced up at jane as if shrinking from her inspection more than from the doctors
it is not much i think
i am better now
i must go home  not until i have applied some strips of plaster and you have rested a little  she sat down hastily without another word and allowed it to be bound up
now if you please said she i must go
mamma will not see it i think
it is under the hair is it not  quite no one could tell  but you must not go said mrs thornton impatiently
you are not fit to go  i must said margaret decidedly
think of mamma
if they should hear besides i must go said she vehemently
i cannot stay here
may i ask for a cab  you are quite flushed and feverish observed mr lowe
it is only with being here when i do so want to go
the airgetting away would do me more good than anything pleaded she
i really believe it is as she says mr lowe replied
if her mother is so ill as you told me on the way here it may be very serious if she hears of this riot and does not see her daughter back at the time she expects
the injury is not deep
i will fetch a cab if your servants are still afraid to go out  oh thank you said margaret
it will do me more good than anything
it is the air of this room that makes me feel so miserable  she leant back on the sofa and closed her eyes
fanny beckoned her mother out of the room and told her something that made her equally anxious with margaret for the departure of the latter
not that she fully believed fannys statement but she credited enough to make her manner to margaret appear very much constrained at wishing her goodbye
mr lowe returned in the cab
if you will allow me i will see you home miss hale
the streets are not very quiet yet  margarets thoughts were quite alive enough to the present to make her desirous of getting rid of both mr lowe and the cab before she reached crampton crescent for fear of alarming her father and mother
beyond that one aim she would not look
that ugly dream of insolent words spoken about herself could never be forgottenbut could be put aside till she was strongerfor oh
she was very weak and her mind sought for some present fact to steady itself upon and keep it from utterly losing consciousness in another hideous sickly swoon
mistakes
which when his mother saw she in her mind     was troubled sore he wist well what to ween               spenser
margaret had not been gone five minutes when mr thornton came in his face all aglow
i could not come sooner the superintendent would where is she he looked round the diningroom and then almost fiercely at his mother who was quietly rearranging the disturbed furniture and did not instantly reply
where is miss hale asked he again
gone home said she rather shortly
gone home  yes
she was a great deal better
indeed i dont believe it was so very much of a hurt only some people faint at the least thing  i am sorry she has gone home said he walking uneasily about
she could not have been fit for it  she said she was and mr lowe said she was
i went for him myself  thank you mother he stopped and partly held out his hand to give her a grateful shake
but she did not notice the movement
what have you done with your irish people  sent to the dragon for a good meal for them poor wretches
and then luckily i caught father grady and ive asked him in to speak to them and dissuade them from going off in a body
how did miss hale go home
im sure she could not walk  she had a cab
everything was done properly even to the paying
let us talk of something else
she has caused disturbance enough  i dont know where i should have been but for her  are you become so helpless as to have to be defended by a girl asked mrs thornton scornfully
he reddened
not many girls would have taken the blows on herself which were meant for memeant with right down goodwill too  a girl in love will do a good deal replied mrs thornton shortly
mother he made a step forwards stood still heaved with passion
she was a little startled at the evident force he used to keep himself calm
she was not sure of the nature of the emotions she had provoked
it was only their violence that was clear
was it anger
his eyes glowed his figure was dilated his breath came thick and fast
it was a mixture of joy of anger of pride of glad surprise of panting doubt but she could not read it
still it made her uneasyas the presence of all strong feeling of which the cause is not fully understood or sympathised in always has this effect
she went to the sideboard opened a drawer and took out a duster which she kept there for any occasional purpose
she had seen a drop of eau de cologne on the polished arm of the sofa and instinctively sought to wipe it off
but she kept her back turned to her son much longer than was necessary and when she spoke her voice seemed unusual and constrained
you have taken some steps about the rioters i suppose
you dont apprehend anymore violence do you
where were the police
never at hand when theyre wanted  on the contrary i saw three or four of them when the gates gave way struggling and beating about in fine fashion and more came running up just when the yard was clearing
i might have given some of the fellows in charge then if i had had my wits about me
but there will be no difficulty plenty of people can identify them  but wont they come back tonight  im going to see about a sufficient guard for the premises
i have appointed to meet captain hanbury in half an hour at the station  you must have some tea first  tea
yes i suppose i must
its halfpast six and i may be out for some time
dont sit up for me mother  you expect me to go to bed before i have seen you safe do you  well perhaps not he hesitated for a moment
but if ive time i shall go round by crampton after ive arranged with the police and seen hamper and clarkson their eyes met they looked at each other intently for a minute
then she asked  why are you going round by crampton  to ask after miss hale  i will send
williams must take the waterbed she came to ask for
he shall inquire how she is  i must go myself  not merely to ask how miss hale is  no not merely for that
i want to thank her for the way in which she stood between me and the mob  what made you go down at all
it was putting your head into the lions mouth  he glanced sharply at her saw that she did not know what had passed between him and margaret in the drawingroom and replied by another question  shall you be afraid to be left without me until i can get some of the police or had we better send williams for them now and they could be here by the time we have done tea
theres no time to be lost
i must be off in a quarter of an hour  mrs thornton left the room
her servants wondered at her directions usually so sharplycut and decided now confused and uncertain
mr thornton remained in the diningroom trying to think of the business he had to do at the policeoffice and in reality thinking of margaret
everything seemed dim and vague beyondbehindbesides the touch of her arms round his neckthe soft clinging which made the dark colour come and go in his cheek as he thought of it
the tea would have been very silent but for fannys perpetual description of her own feelings how she had been alarmedand then thought they were goneand then felt sick and faint and trembling in every limb
there thats enough said her brother rising from the table
the reality was enough for me he was going to leave the room when his mother stopped him with her hand upon his arm
you will come back here before you go to the hales said she in a low anxious voice
i know what i know said fanny to herself
why
will it be too late to disturb them  john come back to me for this one evening
it will be late for mrs hale
but that is not it
tomorrow you will come back tonight john she had seldom pleaded with her son at allshe was too proud for that but she had never pleaded in vain
i will return straight here after i have done my business
you will be sure to enquire after themafter her  mrs thornton was by no means a talkative companion to fanny nor yet a good listener while her son was absent
but on his return her eyes and ears were keen to see and to listen to all the details which he could give as to the steps he had taken to secure himself and those whom he chose to employ from any repetition of the days outrages
he clearly saw his object
punishment and suffering were the natural consequences to those who had taken part in the riot
all that was necessary in order that property should be protected and that the will of the proprietor might cut to his end clean and sharp as a sword
mother
you know what i have got to say to miss hale tomorrow  the question came upon her suddenly during a pause in which she at least had forgotten margaret
she looked up at him
yes
i do
you can hardly do otherwise  do otherwise
i dont understand you  i mean that after allowing her feelings so to overcome her i consider you bound in honour  bound in honour said he scornfully
im afraid honour has nothing to do with it
her feelings overcome her what feelings do you mean  nay john there is no need to be angry
did she not rush down and cling to you to save you from danger  she did said he
but mother continued he stopping short in his walk right in front of her
i dare not hope
i never was fainthearted before but i cannot believe such a creature cares for me  dont be foolish john
such a creature
why she might be a dukes daughter to hear you speak
and what proof more would you have i wonder of her caring for you
i can believe she has had a struggle with her aristocratic way of viewing things but i like her the better for seeing clearly at last
it is a good deal for me to say said mrs thornton smiling slowly while the tears stood in her eyes for after tonight i stand second
it was to have you to myself all to myself a few hours longer that i begged you not to go till tomorrow  dearest mother still love is selfish and in an instant he reverted to his own hopes and fears in a way that drew the cold creeping shadow over mrs thorntons heart
but i know she does not care for me
i shall put myself at her feeti must
if it were but one chance in a thousandor a millioni should do it  dont fear said his mother crushing down her own personal mortification at the little notice he had taken of the rare ebullition of her maternal feelingsof the pang of jealousy that betrayed the intensity of her disregarded love
dont be afraid she said coldly
as far as love may go she may be worthy of you
it must have taken a good deal to overcome her pride
dont be afraid john said she kissing him as she wished him goodnight
and she went slowly and majestically out of the room
but when she got into her own she locked the door and sate down to cry unwonted tears
                              margaret entered the room where her father and mother still sat holding low conversation together looking very pale and white
she came close up to them before she could trust herself to speak
mrs
thornton will send the waterbed mamma  dear how tired you look
is it very hot margaret  very hot and the streets are rather rough with the strike  margarets colour came back vivid and bright as ever but it faded away instantly
here has been a message from bessy higgins asking you to go to her said mrs hale
but im sure you look too tired  yes said margaret
i am tired i cannot go  she was very silent and trembling while she made tea
she was thankful to see her father so much occupied with her mother as not to notice her looks
even after her mother went to bed he was not content to be absent from her but undertook to read her to sleep
margaret was alone
now i will think of itnow i will remember it all
i could not beforei dared not she sat still in her chair her hands clasped on her knees her lips compressed her eyes fixed as one who sees a vision
she drew a deep breath
i who hate scenesi who have despised people for showing emotionwho have thought them wanting in selfcontroli went down and must needs throw myself into the mele like a romantic fool
did i do any good
they would have gone away without me i dare say but this was overleaping the rational conclusionas in an instant her wellpoised judgment felt
no perhaps they would not
i did some good
but what possessed me to defend that man as if he were a helpless child
ah said she clenching her hands together it is no wonder those people thought i was in love with him after disgracing myself in that way
i in loveand with him too her pale cheeks suddenly became one flame of fire and she covered her face with her hands
when she took them away her palms were wet with scalding tears
oh how low i am fallen that they should say that of me
i could not have been so brave for any one else just because he was so utterly indifferent to meif indeed i do not positively dislike him
it made me the more anxious that there should be fair play on each side and i could see what fair play was
it was not fair said she vehemently that he should stand theresheltered awaiting the soldiers who might catch those poor maddened creatures as in a trapwithout an effort on his part to bring them to reason
and it was worse than unfair for them to set on him as they threatened
i would do it again let who will say what they like of me
if i saved one blow one cruel angry action that might otherwise have been committed i did a womans work
let them insult my maiden pride as they willi walk pure before god  she looked up and a noble peace seemed to descend and calm her face till it was stiller than chiselled marble  dixon came in  if you please miss margaret heres the waterbed from mrs thorntons
its too late for tonight im afraid for missus is nearly asleep but it will do nicely for tomorrow  very said margaret
you must send our best thanks  dixon left the room for a moment
if you please miss margaret he says hes to ask particular how you are
i think he must mean missus but he says his last words were to ask how miss hale was  me said margaret drawing herself up
i am quite well
tell him i am perfectly well but her complexion was as deadly white as her handkerchief and her head ached intensely
mr hale now came in
he had left his sleeping wife and wanted as margaret saw to be amused and interested by something that she was to tell him
with sweet patience did she bear her pain without a word of complaint and rummaged up numberless small subjects for conversationall except the riot and that she never named once
it turned her sick to think of it
goodnight margaret
i have every chance of a good night myself and you are looking very pale with your watching
i shall call dixon if your mother needs anything
do you go to bed and sleep like a top for im sure you need it poor child  goodnight papa  she let her colour gothe false smile fade awaythe eyes grow dull with heavy pain
she released her strong will from its laborious task
till morning she might feel ill and weary
she lay down and never stirred
to move hand or foot or even so much as one finger would have been beyond the powers of either volition or motion
she was so tired so stunned that she thought she never slept at all her feverish thoughts passed and repassed the boundary between sleeping and waking and kept their own miserable identity
she could not be alone prostrate powerless as she wasa cloud of faces looked up at her giving her no idea of fierce vivid anger or of personal danger but a deep sense of shame that she should thus be the object of universal regarda sense of shame so acute that it seemed as if she would fain have burrowed into the earth to hide herself and yet she could not escape out of that unwinking glare of many eyes
mistakes cleared up
your beauty was the first that won the place     and scald the walls of my undaunted heart       which captive now pines in a caitive case     unkindly met with rigour for desert       yet not the less your servant shall abide       in spite of rude repulse or silent pride               william fowler
the next morning margaret dragged herself up thankful that the night was overunrefreshed yet rested
all had gone well through the house her mother had only wakened once
a little breeze was stirring in the hot air and though there were no trees to show the playful tossing movement caused by the wind among the leaves margaret knew how somewhere or another by wayside in copses or in thick green woods there was a pleasant murmuring dancing sounda rushing and falling noise the very thought of which was an echo of distinct gladness in her heart
she sat at her work in mrs hales room
as soon as that forenoon slumber was over she would help her mother to dress after dinner she would go and see bessy higgins
she would banish all recollection of the thornton familyno need to think of them till they absolutely stood before her in flesh and blood
but of course the effort not to think of them brought them only the more strongly before her and from time to time the hot flush came over her pale face sweeping it into colour as a sunbeam from between watery clouds comes swiftly moving over the sea
dixon opened the door very softly and stole on tiptoe up to margaret sitting by the shaded window
mr
thornton miss margaret
he is in the drawingroom  margaret dropped her sewing
did he ask for me
isnt papa come in  he asked for you miss and master is out  very well i will come said margaret quietly
but she lingered strangely
mr thornton stood by one of the windows with his back to the door apparently absorbed in watching something in the street
but in truth he was afraid of himself
his heart beat thick at the thought of her coming
he could not forget the touch of her arms around his neck impatiently felt as it had been at the time but now the recollection of her clinging defence of him seemed to thrill him through and throughto melt away every resolution all power of selfcontrol as if it were wax before a fire
he dreaded lest he should go forwards to meet her with his arms held out in mute entreaty that she would come and nestle there as she had done all unheeded the day before but never unheeded again
his heart throbbed loud and quick
strong man as he was he trembled at the anticipation of what he had to say and how it might be received
she might droop and flush and flutter to his arms as to her natural home and restingplace
one moment he glowed with impatience at the thought that she might do thisthe next he feared a passionate rejection the idea of which withered up his future with so deadly a blight that he refused to think of it
he was startled by the sense of the presence of some one else in the room
he turned round
she had come in so gently that he had never heard her the street noises had been more distinct to his inattentive ear than her slow movements in her soft muslin gown
she stood by the table not offering to sit down
her eyelids were dropped half over her eyes her teeth were shut not compressed her lips were just parted over them allowing the white line to be seen between their curve
her slow deep breathings dilated her chin and beautiful nostrils it was the only motion visible on her countenance
the finegrained skin the oval cheek the rich outline of her mouth its corners deep set in dimpleswere all wan and pale today the loss of their usual natural healthy colour being made more evident by the heavy shadow of the dark hair brought down upon her temples to hide all sign of the blow she had received
her head for all its drooping eyes was thrown a little back in the old proud attitude
her long arms hung motionless by her sides
altogether she looked like some prisoner falsely accused of a crime that she loathed and despised and from which she was too indignant to justify herself
mr thornton made a hasty step or two forwards recovered himself and went with quiet firmness to the door which she had left open and shut it
then he came back and stood opposite to her for a moment receiving the general impression of her beautiful presence before he dared to disturb it perhaps to repel it by what he had to say
miss hale i was very ungrateful yesterday  you had nothing to be grateful for said she raising her eyes and looking full and straight at him
you mean i suppose that you believe you ought to thank me for what i did in spite of herselfin defiance of her angerthe thick blushes came all over her face and burnt into her very eyes which fell not nevertheless from their grave and steady look
it was only a natural instinct any woman would have done just the same
we all feel the sanctity of our sex as a high privilege when we see danger
i ought rather said she hastily to apologise to you for having said thoughtless words which sent you down into the danger  it was not your words it was the truth they conveyed pungently as it was expressed
but you shall not drive me off upon that and so escape the expression of my deep gratitude my he was on the verge now he would not speak in the haste of his hot passion he would weigh each word
he would and his will was triumphant
he stopped in mid career
i do not try to escape from anything said she
i simply say that you owe me no gratitude and i may add that any expression of it will be painful to me because i do not feel that i deserve it
still if it will relieve you from even a fancied obligation speak on  i do not want to be relieved from any obligation said he goaded by her calm manner
fancied or not fanciedi question not myself to know whichi choose to believe that i owe my very life to youaysmile and think it an exaggeration if you will
i believe it because it adds a value to that life to thinkoh miss hale continued he lowering his voice to such a tender intensity of passion that she shivered and trembled before him to think circumstances so wrought that whenever i exult in existence henceforward i may say to myself all this gladness in life all honest pride in doing my work in the world all this keen sense of being i owe to her and it doubles the gladness it makes the pride glow it sharpens the sense of existence till i hardly know if it is pain or pleasure to think that i owe it to onenay you must you shall hearsaid he stepping forward with stern determinationto one whom i love as i do not believe man ever loved woman before he held her hand tight in his
he panted as he listened for what should come
he threw the hand away with indignation as he heard her icy tone for icy it was though the words came faltering out as if she knew not where to find them
your way of speaking shocks me
it is blasphemous
i cannot help it if that is my first feeling
it might not be so i dare say if i understood the kind of feeling you describe
i do not want to vex you and besides we must speak gently for mamma is asleep but your whole manner offends me  how exclaimed he
offends you
i am indeed most unfortunate  yes said she with recovered dignity
i do feel offended and i think justly
you seem to fancy that my conduct of yesterdayagain the deep carnation blush but this time with eyes kindling with indignation rather than shamewas a personal act between you and me and that you may come and thank me for it instead of perceiving as a gentleman wouldyes
a gentleman she repeated in allusion to their former conversation about that word that any woman worthy of the name of woman would come forward to shield with her reverenced helplessness a man in danger from the violence of numbers  and the gentleman thus rescued is forbidden the relief of thanks he broke in contemptuously
i am a man
i claim the right of expressing my feelings  and i yielded to the right simply saying that you gave me pain by insisting upon it she replied proudly
but you seem to have imagined that i was not merely guided by womanly instinct butand here the passionate tears kept down for longstruggled with vehemently came up into her eyes and choked her voicebut that i was prompted by some particular feeling for youyou
why there was not a mannot a poor desperate man in all that crowdfor whom i had not more sympathyfor whom i should not have done what little i could more heartily  you may speak on miss hale
i am aware of these misplaced sympathies of yours
i now believe that it was only your innate sense of oppressionyes i though a master may be oppressedthat made you act so nobly as you did
i know you despise me allow me to say it is because you do not understand me  i do not care to understand she replied taking hold of the table to steady herself for she thought him cruelas indeed he wasand she was weak with her indignation
no i see you do not
you are unfair and unjust  margaret compressed her lips
she would not speak in answer to such accusations
but for all thatfor all his savage words he could have thrown himself at her feet and kissed the hem of her garment
she did not speak she did not move
the tears of wounded pride fell hot and fast
he waited awhile longing for her to say something even a taunt to which he might reply
but she was silent
he took up his hat
one word more
you look as if you thought it tainted you to be loved by me
you cannot avoid it
nay i if i would cannot cleanse you from it
but i would not if i could
i have never loved any woman before my life has been too busy my thoughts too much absorbed with other things
now i love and will love
but do not be afraid of too much expression on my part  i am not afraid she replied lifting herself straight up
no one yet has ever dared to be impertinent to me and no one ever shall
but mr thornton you have been very kind to my father said she changing her whole tone and bearing to a most womanly softness
dont let us go on making each other angry
pray dont he took no notice of her words he occupied himself in smoothing the nap of his hat with his coatsleeve for half a minute or so and then rejecting her offered hand and making as if he did not see her grave look of regret he turned abruptly away and left the room
margaret caught one glance at his face before he went
when he was gone she thought she had seen the gleam of washed tears in his eyes and that turned her proud dislike into something different and kinder if nearly as painfulselfreproach for having caused such mortification to any one
but how could i help it asked she of herself
i never liked him
i was civil but i took no trouble to conceal my indifference
indeed i never thought about myself or him so my manners must have shown the truth
all that yesterday he might mistake
but that is his fault not mine
i would do it again if need were though it does lead me into all this shame and trouble      frederick
revenge may have her own     roused discipline aloud proclaims their cause     and injured navies urge their broken laws               byron
margaret began to wonder whether all offers were as unexpected beforehandas distressing at the time of their occurrence as the two she had had
an involuntary comparison between mr lennox and mr thornton arose in her mind
she had been sorry that an expression of any other feeling than friendship had been lured out by circumstances from henry lennox
that regret was the predominant feeling on the first occasion of her receiving a proposal
she had not felt so stunnedso impressed as she did now when echoes of mr thorntons voice yet lingered about the room
in lennoxs case he seemed for a moment to have slid over the boundary between friendship and love and the instant afterwards to regret it nearly as much as she did although for different reasons
in mr thorntons case as far as margaret knew there was no intervening stage of friendship
their intercourse had been one continued series of opposition
their opinions clashed and indeed she had never perceived that he had cared for her opinions as belonging to her the individual
as far as they defied his rocklike power of character his passionstrength he seemed to throw them off from him with contempt until she felt the weariness of the exertion of making useless protests and now he had come in this strange wild passionate way to make known his love
for although at first it had struck her that his offer was forced and goaded out of him by sharp compassion for the exposure she had made of herselfwhich he like others might misunderstandyet even before he left the roomand certainly not five minutes after the clear conviction dawned upon her shined bright upon her that he did love her that he had loved her that he would love her
and she shrank and shuddered as under the fascination of some great power repugnant to her whole previous life
she crept away and hid from his idea
but it was of no use
to parody a line out of fairfaxs tasso      his strong idea wandered through her thought  she disliked him the more for having mastered her inner will
how dared he say that he would love her still even though she shook him off with contempt
she wished she had spoken morestronger
sharp decisive speeches came thronging into her mind now that it was too late to utter them
the deep impression made by the interview was like that of a horror in a dream that will not leave the room although we waken up and rub our eyes and force a stiff rigid smile upon our lips
it is therethere cowering and gibbering with fixed ghastly eyes in some corner of the chamber listening to hear whether we dare to breathe of its presence to any one
and we dare not poor cowards that we are
and so she shuddered away from the threat of his enduring love
what did he mean
had she not the power to daunt him
she would see
it was more daring than became a man to threaten her so
did he ground it upon the miserable yesterday
if need were she would do the same tomorrowby a crippled beggar willingly and gladlybut by him she would do it just as bravely in spite of his deductions and the cold slime of womans impertinence
she did it because it was right and simple and true to save where she could save even to try to save
fais ce que dois advienne que pourra  hitherto she had not stirred from where he had left her no outward circumstances had roused her out of the trance of thought in which she had been plunged by his last words and by the look of his deep intent passionate eyes as their flames had made her own fall before them
she went to the window and threw it open to dispel the oppression which hung around her
then she went and opened the door with a sort of impetuous wish to shake off the recollection of the past hour in the company of others or in active exertion
but all was profoundly hushed in the noonday stillness of a house where an invalid catches the unrefreshing sleep that is denied to the nighthours
margaret would not be alone
what should she do
go and see bessy higgins of course thought she as the recollection of the message sent the night before flashed into her mind
and away she went
when she got there she found bessy lying on the settle moved close to the fire though the day was sultry and oppressive
she was laid down quite flat as if resting languidly after some paroxysm of pain
margaret felt sure she ought to have the greater freedom of breathing which a more sitting posture would procure and without a word she raised her up and so arranged the pillows that bessy was more at ease though very languid
i thought i should na ha seen yo again said she at last looking wistfully in margarets face
im afraid youre much worse
but i could not have come yesterday my mother was so illfor many reasons said margaret colouring
yod mappen think i went beyond my place in sending mary for yo
but the wraglin and the loud voices had just torn me to pieces and i thought when father left oh
if i could just hear her voice reading me some words o peace and promise i could die away into the silence and rest o god just as a baby is hushed up to sleep by its mothers lullaby  shall i read you a chapter now  ay do
mappen i shant listen to th sense at first it will seem far awaybut when yo come to words i liketo th comforting textsitll seem close in my ear and going through me as it were  margaret began
bessy tossed to and fro
if by an effort she attended for one moment it seemed as though she were convulsed into double restlessness the next
at last she burst out dont go on reading
its no use
im blaspheming all the time in my mind wi thinking angrily on what canna be helpedyod hear of th riot mappen yesterday at marlborough mills
thorntons factory yo know  your father was not there was he said margaret colouring deeply
not he
hed ya given his right hand if it had never come to pass
its that thats fretting me
hes fairly knocked down in his mind by it
its no use telling him fools will always break out o bounds
yo never saw a man so downhearted as he is  but why asked margaret
i dont understand  why yo see hes a committeeman on this special strike
th union appointed him because though i say it as shouldnt say it hes reckoned a deep chap and true to th backbone
and he and tother committeemen laid their plans
they were to houd together through thick and thin what the major part thought tothers were to think whether they would or no
and above all there was to be no going again the law of the land
folk would go with them if they saw them striving and starving wi dumb patience but if there was once any noise o fighting and strugglingeven wi knobsticksall was up as they know by th experience of many and many a time before
they would try and get speech o th knobsticks and coax em and reason wi em and mappen warn em off but whatever came the committee charged all members o th union to lie down and die if need were without striking a blow and then they reckoned they were sure o carrying th public with them
and besides all that committee knew they were right in their demand and they didnt want to have right all mixed up wi wrong till folk cant separate it no more nor i can the physicpowder from th jelly yo gave me to mix it in jelly is much the biggest but powder tastes it all through
well ive told yo at length about thisn but i am tired out
yo just think for yorsel what it mun be for father to have a his work undone and by such a fool as boucher who must needs go right again the orders of committee and ruin th strike just as bad as if he meant to be a judas
eh
but father givd it him last night
he went so far as to say hed go and tell police where they might find th ringleader o th riot hed give him up to th millowners to do what they would wi him
hed show the world that th real leaders o the strike were not such as boucher but steady thoughtful men good hands and good citizens who were friendly to law and judgment and would uphold order who only wanted their right wage and wouldnt work even though they starved till they got em but who would neer injure property or life
for dropping her voice they do say that boucher threw a stone at thorntons sister that welly killed her  thats not true said margaret
it was not boucher that threw the stoneshe went first red then white
yod be there then were yo asked bessie languidly for indeed she had spoken with many pauses as if speech was unusually difficult to her
yes
never mind
go on
only it was not boucher that threw the stone
but what did he answer to your father  he did na speak words
he were all in such a tremble wi spent passion i could na bear to look at him
i heard his breath coming quick and at one time i thought he were sobbing
but when father said hed give him up to police he gave a great cry and struck father on th face wi his closed fist and he off like lightning
father were stunned wi the blow at first for all boucher were weak wi passion and wi clemming
he sat down a bit and put his hand afore his eyes and then made for th door
i dunno where i got strength but i threw mysel oh th settle and clung to him
father father said i
thoull never go peach on that poor clemmed man
ill never leave go on thee till thou sayst thou wunnot dunnot be a fool says he words come readier than deeds to most men
i never thought o telling th police on him though by g he deserves it and i should na ha minded if some one else had done the dirty work and got him clapped up
but now he has strucken me i could do it less nor ever for it would be getting other men to take up my quarrel
but if ever he gets well oer this clemming and is in good condition he and ill have an up and down fight purring an a and ill see what i can do for him and so father shook me offfor indeed i was low and faint enough and his face was all clay white where it werent bloody and turned me sick to look at
and i know not if i slept or waked or were in a dead swoon till mary come in and i telled her to fetch yo to me
and now dunnot talk to me but just read out th chapter
im easier in my mind for having spit it out but i want some thoughts of the world thats far away to take the weary taste of it out of my mouth
read me not a sermon chapter but a story chapter theyve pictures in them which i see when my eyes are shut
read about the new heavens and the new earth and mappen ill forget this  margaret read in her soft low voice
though bessys eyes were shut she was listening for some time for the moisture of tears gathered heavy on her eyelashes
at last she slept with many starts and muttered pleadings
margaret covered her up and left her for she had an uneasy consciousness that she might be wanted at home and yet until now it seemed cruel to leave the dying girl
mrs hale was in the drawingroom on her daughters return
it was one of her better days and she was full of praises of the waterbed
it had been more like the beds at sir john beresfords than anything she had slept on since
she did not know how it was but people seemed to have lost the art of making the same kind of beds as they used to do in her youth
one would think it was easy enough there was the same kind of feathers to be had and yet somehow till this last night she did not know when she had had a good sound resting sleep
mr hale suggested that something of the merits of the featherbeds of former days might be attributed to the activity of youth which gave a relish to rest but this idea was not kindly received by his wife
no indeed mr hale it was those beds at sir johns
now margaret youre young enough and go about in the day are the beds comfortable
i appeal to you
do they give you a feeling of perfect repose when you lie down upon them or rather dont you toss about and try in vain to find an easy position and wake in the morning as tired as when you went to bed  margaret laughed
to tell the truth mamma ive never thought about my bed at all what kind it is
im so sleepy at night that if i only lie down anywhere i nap off directly
so i dont think im a competent witness
but then you know i never had the opportunity of trying sir john beresfords beds
i never was at oxenham  were you not
oh no
to be sure
it was poor darling fred i took with me i remember
i only went to oxenham once after i was marriedto your aunt shaws wedding and poor little fred was the baby then
and i know dixon did not like changing from ladys maid to nurse and i was afraid that if i took her near her old home and amongst her own people she might want to leave me
but poor baby was taken ill at oxenham with his teething and what with my being a great deal with anna just before her marriage and not being very strong myself dixon had more of the charge of him than she ever had before and it made her so fond of him and she was so proud when he would turn away from every one and cling to her that i dont believe she ever thought of leaving me again though it was very different from what shed been accustomed to
poor fred
everybody loved him
he was born with the gift of winning hearts
it makes me think very badly of captain reid when i know that he disliked my own dear boy
i think it a certain proof he had a bad heart
ah
your poor father margaret
he has left the room
he cant bear to hear fred spoken of  i love to hear about him mamma
tell me all you like you never can tell me too much
tell me what he was like as a baby  why margaret you must not be hurt but he was much prettier than you were
i remember when i first saw you in dixons arms i said dear what an ugly little thing and she said its not every child thats like master fred bless him dear
how well i remember it
then i could have had fred in my arms every minute of the day and his cot was close by my bed and now nowmargareti dont know where my boy is and sometimes i think i shall never see him again  margaret sat down by her mothers sofa on a little stool and softly took hold of her hand caressing it and kissing it as if to comfort
mrs hale cried without restraint
at last she sat straight stiff up on the sofa and turning round to her daughter she said with tearful almost solemn earnestness margaret if i can get betterif god lets me have a chance of recovery it must be through seeing my son frederick once more
it will waken up all the poor springs of health left in me  she paused and seemed to try and gather strength for something more yet to be said
her voice was choked as she went onwas quavering as with the contemplation of some strange yet closelypresent idea
and margaret if i am to dieif i am one of those appointed to die before many weeks are overi must see my child first
i cannot think how it must be managed but i charge you margaret as you yourself hope for comfort in your last illness bring him to me that i may bless him
only for five minutes margaret
there could be no danger in five minutes
oh margaret let me see him before i die  margaret did not think of anything that might be utterly unreasonable in this speech we do not look for reason or logic in the passionate entreaties of those who are sick unto death we are stung with the recollection of a thousand slighted opportunities of fulfilling the wishes of those who will soon pass away from among us and do they ask us for the future happiness of our lives we lay it at their feet and will it away from us
but this wish of mrs hales was so natural so just so right to both parties that margaret felt as if on fredericks account as well as on her mothers she ought to overlook all intermediate chances of danger and pledge herself to do everything in her power for its realization
the large pleading dilated eyes were fixed upon her wistfully steady in their gaze though the poor white lips quivered like those of a child
margaret gently rose up and stood opposite to her frail mother so that she might gather the secure fulfilment of her wish from the calm steadiness of her daughters face
mamma i will write tonight and tell frederick what you say
i am as sure that he will come directly to us as i am sure of my life
be easy mamma you shall see him as far as anything earthly can be promised  you will write tonight
oh margaret
the post goes out at fiveyou will write by it wont you
i have so few hours lefti feel dear as if i should not recover though sometimes your father overpersuades me into hoping you will write directly wont you
dont lose a single post for just by that very post i may miss him  but mamma papa is out  papa is out
and what then
do you mean that he would deny me this last wish margaret
why i should not be ill be dyingif he had not taken me away from helstone to this unhealthy smoky sunless place  oh mamma said margaret
yes it is so indeed
he knows it himself he has said so many a time
he would do anything for me you dont mean he would refuse me this last wishprayer if you will
and indeed margaret the longing to see frederick stands between me and god
i cannot pray till i have this one thing indeed i cannot
dont lose time dear dear margaret
write by this very next post
then he may be herehere in twentytwo days
for he is sure to come
no cords or chains can keep him
in twentytwo days i shall see my boy she fell back and for a short time she took no notice of the fact that margaret sat motionless her hand shading her eyes
you are not writing said her mother at last
bring me some pens and paper i will try and write myself she sat up trembling all over with feverish eagerness
margaret took her hand down and looked at her mother sadly
only wait till papa comes in
let us ask him how best to do it  you promised margaret not a quarter of an hour agoyou said he should come  and so he shall mamma dont cry my own dear mother
ill write here nowyou shall see me writeand it shall go by this very post and if papa thinks fit he can write again when he comes init is only a days delay
oh mamma dont cry so pitifully it cuts me to the heart  mrs hale could not stop her tears they came hysterically and in truth she made no effort to control them but rather called up all the pictures of the happy past and the probable futurepainting the scene when she should lie a corpse with the son she had longed to see in life weeping over her and she unconscious of his presencetill she was melted by selfpity into a state of sobbing and exhaustion that made margarets heart ache
but at last she was calm and greedily watched her daughter as she began her letter wrote it with swift urgent entreaty sealed it up hurriedly for fear her mother should ask to see it and then to make security most sure at mrs hales own bidding took it herself to the postoffice
she was coming home when her father overtook her
and where have you been my pretty maid asked he
to the postofficewith a letter a letter to frederick
oh papa perhaps i have done wrong but mamma was seized with such a passionate yearning to see himshe said it would make her well againand then she said that she must see him before she diedi cannot tell you how urgent she was
did i do wrong  mr hale did not reply at first
then he said  you should have waited till i came in margaret  i tried to persuade her and then she was silent
i dont know said mr hale after a pause
she ought to see him if she wishes it so much for i believe it would do her much more good than all the doctors medicineand perhaps set her up altogether but the danger to him im afraid is very great  all these years since the mutiny papa  yes it is necessary of course for government to take very stringent measures for the repression of offences against authority more particularly in the navy where a commanding officer needs to be surrounded in his mens eyes with a vivid consciousness of all the power there is at home to back him and take up his cause and avenge any injuries offered to him if need be
ah
its no matter to them how far their authorities have tyrannisedgalled hasty tempers to madnessor if that can be any excuse afterwards it is never allowed for in the first instance they spare no expense they send out shipsthey scour the seas to lay hold of the offendersthe lapse of years does not wash out the memory of the offenceit is a fresh and vivid crime on the admiralty books till it is blotted out by blood  oh papa what have i done
and yet it seemed so right at the time
im sure frederick himself would run the risk  so he would so he should
nay margaret im glad it is done though i durst not have done it myself
im thankful it is as it is i should have hesitated till perhaps it might have been too late to do any good
dear margaret you have done what is right about it and the end is beyond our control  it was all very well but her fathers account of the relentless manner in which mutinies were punished made margaret shiver and creep
if she had decoyed her brother home to blot out the memory of his error by his blood
she saw her fathers anxiety lap deeper than the source of his latter cheering words
she took his arm and walked home pensively and wearily by his side
i have found that holy place of rest     still changeless               mrs hemans
when mr thornton had left the house that morning he was almost blinded by his baffled passion
he was as dizzy as if margaret instead of looking and speaking and moving like a tender graceful woman had been a sturdy fishwife and given him a sound blow with her fists
he had positive bodily paina violent headache and a throbbing intermittent pulse
he could not bear the noise the garish light the continued rumble and movement of the street
he called himself a fool for suffering so and yet he could not at the moment recollect the cause of his suffering and whether it was adequate to the consequences it had produced
it would have been a relief to him if he could have sat down and cried on a doorstep by a little child who was raging and storming through his passionate tears at some injury he had received
he said to himself that he hated margaret but a wild sharp sensation of love cleft his dull thunderous feeling like lightning even as he shaped the words expressive of hatred
his greatest comfort was in hugging his torment and in feeling as he had indeed said to her that though she might despise him contemn him treat him with her proud sovereign indifference he did not change one whit
she could not make him change
he loved her and would love her and defy her and this miserable bodily pain
he stood still for a moment to make this resolution firm and clear
there was an omnibus passinggoing into the country the conductor thought he was wishing for a place and stopped near the pavement
it was too much trouble to apologise and explain so he mounted upon it and was borne awaypast long rows of housesthen past detached villas with trim gardens till they came to real country hedgerows and byandby to a small country town
then everybody got down and so did mr thornton and because they walked away he did so too
he went into the fields walking briskly because the sharp motion relieved his mind
he could remember all about it now the pitiful figure he must have cut the absurd way in which he had gone and done the very thing he had so often agreed with himself in thinking would be the most foolish thing in the world and had met with exactly the consequences which in these wise moods he had always foretold were certain to follow if he ever did make such a fool of himself
was he bewitched by those beautiful eyes that soft halfopen sighing mouth which lay so close upon his shoulder only yesterday
he could not even shake off the recollection that she had been there that her arms had been round him onceif never again
he only caught glimpses of her he did not understand her altogether
at one time she was so brave and at another so timid now so tender and then so haughty and regal proud
and then he thought over every time he had ever seen her once again by way of finally forgetting her
he saw her in every dress in every mood and did not know which became her best
even this morning how magnificent she had lookedher eyes flashing out upon him at the idea that because she had shared his danger yesterday she had cared for him the least
if mr thornton was a fool in the morning as he assured himself at least twenty times he was he did not grow much wiser in the afternoon
all that he gained for his sixpenny omnibus ride was a more vivid conviction that there never was never could be any one like margaret that she did not love him and never would but that sheno
nor the whole worldshould never hinder him from loving her
and so he returned to the little marketplace and remounted the omnibus to return to milton
it was late in the afternoon when he was set down near his warehouse
the accustomed places brought back the accustomed habits and trains of thought
he knew how much he had to domore than his usual work owing to the commotion of the day before
he had to see his brother magistrates he had to complete the arrangements only half made in the morning for the comfort and safety of his newly imported irish hands he had to secure them from all chance of communication with the discontented workpeople of milton
last of all he had to go home and encounter his mother
mrs thornton had sat in the diningroom all day every moment expecting the news of her sons acceptance by miss hale
she had braced herself up many and many a time at some sudden noise in the house had caught up the halfdropped work and begun to ply her needle diligently though through dimmed spectacles and with an unsteady hand
and many times had the door opened and some indifferent person entered on some insignificant errand
then her rigid face unstiffened from its gray frostbound expression and the features dropped into the relaxed look of despondency so unusual to their sternness
she wrenched herself away from the contemplation of all the dreary changes that would be brought about to herself by her sons marriage she forced her thoughts into the accustomed household grooves
the newlymarried coupletobe would need fresh household stocks of linen and mrs thornton had clothesbasket upon clothesbasket full of tablecloths and napkins brought in and began to reckon up the store
there was some confusion between what was hers and consequently marked g h t for george and hannah thornton and what was her sonsbought with his money marked with his initials
some of those marked g h t were dutch damask of the old kind exquisitely fine none were like them now
mrs thornton stood looking at them longthey had been her pride when she was first married
then she knit her brows and pinched and compressed her lips tight and carefully unpicked the gh
she went so far as to search for the turkeyred markingthread to put in the new initials but it was all usedand she had no heart to send for any more just yet
so she looked fixedly at vacancy a series of visions passing before her in all of which her son was the principal the sole objecther son her pride her property
still he did not come
doubtless he was with miss hale
the new love was displacing her already from her place as first in his heart
a terrible paina pang of vain jealousyshot through her she hardly knew whether it was more physical or mental but it forced her to sit down
in a moment she was up again as straight as evera grim smile upon her face for the first time that day ready for the door opening and the rejoicing triumphant one who should never know the sore regret his mother felt at his marriage
in all this there was little thought enough of the future daughterinlaw as an individual
she was to be johns wife
to take mrs thorntons place as mistress of the house was only one of the rich consequences which decked out the supreme glory all household plenty and comfort all purple and fine linen honour love obedience troops of friends would all come as naturally as jewels on a kings robe and be as little thought of for their separate value
to be chosen by john would separate a kitchenwench from the rest of the world
and miss hale was not so bad
if she had been a milton lass mrs thornton would have positively liked her
she was pungent and had taste and spirit and flavour in her
true she was sadly prejudiced and very ignorant but that was to be expected from her southern breeding
a strange sort of mortified comparison of fanny with her went on in mrs thorntons mind and for once she spoke harshly to her daughter abused her roundly and then by way of penance she took up henrys commentaries and tried to fix her attention on it instead of pursuing the employment she took pride in and continuing her inspection of the tablelinen
his step at last
she heard him even while she thought she was finishing a sentence while her eye did pass over it and her memory could mechanically have repeated it word for word she heard him come in at the halldoor
her quickened sense could interpret every sound of motion now he was at the hatstandnow at the very roomdoor
why did he pause
let her know the worst
yet her head was down over the book she did not look up
he came close to the table and stood still there waiting till she should have finished the paragraph which apparently absorbed her
by an effort she looked up
well john  he knew what that little speech meant
but he had steeled himself
he longed to reply with a jest the bitterness of his heart could have uttered one but his mother deserved better of him
he came round behind her so that she could not see his looks and bending back her gray stony face he kissed it murmuring  no one loves meno one cares for me but you mother  he turned away and stood leaning his head against the mantelpiece tears forcing themselves into his manly eyes
she stood upshe tottered
for the first time in her life the strong woman tottered
she put her hands on his shoulders she was a tall woman
she looked into his face she made him look at her
mothers love is given by god john
it holds fast for ever and ever
a girls love is like a puff of smokeit changes with every wind
and she would not have you my own lad would not she she set her teeth she showed them like a dog for the whole length of her mouth
he shook his head
i am not fit for her mother i knew i was not  she ground out words between her closed teeth
he could not hear what she said but the look in her eyes interpreted it to be a curseif not as coarsely worded as fell in intent as ever was uttered
and yet her heart leapt up light to know he was her own again
mother said he hurriedly i cannot hear a word against her
spare mespare me
i am very weak in my sore hearti love her yet i love her more than ever  and i hate her said mrs thornton in a low fierce voice
i tried not to hate her when she stood between you and me becausei said to myselfshe will make him happy and i would give my hearts blood to do that
but now i hate her for your miserys sake
yes john its no use hiding up your aching heart from me
i am the mother that bore you and your sorrow is my agony and if you dont hate her i do  then mother you make me love her more
she is unjustly treated by you and i must make the balance even
but why do we talk of love or hatred
she does not care for me and that is enough too much
let us never name the subject again
it is the only thing you can do for me in the matter
let us never name her  with all my heart
i only wish that she and all belonging to her were swept back to the place they came from  he stood still gazing into the fire for a minute or two longer
her dry dim eyes filled with unwonted tears as she looked at him but she seemed just as grim and quiet as usual when he next spoke
warrants are out against three men for conspiracy mother
the riot yesterday helped to knock up the strike  and margarets name was no more mentioned between mrs thornton and her son
they fell back into their usual mode of talkabout facts not opinions far less feelings
their voices and tones were calm and cold a stranger might have gone away and thought that he had never seen such frigid indifference of demeanour between such near relations
fruitpiece
for never any thing can be amiss      when simpleness and duty tender it                 midsummer nights dream
mr thornton went straight and clear into all the interests of the following day
there was a slight demand for finished goods and as it affected his branch of the trade he took advantage of it and drove hard bargains
he was sharp to the hour at the meeting of his brother magistratesgiving them the best assistance of his strong sense and his power of seeing consequences at a glance and so coming to a rapid decision
older men men of long standing in the town men of far greater wealthrealised and turned into land while his was all floating capital engaged in his tradelooked to him for prompt ready wisdom
he was the one deputed to see and arrange with the policeto lead in all the requisite steps
and he cared for their unconscious deference no more than for the soft west wind that scarcely made the smoke from the great tall chimneys swerve in its straight upward course
he was not aware of the silent respect paid to him
if it had been otherwise he would have felt it as an obstacle in his progress to the object he had in view
as it was he looked to the speedy accomplishment of that alone
it was his mothers greedy ears that sucked in from the womenkind of these magistrates and wealthy men how highly mr
this or mr that thought of mr thornton that if he had not been there things would have gone on very differentlyvery badly indeed
he swept off his business right and left that day
it seemed as though his deep mortification of yesterday and the stunned purposeless course of the hours afterwards had cleared away all the mists from his intellect
he felt his power and revelled in it
he could almost defy his heart
if he had known it he could have sang the song of the miller who lived by the river dee      i care for nobody     nobody cares for me  the evidence against boucher and other ringleaders of the riot was taken before him that against the three others for conspiracy failed
but he sternly charged the police to be on the watch for the swift right arm of the law should be in readiness to strike as soon as they could prove a fault
and then he left the hot reeking room in the borough court and went out into the fresher but still sultry street
it seemed as though he gave way all at once he was so languid that he could not control his thoughts they would wander to her they would bring back the scenenot of his repulse and rejection the day before but the looks the actions of the day before that
he went along the crowded streets mechanically winding in and out among the people but never seeing themalmost sick with longing for that one halfhourthat one brief space of time when she clung to him and her heart beat against histo come once again
why mr thornton
youre cutting me very coolly i must say
and how is mrs thornton
brave weather this
we doctors dont like it i can tell you  i beg your pardon dr donaldson
i really didnt see you
my mothers quite well thank you
it is a fine day and good for the harvest i hope
if the wheat is well got in we shall have a brisk trade next year whatever you doctors have  ay ay
each man for himself
your bad weather and your bad times are my good ones
when trade is bad theres more undermining of health and preparation for death going on among you milton men than youre aware of  not with me doctor
im made of iron
the news of the very worst bad debt i ever had never made my pulse vary
this strike which affects me more than any one else in miltonmore than hampernever comes near my appetite
you must go elsewhere for a patient doctor  by the way youve recommended me a good patient poor lady
not to go on talking in this heartless way i seriously believe that mrs halethat lady in crampton you knowhasnt many weeks to live
i never had any hope of cure as i think i told you but ive been seeing her today and i think very badly of her  mr thornton was silent
the vaunted steadiness of pulse failed him for an instant
can i do anything doctor he asked in an altered voice
you knowyou would see that money is not very plentiful are there any comforts or dainties she ought to have  no replied the doctor shaking his head
she craves for fruitshe has a constant fever on her but jargonelle pears will do as well as anything and there are quantities of them in the market  you will tell me if there is anything i can do im sure replied mr thornton
i rely upon you  oh
never fear
ill not spare your pursei know its deep enough
i wish youd give me a carteblanche for all my patients and all their wants  but mr thornton had no general benevolenceno universal philanthropy few even would have given him credit for strong affections
but he went straight to the first fruitshop in milton and chose out the bunch of purple grapes with the most delicate bloom upon themthe richestcoloured peachesthe freshest vineleaves
they were packed into a basket and the shopman awaited the answer to his inquiry where shall we send them to sir  there was no reply
to marlborough mills i suppose sir  no mr thornton said
give the basket to meill take it  it took up both his hands to carry it and he had to pass through the busiest part of the town for feminine shopping
many a young lady of his acquaintance turned to look after him and thought it strange to see him occupied just like a porter or an errandboy
he was thinking i will not be daunted from doing as i choose by the thought of her
i like to take this fruit to the poor mother and it is simply right that i should
she shall never scorn me out of doing what i please
a pretty joke indeed if for fear of a haughty girl i failed in doing a kindness to a man i liked
i do it for mr hale i do it in defiance of her  he went at an unusual pace and was soon at crampton
he went upstairs two steps at a time and entered the drawingroom before dixon could announce himhis face flushed his eyes shining with kindly earnestness
mrs hale lay on the sofa heated with fever
mr hale was reading aloud
margaret was working on a low stool by her mothers side
her heart fluttered if his did not at this interview
but he took no notice of herhardly of mr hale himself he went up straight with his basket to mrs hale and said in that subdued and gentle tone which is so touching when used by a robust man in full health speaking to a feeble invalid  i met dr donaldson maam and as he said fruit would be good for you i have taken the libertythe great libertyof bringing you some that seemed to me fine mrs hale was excessively pleased quite in a tremble of eagerness
mr hale with fewer words expressed a deeper gratitude
fetch a plate margareta basketanything margaret stood up by the table half afraid of moving or making any noise to arouse mr thornton into a consciousness of her being in the room
she thought it would be awkward for both to be brought into conscious collision and fancied that from her being on a low seat at first and now standing behind her father he had overlooked her in his haste
as if he did not feel the consciousness of her presence all over though his eyes had never rested on her
i must go said he i cannot stay
if you will forgive this libertymy rough waystoo abrupt i fearbut i will be more gentle next time
you will allow me the pleasure of bringing you some fruit again if i should see any that is tempting
good afternoon mr hale
goodbye maam  he was gone
not one word not one look to margaret
she believed that he had not seen her
she went for a plate in silence and lifted the fruit out tenderly with the points of her delicate taper fingers
it was good of him to bring it and after yesterday too
oh
it is so delicious said mrs hale in a feeble voice
how kind of him to think of me
margaret love only taste these grapes
was it not good of him  yes said margaret quietly
margaret said mrs hale rather querulously you wont like anything mr thornton does
i never saw anybody so prejudiced  mr hale had been peeling a peach for his wife and cutting off a small piece for himself he said  if i had any prejudices the gift of such delicious fruit as this would melt them away
i have not tasted such fruitno
not even in hampshiresince i was a boy and to boys i fancy all fruit is good
i remember eating sloes and crabs with a relish
do you remember the mattedup currant bushes margaret at the corner of the westwall at the garden at home  did she not
did she not remember every weatherstain on the old stone wall the gray and yellow lichens that marked it like a map the little cranesbill that grew in the crevices
she had been shaken by the events of the last two days her whole life just now was a strain upon her fortitude and somehow these careless words of her fathers touching on the remembrance of the sunny times of old made her start up and dropping her sewing on the ground she went hastily out of the room into her own little chamber
she had hardly given way to the first choking sob when she became aware of dixon standing at her drawers and evidently searching for something
bless me miss
how you startled me
missus is not worse is she
is anything the matter  no nothing
only im silly dixon and want a glass of water
what are you looking for
i keep my muslins in that drawer  dixon did not speak but went on rummaging
the scent of lavender came out and perfumed the room
at last dixon found what she wanted what it was margaret could not see
dixon faced round and spoke to her  now i dont like telling what i wanted because youve fretting enough to go through and i know youll fret about this
i meant to have kept it from you till night may be or such times as that  what is the matter
pray tell me dixon at once  that young woman you go to seehiggins i mean  well  well
she died this morning and her sister is herecome to beg a strange thing
it seems the young woman who died had a fancy for being buried in something of yours and so the sisters come to ask for itand i was looking for a nightcap that wasnt too good to give away  oh
let me find one said margaret in the midst of her tears
poor bessy
i never thought i should not see her again  why thats another thing
this girl downstairs wanted me to ask you if you would like to see her  but shes dead said margaret turning a little pale
i never saw a dead person
no
i would rather not  i should never have asked you if you hadnt come in
i told her you wouldnt  i will go down and speak to her said margaret afraid lest dixons harshness of manner might wound the poor girl
so taking the cap in her hand she went to the kitchen
marys face was all swollen with crying and she burst out afresh when she saw margaret
oh maam she loved yo she loved yo she did indeed and for a long time margaret could not get her to say anything more than this
at last her sympathy and dixons scolding forced out a few facts
nicholas higgins had gone out in the morning leaving bessy as well as on the day before
but in an hour she was taken worse some neighbour ran to the room where mary was working they did not know where to find her father mary had only come in a few minutes before she died
it were a day or two ago she axed to be buried in somewhat o yourn
she were never tired o talking o yo
she used to say yo were the prettiest thing she ever clapped eyes on
she loved yo dearly
her last words were give her my affectionate respects and keep father fro drink yoll come and see her maam
she would ha thought it a great compliment i know  margaret shrank a little from answering
yes perhaps i may
yes i will
ill come before tea
but wheres your father mary  mary shook her head and stood up to be going
miss hale said dixon in a low voice wheres the use o your going to see the poor thing laid out
id never say a word against it if it could do the girl any good and i wouldnt mind a bit going myself if that would satisfy her
theyve just a notion these common folks of its being a respect to the departed
here said she turning sharply round ill come and see your sister
miss hale is busy and she cant come or else she would  the girl looked wistfully at margaret
dixons coming might be a compliment but it was not the same thing to the poor sister who had had her little pangs of jealousy during bessys lifetime at the intimacy between her and the young lady
no dixon said margaret with decision
i will go
mary you shall see me this afternoon and for fear of her own cowardice she went away in order to take from herself any chance of changing her determination
comfort in sorrow
through cross to crownand though thy spirits life       trials untold assail with giant strength     good cheer
good cheer
soon ends the bitter strife       and thou shalt reign in peace with christ at length               kosegarten
ay sooth we feel too strong in weal to need thee on that road     but woe being come the soul is dumb that crieth not on god               mrs browning
that afternoon she walked swiftly to the higginss house
mary was looking out for her with a halfdistrustful face
margaret smiled into her eyes to reassure her
they passed quickly through the houseplace upstairs and into the quiet presence of the dead
then margaret was glad that she had come
the face so often weary with pain so restless with troublous thoughts had now the faint soft smile of eternal rest upon it
the slow tears gathered into margarets eyes but a deep calm entered into her soul
and that was death
it looked more peaceful than life
all beautiful scriptures came into her mind
they rest from their labours the weary are at rest he giveth his beloved sleep  slowly slowly margaret turned away from the bed
mary was humbly sobbing in the background
they went downstairs without a word
resting his hand upon the housetable nicholas higgins stood in the midst of the floor his great eyes startled open by the news he had heard as he came along the court from many busy tongues
his eyes were dry and fierce studying the reality of her death bringing himself to understand that her place should know her no more
for she had been sickly dying so long that he had persuaded himself she would not die that she would pull through  margaret felt as if she had no business to be there familiarly acquainting herself with the surroundings of death which he the father had only just learnt
there had been a pause of an instant on the steep crooked stair when she first saw him but now she tried to steal past his abstracted gaze and to leave him in the solemn circle of his household misery
mary sat down on the first chair she came to and throwing her apron over her head began to cry
the noise appeared to rouse him
he took sudden hold of margarets arm and held her till he could gather words to speak
his throat seemed dry they came up thick and choked and hoarse  were yo with her
did yo see her die  no replied margaret standing still with the utmost patience now she found herself perceived
it was some time before he spoke again but he kept his hold on her arm
all men must die said he at last with a strange sort of gravity which first suggested to margaret the idea that he had been drinkingnot enough to intoxicate himself but enough to make his thoughts bewildered
but she were younger than me still he pondered over the event not looking at margaret though he grasped her tight
suddenly he looked up at her with a wild searching inquiry in his glance
yore sure and certain shes deadnot in a dwam a faint
shes been so before often  she is dead replied margaret
she felt no fear in speaking to him though he hurt her arm with his gripe and wild gleams came across the stupidity of his eyes
she is dead she said
he looked at her still with that searching look which seemed to fade out of his eyes as he gazed
then he suddenly let go his hold of margaret and throwing his body half across the table he shook it and every piece of furniture in the room with his violent sobs
mary came trembling towards him
get thee goneget thee gone he cried striking wildly and blindly at her
what do i care for thee margaret took her hand and held it softly in hers
he tore his hair he beat his head against the hard wood then he lay exhausted and stupid
still his daughter and margaret did not move
mary trembled from head to foot
at lastit might have been a quarter of an hour it might have been an hourhe lifted himself up
his eyes were swollen and bloodshot and he seemed to have forgotten that any one was by he scowled at the watchers when he saw them
he shook himself heavily gave them one more sullen look spoke never a word but made for the door
oh father father said mary throwing herself upon his armnot tonight
any night but tonight
oh help me
hes going out to drink again
father ill not leave yo
yo may strike but ill not leave yo
she told me last of all to keep yo fro drink  but margaret stood in the doorway silent yet commanding
he looked up at her defyingly
its my own house
stand out o the way wench or ill make yo he had shaken off mary with violence he looked ready to strike margaret
but she never moved a featurenever took her deep serious eyes off him
he stared back on her with gloomy fierceness
if she had stirred hand or foot he would have thrust her aside with even more violence than he had used to his own daughter whose face was bleeding from her fall against a chair
what are yo looking at me in that way for asked he at last daunted and awed by her severe calm
if yo think for to keep me from going what gait i choose because she loved yoand in my own house too where i never asked yo to come yore mistaen
its very hard upon a man that he cant go to the only comfort left  margaret felt that he acknowledged her power
what could she do next
he had seated himself on a chair close to the door halfconquered halfresenting intending to go out as soon as she left her position but unwilling to use the violence he had threatened not five minutes before
margaret laid her hand on his arm
come with me she said
come and see her  the voice in which she spoke was very low and solemn but there was no fear or doubt expressed in it either of him or of his compliance
he sullenly rose up
he stood uncertain with dogged irresolution upon his face
she waited him there quietly and patiently waited for his time to move
he had a strange pleasure in making her wait but at last he moved towards the stairs
she and he stood by the corpse
her last words to mary were keep my father fro drink  it canna hurt her now muttered he
nought can hurt her now then raising his voice to a wailing cry he went on we may quarrel and fall outwe may make peace and be friendswe may clem to skin and boneand nought o all our griefs will ever touch her more
hoos had her portion on em
what wi hard work first and sickness at last hoo led the life of a dog
and to die without knowing one good piece o rejoicing in all her days
nay wench whatever hoo said hoo can know nought about it now and i mun ha a sup o drink just to steady me again sorrow  no said margaret softening with his softened manner
you shall not
if her life has been what you say at any rate she did not fear death as some do
oh you should have heard her speak of the life to comethe life hidden with god that she is now gone to  he shook his head glancing sideways up at margaret as he did so
his pale haggard face struck her painfully
you are sorely tried
where have you been all daynot at work  not at work sure enough said he with a short grim laugh
not at what you call work
i were at the committee till i were sickened out wi trying to make fools hear reason
i were fetched to bouchers wife afore seven this morning
shes bedfast but she were raving and raging to know where her dunnerheaded brute of a chap was as if id to keep himas if he were fit to be ruled by me
the dd fool who has put his foot in all our plans
and ive walked my feet sore wi going about for to see men who wouldnt be seen now the law is raised against us
and i were sorehearted too which is worse than sorefooted and if i did see a friend who ossed to treat me i never knew hoo lay adying here
bess lass thoud believe me thou wouldstwouldstnt thou turning to the poor dumb form with wild appeal
i am sure said margaret i am sure you did not know it was quite sudden
but now you see it would be different you do know you do see her lying there you hear what she said with her last breath
you will not go  no answer
in fact where was he to look for comfort
come home with me said she at last with a bold venture half trembling at her own proposal as she made it
at least you shall have some comfortable food which im sure you need  yor fathers a parson asked he with a sudden turn in his ideas
he was said margaret shortly
ill go and take a dish o tea with him since yove asked me
ive many a thing i often wished to say to a parson and im not particular as to whether hes preaching now or not  margaret was perplexed his drinking tea with her father who would be totally unprepared for his visitorher mother so illseemed utterly out of the question and yet if she drew back now it would be worse than eversure to drive him to the ginshop
she thought that if she could only get him to their own house it was so great a step gained that she would trust to the chapter of accidents for the next
goodbye oud wench
weve parted company at last we have
but thoust been a blessin to thy father ever sin thou wert born
bless thy white lips lasstheyve a smile on em now
and im glad to see it once again though im lone and forlorn for evermore  he stooped down and fondly kissed his daughter covered up her face and turned to follow margaret
she had hastily gone down stairs to tell mary of the arrangement to say it was the only place she could think of to keep him from the ginpalace to urge mary to come too for her heart smote her at the idea of leaving the poor affectionate girl alone
but mary had friends amongst the neighbours she said who would come in and sit a bit with her it was all right but father  he was there by them or she would have spoken more
he had shaken off his emotion as if he was ashamed of having ever given way to it and had even oerleaped himself so much that he assumed a sort of bitter mirth like the crackling of thorns under a pot
im going to take my tea wi her father i am  but he slouched his cap low down over his brow as he went out into the street and looked neither to the right nor to the left while he tramped along by margarets side he feared being upset by the words still more the looks of sympathising neighbours
so he and margaret walked in silence
as he got near the street in which he knew she lived he looked down at his clothes his hands his shoes
i should mappen ha cleaned mysel first  it certainly would have been desirable but margaret assured him he should be allowed to go into the yard and have soap and towel provided she would not let him slip out of her hands just then
while he followed the houseservant along the passage and through the kitchen stepping cautiously on every dark mark in the pattern of the oilcloth in order to conceal his dirty footprints margaret ran upstairs
she met dixon on the landing
how is mammawhere is papa  missus was tired and gone into her own room
she had wanted to go to bed but dixon had persuaded her to lie down on the sofa and have her tea brought to her there it would be better than getting restless by being too long in bed
so far so good
but where was mr hale
in the drawingroom
margaret went in half breathless with the hurried story she had to tell
of course she told it incompletely and her father was rather taken aback by the idea of the drunken weaver awaiting him in his quiet study with whom he was expected to drink tea and on whose behalf margaret was anxiously pleading
the meek kindhearted mr hale would have readily tried to console him in his grief but unluckily the point margaret dwelt upon most forcibly was the fact of his having been drinking and her having brought him home with her as a last expedient to keep him from the ginshop
one little event had come out of another so naturally that margaret was hardly conscious of what she had done till she saw the slight look of repugnance on her fathers face
oh papa
he really is a man you will not dislikeif you wont be shocked to begin with  but margaret to bring a drunken man homeand your mother so ill  margarets countenance fell
i am sorry papa
he is very quiethe is not tipsy at all
he was only rather strange at first but that might be the shock of poor bessys death margarets eyes filled with tears
mr hale took hold of her sweet pleading face in both his hands and kissed her forehead
it is all right dear
ill go and make him as comfortable as i can and do you attend to your mother
only if you can come in and make a third in the study i shall be glad  oh yesthank you but as mr hale was leaving the room she ran after him
papayou must not wonder at what he says hes an i mean he does not believe much in what we do  oh dear
a drunken infidel weaver said mr hale to himself in dismay
but to margaret he only said if your mother goes to sleep be sure you come directly  margaret went into her mothers room
mrs hale lifted herself up from a doze
when did you write to frederick margaret
yesterday or the day before  yesterday mamma  yesterday and the letter went  yes
i took it myself  oh margaret im so afraid of his coming
if he should be recognized
if he should be taken
if he should be executed after all these years that he has kept away and lived in safety
i keep falling asleep and dreaming that he is caught and being tried  oh mamma dont be afraid
there will be some risk no doubt but we will lessen it as much as ever we can
and it is so little
now if we were at helstone there would be twentya hundred times as much
there everybody would remember him and if there was a stranger known to be in the house they would be sure to guess it was frederick while here nobody knows or cares for us enough to notice what we do
dixon will keep the door like a dragonwont you dixonwhile he is here  theyll be clever if they come in past me said dixon showing her teeth at the bare idea
and he need not go out except in the dusk poor fellow  poor fellow echoed mrs hale
but i almost wish you had not written
would it be too late to stop him if you wrote again margaret  im afraid it would mamma said margaret remembering the urgency with which she had entreated him to come directly if he wished to see his mother alive
i always dislike that doing things in such a hurry said mrs hale
margaret was silent
come now maam said dixon with a kind of cheerful authority you know seeing master frederick is just the very thing of all others youre longing for
and im glad miss margaret wrote off straight without shillyshallying
ive had a great mind to do it myself
and well keep him snug depend upon it
theres only martha in the house that would not do a good deal to save him on a pinch and ive been thinking she might go and see her mother just at that very time
shes been saying once or twice she should like to go for her mother has had a stroke since she came here only she didnt like to ask
but ill see about her being safe off as soon as we know when he comes god bless him
so take your tea maam in comfort and trust to me  mrs hale did trust in dixon more than in margaret
dixons words quieted her for the time
margaret poured out the tea in silence trying to think of something agreeable to say but her thoughts made answer something like daniel orourke when the maninthe moon asked him to get off his reapinghook
the more you ax us the more we wont stir the more she tried to think of somethinganything besides the danger to which frederick would be exposedthe more closely her imagination clung to the unfortunate idea presented to her
her mother prattled with dixon and seemed to have utterly forgotten the possibility of frederick being tried and executedutterly forgotten that at her wish if by margarets deed he was summoned into this danger
her mother was one of those who throw out terrible possibilities miserable probabilities unfortunate chances of all kinds as a rocket throws out sparks but if the sparks light on some combustible matter they smoulder first and burst out into a frightful flame at last
margaret was glad when her filial duties gently and carefully performed she could go down into the study
she wondered how her father and higgins had got on
in the first place the decorous kindhearted simple oldfashioned gentleman had unconsciously called out by his own refinement and courteousness of manner all the latent courtesy in the other
mr hale treated all his fellowcreatures alike it never entered into his head to make any difference because of their rank
he placed a chair for nicholas stood up till he at mr hales request took a seat and called him invariably mr
higgins instead of the curt nicholas or higgins to which the drunken infidel weaver had been accustomed
but nicholas was neither an habitual drunkard nor a thorough infidel
he drank to drown care as he would have himself expressed it and he was infidel so far as he had never yet found any form of faith to which he could attach himself heart and soul
margaret was a little surprised and very much pleased when she found her father and higgins in earnest conversationeach speaking with gentle politeness to the other however their opinions might clash
nicholasclean tidied if only at the pumptrough and quiet spokenwas a new creature to her who had only seen him in the rough independence of his own hearthstone
he had slicked his hair down with the fresh water he had adjusted his neckhandkerchief and borrowed an odd candleend to polish his clogs with and there he sat enforcing some opinion on her father with a strong darkshire accent it is true but with a lowered voice and a good earnest composure on his face
her father too was interested in what his companion was saying
he looked round as she came in smiled and quietly gave her his chair and then sat down afresh as quickly as possible and with a little bow of apology to his guest for the interruption
higgins nodded to her as a sign of greeting and she softly adjusted her working materials on the table and prepared to listen
as i was asaying sir i reckon yod not ha much belief in yo if yo lived hereif yod been bred here
i ax your pardon if i use wrong words but what i mean by belief just now is athinking on sayings and maxims and promises made by folk yo never saw about the things and the life yo never saw nor no one else
now yo say these are true things and true sayings and a true life
i just say wheres the proof
theres many and many a one wiser and scores better learned than i am around mefolk whove had time to think on these thingswhile my time has had to be gien up to getting my bread
well i sees these people
their lives is pretty much open to me
theyre real folk
they dont believe i the biblenot they
they may say they do for forms sake but lord sir dye think their first cry i th morning is what shall i do to get hold on eternal life or what shall i do to fill my purse this blessed day
where shall i go
what bargains shall i strike the purse and the gold and the notes is real things things as can be felt and touched thems realities and eternal life is all a talk very fit fori ax your pardon sir yor a parson out o work i believe
well
ill never speak disrespectful of a man in the same fix as im in mysel
but ill just ax yo another question sir and i dunnot want yo to answer it only to put in yor pipe and smoke it afore yo go for to set down us who only believe in what we see as fools and noddies
if salvation and life to come and what not was truenot in mens words but in mens hearts coredun yo not think theyd din us wi it as they do wi political conomy
theyre mighty anxious to come round us wi that piece o wisdom but tother would be a greater convarsion if it were true  but the masters have nothing to do with your religion
all that they are connected with you in is tradeso they thinkand all that it concerns them therefore to rectify your opinions in is the science of trade  im glad sir said higgins with a curious wink of his eye that yo put in so they think id ha thought yo a hyprocrite im afeard if yo hadnt for all yor a parson or rayther because yor a parson
yo see if yod spoken o religion as a thing that if it was true it didnt concern all men to press on all mens attention above everything else in this varsal earth i should ha thought yo a knave for to be a parson and id rather think yo a fool than a knave
no offence i hope sir  none at all
you consider me mistaken and i consider you far more fatally mistaken
i dont expect to convince you in a daynot in one conversation but let us know each other and speak freely to each other about these things and the truth will prevail
i should not believe in god if i did not believe that
mr higgins i trust whatever else you have given up you believemr hales voice dropped low in reverenceyou believe in him  nicholas higgins suddenly stood straight stiff up
margaret started to her feetfor she thought by the working of his face he was going into convulsions
mr hale looked at her dismayed
at last higgins found words  man
i could fell yo to the ground for tempting me
whatten business have yo to try me wi your doubts
think o her lying theere after the life hoos led and think then how yod deny me the one sole comfort leftthat there is a god and that he set her her life
i dunnot believe shell ever live again said he sitting down and drearily going on as if to the unsympathising fire
i dunnot believe in any other life than this in which she dreed such trouble and had such neverending care and i cannot bear to think it were all a set o chances that might ha been altered wi a breath o wind
theres many a time when ive thought i didna believe in god but ive never put it fair out before me in words as many men do
i may ha laughed at those who did to brave it out likebut i have looked round at after to see if he heard me if so be there was a he but today when im left desolate i wunnot listen to yo wi yor questions and yor doubts
theres but one thing steady and quiet i all this reeling world and reason or no reason ill cling to that
its a very well for happy folk  margaret touched his arm very softly
she had not spoken before nor had he heard her rise
nicholas we do not want to reason you misunderstand my father
we do not reasonwe believe and so do you
it is the one sole comfort in such times  he turned round and caught her hand
ay
it is it isbrushing away the tears with the back of his handbut yo know shes lying dead at home and im welly dazed wi sorrow and at times i hardly know what im saying
its as if speeches folk ha madeclever and smart things as ive thought at the timecome up now my hearts welly brossen
th strikes failed as well dun yo know that miss
i were coming whoam to ask her like a beggar as i am for a bit o comfort i that trouble and i were knocked down by one who telled me she were deadjust dead
that were all but that were enough for me  mr hale blew his nose and got up to snuff the candles in order to conceal his emotion
hes not an infidel margaret how could you say so muttered he reproachfully
ive a good mind to read him the fourteenth chapter of job  not yet papa i think
perhaps not at all
let us ask him about the strike and give him all the sympathy he needs and hoped to have from poor bessy  so they questioned and listened
the workmens calculations were based like too many of the masters on false premises
they reckoned on their fellowmen as if they possessed the calculable powers of machines no more no less no allowance for human passions getting the better of reason as in the case of boucher and the rioters and believing that the representations of their injuries would have the same effect on strangers far away as the injuries fancied or real had upon themselves
they were consequently surprised and indignant at the poor irish who had allowed themselves to be imported and brought over to take their places
this indignation was tempered in some degree by contempt for them irishers and by pleasure at the idea of the bungling way in which they would set to work and perplex their new masters with their ignorance and stupidity strange exaggerated stories of which were already spreading through the town
but the most cruel cut of all was that of the milton workmen who had defied and disobeyed the commands of the union to keep the peace whatever came who had originated discord in the camp and spread the panic of the law being arrayed against them
and so the strike is at an end said margaret
ay miss
its save as save can
th factory doors will need open wide tomorrow to let in all wholl be axing for work if its only just to show theyd nought to do wi a measure which if wed been made o th right stuff would ha brought wages up to a point theyn not been at this ten year  youll get work shant you asked margaret
youre a famous workman are not you  hamperll let me work at his mill when he cuts off his right handnot before and not after said nicholas quietly
margaret was silenced and sad
about the wages said mr hale
youll not be offended but i think you make some sad mistakes
i should like to read you some remarks in a book i have he got up and went to his bookshelves
yo neednt trouble yoursel sir said nicholas
their bookstuff goes in at one ear and out at tother
i can make nought ont
afore hamper and me had this split th overlooker telled him i were stirring up th men to ask for higher wages and hamper met me one day in th yard
hed a thin book i his hand and says he higgins im told youre one o those damned fools that think you can get higher wages for asking for em ay and keep em up too when youve forced em up
now ill give yo a chance and try if yove any sense in yo heres a book written by a friend o mine and if yoll read it yoll see how wages find their own level without either masters or men having aught to do with them except the men cut their own throats wi striking like the confounded noodles they are well now sir i put it to yo being a parson and having been in th preaching line and having had to try and bring folk oer to what yo thought was a right way o thinkingdid yo begin by calling em fools and such like or didnt yo rayther give em such kind words at first to make em ready for to listen and be convinced if they could and in yor preaching did yo stop every now and then and say half to them and half to yorsel but yor such a pack o fools that ive a strong notion its no use my trying to put sense into yo i were not i th best state ill own for taking in what hampers friend had to sayi were so vexed at the way it were put to mebut i thought come ill see what these chaps has got to say and try if its them or me as is th noodle so i took th book and tugged at it but lord bless yo it went on about capital and labour and labour and capital till it fair sent me off to sleep
i neer could rightly fix i my mind which was which and it spoke on em as if they was vartues or vices and what i wanted for to know were the rights o men whether they were rich or poorso be they only were men  but for all that said mr hale and granting to the full the offensiveness the folly the unchristianness of mr hampers way of speaking to you in recommending his friends book yet if it told you what he said it did that wages find their own level and that the most successful strike can only force them up for a moment to sink in far greater proportion afterwards in consequence of that very strike the book would have told you the truth  well sir said higgins rather doggedly it might or it might not
theres two opinions go to settling that point
but suppose it was truth double strong it were no truth to me if i couldna take it in
i daresay theres great truth in yon latin book on your shelves but its gibberish and not truth to me unless i know the meaning o the words
if yo sir or any other knowledgable patient man comes to me and says hell larn me what the words mean and not blow me up if im a bit stupid or forget how one thing hangs on anotherwhy in time i may get to see the truth of it or i may not
ill not be bound to say i shall end in thinking the same as any man
and im not one who think truth can be shaped out in words all neat and clean as th men at th foundry cut out sheetiron
same bones wont go down wi every one
itll stick here i this mans throat and there i tothers
let alone that when down it may be too strong for this one too weak for that
folk who sets up to doctor th world wi their truth mun suit different for different minds and be a bit tender i th way of giving it too or the poor sick fools may spit it out i their faces
now hamper first gies me a box on my ear and then he throws his big bolus at me and says he reckons itll do me no good im such a fool but there it is  i wish some of the kindest and wisest of the masters would meet some of you men and have a good talk on these things it would surely be the best way of getting over your difficulties which i do believe arise from your ignoranceexcuse me mr higginson subjects which it is for the mutual interests of both masters and men should be well understood by both
i wonderhalf to his daughter if mr thornton might not be induced to do such thing  remember papa said she in a very low voice what he said one dayabout governments you know she was unwilling to make any clearer allusion to the conversation they had held on the mode of governing workpeopleby giving men intelligence enough to rule themselves or by a wise despotism on the part of the masterfor she saw that higgins had caught mr thorntons name if not the whole of the speech indeed he began to speak of him
thornton
hes the chap as wrote off at once for these irishers and led to th riot that ruined th strike
even hamper wi all his bullying would ha waited a whilebut its a word and a blow wi thornton
and now when th union would ha thanked him for following up th chase after boucher and them chaps as went right again our commands its thornton who steps forrard and coolly says that as th strikes at an end he as party injured doesnt want to press the charge again the rioters
i thought hed ha carried his point and had his revenge in an open way but says he one in court telled me his very words they are well known they will find the natural punishment of their conduct in the difficulty they will meet wi in getting employment
that will be severe enough i only wish theyd cotched boucher and had him up before hamper
i see th oud tiger setting on him
would he ha let him off
not he  mr
thornton was right said margaret
you are angry against boucher nicholas or else you would be the first to see that where the natural punishment would be severe enough for the offence any farther punishment would be something like revenge  my daughter is no great friend of mr thorntons said mr hale smiling at margaret while she as red as any carnation began to work with double diligence but i believe what she says is the truth
i like him for it  well sir this strike has been a weary bit o business to me and yoll not wonder if im a bit put out wi seeing it fail just for a few men who would na suffer in silence and aoud out brave and firm  you forget said margaret
i dont know much of boucher but the only time i saw him it was not his own sufferings he spoke of but those of his sick wifehis little children  true
but he were not made of iron himsel
hed ha cried out for his own sorrows next
he were not one to bear  how came he into the union asked margaret innocently
you dont seem to have much respect for him nor gained much good from having him in  higginss brow clouded
he was silent for a minute or two
then he said shortly enough  its not for me to speak o th union
what they does they does
them that is of a trade mun hang together and if theyre not willing to take their chance along wi th rest th union has ways and means  mr hale saw that higgins was vexed at the turn the conversation had taken and was silent
not so margaret though she saw higginss feeling as clearly as he did
by instinct she felt that if he could but be brought to express himself in plain words something clear would be gained on which to argue for the right and the just
and what are the unions ways and means  he looked up at her as if on the point of dogged resistance to her wish for information
but her calm face fixed on his patient and trustful compelled him to answer
well
if a man doesnt belong to th union them as works next looms as orders not to speak to himif hes sorry or ill its a the same hes out o bounds hes none o us he comes among us he works among us but hes none o us
i some places thems fined who speaks to him
yo try that miss try living a year or two among them as looks away if yo look at em try working within two yards o crowds o men who yo know have a grinding grudge at yo in their heartsto whom if yo say yor glad not an eye brightens nor a lip movesto whom if your hearts heavy yo can never say nought because theyll neer take notice on your sighs or sad looks and a mans no man wholl groan out loud bout folk asking him whats the matter
just yo try that missten hours for three hundred days and yoll know a bit what the union is  why said margaret what tyranny this is
nay higgins i dont care one straw for your anger
i know you cant be angry with me if you would and i must tell you the truth that i never read in all the history i have read of a more slow lingering torture than this
and you belong to the union
and you talk of the tyranny of the masters  nay said higgins yo may say what yo like
the dead stand between yo and every angry word o mine
dye think i forget whos lying there and how hoo loved yo
and its th masters as has made us sin if th union is a sin
not this generation maybe but their fathers
their fathers ground our fathers to the very dust ground us to powder
parson
i reckon ive heerd my mother read out a text the fathers have eaten sour grapes and th chidrens teeth are set on edge its so wi them
in those days of sore oppression th unions began it were a necessity
its a necessity now according to me
its a withstanding of injustice past present or to come
it may be like war along wi it come crimes but i think it were a greater crime to let it alone
our only chance is binding men together in one common interest and if some are cowards and some are fools they mun come along and join the great march whose only strength is in numbers  oh said mr hale sighing your union in itself would be beautiful gloriousit would be christianity itselfif it were but for an end which affected the good of all instead of that of merely one class as opposed to another  i reckon its time for me to be going sir said higgins as the clock struck ten
home said margaret very softly
he understood her and took her offered hand
home miss
yo may trust me tho i am one o th union  i do trust you most thoroughly nicholas  stay said mr hale hurrying to the bookshelves
mr
higgins
im sure youll join us in family prayer  higgins looked at margaret doubtfully
her grave sweet eyes met his there was no compulsion only deep interest in them
he did not speak but he kept his place
margaret the churchwoman her father the dissenter higgins the infidel knelt down together
it did them no harm
a ray of sunshine
some wishes crossed my mind and dimly cheered it     and one or two poor melancholy pleasures     each in the pale unwarming light of hope     silvering its flimsy wing flew silent by     moths in the moonbeam               coleridge
the next morning brought margaret a letter from edith
it was affectionate and inconsequent like the writer
but the affection was charming to margarets own affectionate nature and she had grown up with the inconsequence so she did not perceive it
it was as follows  oh margaret it is worth a journey from england to see my boy
he is a superb little fellow especially in his caps and most especially in the one you sent him you good daintyfingered persevering little lady
having made all the mothers here envious i want to show him to somebody new and hear a fresh set of admiring expressions perhaps thats all the reason perhaps it is notnay possibly there is just a little cousinly love mixed with it but i do want you so much to come here margaret
im sure it would be the very best thing for aunt hales health everybody here is young and well and our skies are always blue and our sun always shines and the band plays deliciously from morning till night and to come back to the burden of my ditty my baby always smiles
i am constantly wanting you to draw him from me margaret
it does not signify what he is doing that very thing is prettiest gracefullest best
i think i love him a great deal better than my husband who is getting stout and grumpywhat he calls busy no
he is not
he has just come in with news of such a charming picnic given by the officers of the hazard at anchor in the bay below
because he has brought in such a pleasant piece of news i retract all i said just now
did not somebody burn his hand for having said or done something he was sorry for
well i cant burn mine because it would hurt me and the scar would be ugly but ill retract all i said as fast as i can
cosmo is quite as great a darling as baby and not a bit stout and as ungrumpy as ever husband was only sometimes he is very very busy
i may say that without lovewifely duty where was ii had something very particular to say i know once
oh it is thisdearest margaretyou must come and see me it would do aunt hale good as i said before
get the doctor to order it for her
tell him that its the smoke of milton that does her harm
i have no doubt it is that really
three months you must not come for less of this delicious climateall sunshine and grapes as common as blackberries would quite cure her
i dont ask my unclehere the letter became more constrained and better written
mr hale was in the corner like a naughty child for having given up his living
because i dare say he disapproves of war soldiers and bands of music at least i know that many dissenters are members of the peace society and i am afraid he would not like to come but if he would dear pray say that cosmo and i will do our best to make him happy and ill hide up cosmos red coat and sword and make the band play all sorts of grave solemn things or if they do play pomps and vanities it shall be in double slow time
dear margaret if he would like to accompany you and aunt hale we will try and make it pleasant though im rather afraid of any one who has done anything for conscience sake
you never did i hope
tell aunt hale not to bring any warm clothes though im afraid it will be late in the year before you can come
but you have no idea of the heat here
i tried to wear my great beauty indian shawl at a picnic
i kept myself up with proverbs as long as i could pride must abideand such wholesome pieces of pith but it was no use
i was like mammas little dog tiny with an elephants trappings on smothered hidden killed with my finery so i made it into a capital carpet for us all to sit down upon
heres this boy of mine margaretif you dont pack up your things as soon as you get this letter and come straight off to see him i shall think youre descended from king herod  margaret did long for a day of ediths lifeher freedom from care her cheerful home her sunny skies
if a wish could have transported her she would have gone off just for one day
she yearned for the strength which such a change would giveeven for a few hours to be in the midst of that bright life and to feel young again
not yet twenty
and she had had to bear up against such hard pressure that she felt quite old
that was her first feeling after reading ediths letter
then she read it again and forgetting herself was amused at its likeness to ediths self and was laughing merrily over it when mrs hale came into the drawingroom leaning on dixons arm
margaret flew to adjust the pillows
her mother seemed more than usually feeble
what were you laughing at margaret asked she as soon as she had recovered from the exertion of settling herself on the sofa
a letter i have had this morning from edith
shall i read it to you mamma  she read it aloud and for a time it seemed to interest her mother who kept wondering what name edith had given to her boy and suggesting all probable names and all possible reasons why each and all of these names should be given
into the very midst of these wonders mr thornton came bringing another offering of fruit for mrs hale
he could notsay rather he would notdeny himself the chance of the pleasure of seeing margaret
he had no end in this but the present gratification
it was the sturdy wilfulness of a man usually most reasonable and selfcontrolled
he entered the room taking in at a glance the fact of margarets presence but after the first cold distant bow he never seemed to let his eyes fall on her again
he only stayed to present his peachesto speak some gentle kindly wordsand then his cold offended eyes met margarets with a grave farewell as he left the room
she sat down silent and pale
do you know margaret i really begin to like mr thornton  no answer at first
then margaret forced out an icy do you  yes
i think he is really getting quite polished in his manners  margarets voice was more in order now
she replied  he is very kind and attentivethere is no doubt of that  i wonder mrs thornton never calls
she must know i am ill because of the waterbed  i dare say she hears how you are from her son  still i should like to see her
you have so few friends here margaret  margaret felt what was in her mothers thoughtsa tender craving to bespeak the kindness of some woman towards the daughter that might soon be left motherless
but she could not speak
do you think said mrs hale after a pause that you could go and ask mrs thornton to come and see me
only oncei dont want to be troublesome  i will do anything if you wish it mammabut ifbut when frederick comes  ah to be sure
we must keep our doors shutwe must let no one in
i hardly know whether i dare wish him to come or not
sometimes i think i would rather not
sometimes i have such frightful dreams about him  oh mamma
well take good care
i will put my arm in the bolt sooner than he should come to the slightest harm
trust the care of him to me mamma
i will watch over him like a lioness over her young  when can we hear from him  not for a week yet certainlyperhaps more  we must send martha away in good time
it would never do to have her here when he comes and then send her off in a hurry  dixon is sure to remind us of that
i was thinking that if we wanted any help in the house while he is here we could perhaps get mary higgins
she is very slack of work and is a good girl and would take pains to do her best i am sure and would sleep at home and need never come upstairs so as to know who is in the house  as you please
as dixon pleases
but margaret dont get to use these horrid milton words
slack of work it is a provincialism
what will your aunt shaw say if she hears you use it on her return  oh mamma
dont try and make a bugbear of aunt shaw said margaret laughing
edith picked up all sorts of military slang from captain lennox and aunt shaw never took any notice of it  but yours is factory slang  and if i live in a factory town i must speak factory language when i want it
why mamma i could astonish you with a great many words you never heard in your life
i dont believe you know what a knobstick is  not i child
i only know it has a very vulgar sound and i dont want to hear you using it  very well dearest mother i wont
only i shall have to use a whole explanatory sentence instead  i dont like this milton said mrs hale
edith is right enough in saying its the smoke that has made me so ill  margaret started up as her mother said this
her father had just entered the room and she was most anxious that the faint impression she had seen on his mind that the milton air had injured her mothers health should not be deepenedshould not receive any confirmation
she could not tell whether he had heard what mrs hale had said or not but she began speaking hurriedly of other things unaware that mr thornton was following him
mamma is accusing me of having picked up a great deal of vulgarity since we came to milton  the vulgarity margaret spoke of referred purely to the use of local words and the expression arose out of the conversation they had just been holding
but mr thorntons brow darkened and margaret suddenly felt how her speech might be misunderstood by him so in the natural sweet desire to avoid giving unnecessary pain she forced herself to go forwards with a little greeting and continue what she was saying addressing herself to him expressly
now mr thornton though knobstick has not a very pretty sound is it not expressive
could i do without it in speaking of the thing it represents
if using local words is vulgar i was very vulgar in the forestwas i not mamma  it was unusual with margaret to obtrude her own subject of conversation on others but in this case she was so anxious to prevent mr thornton from feeling annoyance at the words he had accidentally overheard that it was not until she had done speaking that she coloured all over with consciousness more especially as mr thornton seemed hardly to understand the exact gist or bearing of what she was saying but passed her by with a cold reserve of ceremonious movement to speak to mrs hale
the sight of him reminded her of the wish to see his mother and commend margaret to her care
margaret sitting in burning silence vexed and ashamed of her difficulty in keeping her right place and her calm unconsciousness of heart when mr thornton was by heard her mothers slow entreaty that mrs thornton would come and see her see her soon tomorrow if it were possible
mr thornton promised that she shouldconversed a little and then took his leave and margarets movements and voice seemed at once released from some invisible chains
he never looked at her and yet the careful avoidance of his eyes betokened that in some way he knew exactly where if they fell by chance they would rest on her
if she spoke he gave no sign of attention and yet his next speech to any one else was modified by what she had said sometimes there was an express answer to what she had remarked but given to another person as though unsuggested by her
it was not the bad manners of ignorance it was the wilful bad manners arising from deep offence
it was wilful at the time repented of afterwards
but no deep plan no careful cunning could have stood him in such good stead
margaret thought about him more than she had ever done before not with any tinge of what is called love but with regret that she had wounded him so deeplyand with a gentle patient striving to return to their former position of antagonistic friendship for a friends position was what she found that he had held in her regard as well as in that of the rest of the family
there was a pretty humility in her behaviour to him as if mutely apologising for the overstrong words which were the reaction from the deeds of the day of the riot
but he resented those words bitterly
they rung in his ears and he was proud of the sense of justice which made him go in every kindness he could offer to her parents
he exulted in the power he showed in compelling himself to face her whenever he could think of any action which might give her father or mother pleasure
he thought that he disliked seeing one who had mortified him so keenly but he was mistaken
it was a stinging pleasure to be in the room with her and feel her presence
but he was no great analyser of his own motives and was mistaken as i have said
home at last
the saddest birds a season find to sing               southwell
never to fold the robe oer secret pain     never weighed down by memorys clouds again     to bow thy head
thou art gone home               mrs hemans
mrs thornton came to see mrs hale the next morning
she was much worse
one of those sudden changesthose great visible strides towards death had been taken in the night and her own family were startled by the gray sunken look her features had assumed in that one twelve hours of suffering
mrs thorntonwho had not seen her for weekswas softened all at once
she had come because her son asked it from her as a personal favour but with all the proud bitter feelings of her nature in arms against that family of which margaret formed one
she doubted the reality of mrs hales illness she doubted any want beyond a momentary fancy on that ladys part which should take her out of her previously settled course of employment for the day
she told her son that she wished they had never come near the place that he had never got acquainted with them that there had been no such useless languages as latin and greek ever invented
he bore all this pretty silently but when she had ended her invective against the dead languages he quietly returned to the short curt decided expression of his wish that she should go and see mrs hale at the time appointed as most likely to be convenient to the invalid
mrs thornton submitted with as bad a grace as she could to her sons desire all the time liking him the better for having it and exaggerating in her own mind the same notion that he had of extraordinary goodness on his part in so perseveringly keeping up with the hales
his goodness verging on weakness as all the softer virtues did in her mind and her own contempt for mr and mrs hale and positive dislike to margaret were the ideas which occupied mrs thornton till she was struck into nothingness before the dark shadow of the wings of the angel of death
there lay mrs halea mother like herselfa much younger woman than she wason the bed from which there was no sign of hope that she might ever rise again
no more variety of light and shade for her in that darkened room no power of action scarcely change of movement faint alternations of whispered sound and studious silence and yet that monotonous life seemed almost too much
when mrs thornton strong and prosperous with life came in mrs hale lay still although from the look on her face she was evidently conscious of who it was
but she did not even open her eyes for a minute or two
the heavy moisture of tears stood on her eyelashes before she looked up then with her hand groping feebly over the bedclothes for the touch of mrs thorntons large firm fingers she said scarcely above her breathmrs
thornton had to stoop from her erectness to listen  margaretyou have a daughtermy sister is in italy
my child will be without a motherin a strange placeif i die will you  and her filmy wandering eyes fixed themselves with an intensity of wistfulness on mrs thorntons face
for a minute there was no change in its rigidness it was stern and unmovednay but that the eyes of the sick woman were growing dim with the slowgathering tears she might have seen a dark cloud cross the cold features
and it was no thought of her son or of her living daughter fanny that stirred her heart at last but a sudden remembrance suggested by something in the arrangement of the roomof a little daughterdead in infancylong years agothat like a sudden sunbeam melted the icy crust behind which there was a real tender woman
you wish me to be a friend to miss hale said mrs thornton in her measured voice that would not soften with her heart but came out distinct and clear
mrs hale her eyes still fixed on mrs thorntons face pressed the hand that lay below hers on the coverlet
she could not speak
mrs thornton sighed i will be a true friend if circumstances require it
not a tender friend
that i cannot beto her she was on the point of adding but she relented at the sight of that poor anxious face
it is not my nature to show affection even where i feel it nor do i volunteer advice in general
still at your requestif it will be any comfort to you i will promise you then came a pause
mrs thornton was too conscientious to promise what she did not mean to perform and to perform anything in the way of kindness on behalf of margaret more disliked at this moment than ever was difficult almost impossible
i promise said she with grave severity which after all inspired the dying woman with faith as in something more stable than life itselfflickering flittering wavering life
i promise that in any difficulty in which miss hale  call her margaret gasped mrs hale
in which she comes to me for help i will help her with every power i have as if she were my own daughter
i also promise that if ever i see her doing what i think is wrong  but margaret never does wrongnot wilfully wrong pleaded mrs hale
mrs thornton went on as before as if she had not heard  if ever i see her doing what i believe to be wrongsuch wrong not touching me or mine in which case i might be supposed to have an interested motivei will tell her of it faithfully and plainly as i should wish my own daughter to be told  there was a long pause
mrs hale felt that this promise did not include all and yet it was much
it had reservations in it which she did not understand but then she was weak dizzy and tired
mrs thornton was reviewing all the probable cases in which she had pledged herself to act
she had a fierce pleasure in the idea of telling margaret unwelcome truths in the shape of performance of duty
mrs hale began to speak  i thank you
i pray god to bless you
i shall never see you again in this world
but my last words are i thank you for your promise of kindness to my child  not kindness testified mrs thornton ungraciously truthful to the last
but having eased her conscience by saying these words she was not sorry that they were not heard
she pressed mrs hales soft languid hand and rose up and went her way out of the house without seeing a creature
during the time that mrs thornton was having this interview with mrs hale margaret and dixon were laying their heads together and consulting how they should keep fredericks coming a profound secret to all out of the house
a letter from him might now be expected any day and he would assuredly follow quickly on its heels
martha must be sent away on her holiday dixon must keep stern guard on the front door only admitting the few visitors that ever came to the house into mr hales room down stairsmrs hales extreme illness giving her a good excuse for this
if mary higgins was required as a help to dixon in the kitchen she was to hear and see as little of frederick as possible and he was if necessary to be spoken of to her under the name of mr dickinson
but her sluggish and incurious nature was the greatest safeguard of all
they resolved that martha should leave them that very afternoon for this visit to her mother
margaret wished that she had been sent away on the previous day as she fancied it might be thought strange to give a servant a holiday when her mistresss state required so much attendance
poor margaret
all that afternoon she had to act the part of a roman daughter and give strength out of her own scanty stock to her father
mr hale would hope would not despair between the attacks of his wifes malady he buoyed himself up in every respite from her pain and believed that it was the beginning of ultimate recovery
and so when the paroxysms came on each more severe than the last they were fresh agonies and greater disappointments to him
this afternoon he sat in the drawingroom unable to bear the solitude of his study or to employ himself in any way
he buried his head in his arms which lay folded on the table
margarets heart ached to see him yet as he did not speak she did not like to volunteer any attempt at comfort
martha was gone
dixon sat with mrs hale while she slept
the house was very still and quiet and darkness came on without any movement to procure candles
margaret sat at the window looking out at the lamps and the street but seeing nothingonly alive to her fathers heavy sighs
she did not like to go down for lights lest the tacit restraint of her presence being withdrawn he might give way to more violent emotion without her being at hand to comfort him
yet she was just thinking that she ought to go and see after the welldoing of the kitchen fire which there was nobody but herself to attend to when she heard the muffled doorbell ring with so violent a pull that the wires jingled all through the house though the positive sound was not great
she started up passed her father who had never moved at the veiled dull soundreturned and kissed him tenderly
and still he never moved nor took any notice of her fond embrace
then she went down softly through the dark to the door
dixon would have put the chain on before she opened it but margaret had not a thought of fear in her preoccupied mind
a mans tall figure stood between her and the luminous street
he was looking away but at the sound of the latch he turned quickly round
is this mr hales said he in a clear full delicate voice
margaret trembled all over at first she did not answer
in a moment she sighed out  frederick and stretched out both her hands to catch his and draw him in
oh margaret said he holding her off by her shoulders after they had kissed each other as if even in that darkness he could see her face and read in its expression a quicker answer to his question than words could give  my mother
is she alive  yes she is alive dear dear brother
sheas ill as she can be she is but alive
she is alive  thank god said he
papa is utterly prostrate with this great grief  you expect me dont you  no we have had no letter  then i have come before it
but my mother knows i am coming  oh
we all knew you would come
but wait a little
step in here
give me your hand
what is this
oh
your carpetbag
dixon has shut the shutters but this is papas study and i can take you to a chair to rest yourself for a few minutes while i go and tell him  she groped her way to the taper and the lucifer matches
she suddenly felt shy when the little feeble light made them visible
all she could see was that her brothers face was unusually dark in complexion and she caught the stealthy look of a pair of remarkably longcut blue eyes that suddenly twinkled up with a droll consciousness of their mutual purpose of inspecting each other
but though the brother and sister had an instant of sympathy in their reciprocal glances they did not exchange a word only margaret felt sure that she should like her brother as a companion as much as she already loved him as a near relation
her heart was wonderfully lighter as she went up stairs the sorrow was no less in reality but it became less oppressive from having some one in precisely the same relation to it as that in which she stood
not her fathers desponding attitude had power to damp her now
he lay across the table helpless as ever but she had the spell by which to rouse him
she used it perhaps too violently in her own great relief
papa said she throwing her arms fondly round his neck pulling his weary head up in fact with her gentle violence till it rested in her arms and she could look into his eyes and let them gain strength and assurance from hers
papa
guess who is here  he looked at her she saw the idea of the truth glimmer into their filmy sadness and be dismissed thence as a wild imagination
he threw himself forward and hid his face once more in his stretchedout arms resting upon the table as heretofore
she heard him whisper she bent tenderly down to listen
i dont know dont tell me it is fredericknot frederick
i cannot bear iti am too weak
and his mother is dying  he began to cry and wail like a child
it was so different to all which margaret had hoped and expected that she turned sick with disappointment and was silent for an instant
then she spoke againvery differentlynot so exultingly far more tenderly and carefully
papa it is frederick
think of mamma how glad she will be
and oh for her sake how glad we ought to be
for his sake tooour poor poor boy  her father did not change his attitude but he seemed to be trying to understand the fact
where is he asked he at last his face still hidden in his prostrate arms
in your study quite alone
i lighted the taper and ran up to tell you
he is quite alone and will be wondering why  i will go to him broke in her father and he lifted himself up and leant on her arm as on that of a guide
margaret led him to the study door but her spirits were so agitated that she felt she could not bear to see the meeting
she turned away and ran up stairs and cried most heartily
it was the first time she had dared to allow herself this relief for days
the strain had been terrible as she now felt
but frederick was come
he the one precious brother was there safe amongst them again
she could hardly believe it
she stopped her crying and opened her bedroom door
she heard no sound of voices and almost feared she might have dreamt
she went down stairs and listened at the study door
she heard the buzz of voices and that was enough
she went into the kitchen and stirred up the fire and lighted the house and prepared for the wanderers refreshment
how fortunate it was that her mother slept
she knew that she did from the candlelighter thrust through the keyhole of her bedroom door
the traveller could be refreshed and bright and the first excitement of the meeting with his father all be over before her mother became aware of anything unusual
when all was ready margaret opened the study door and went in like a servingmaiden with a heavy tray held in her extended arms
she was proud of serving frederick
but he when he saw her sprang up in a minute and relieved her of her burden
it was a type a sign of all the coming relief which his presence would bring
the brother and sister arranged the table together saying little but their hands touching and their eyes speaking the natural language of expression so intelligible to those of the same blood
the fire had gone out and margaret applied herself to light it for the evenings had begun to be chilly and yet it was desirable to make all noises as distant as possible from mrs hales room
dixon says it is a gift to light a fire not an art to be acquired  poeta nascitur non fit murmured mr hale and margaret was glad to hear a quotation once more however languidly given
dear old dixon
how we shall kiss each other said frederick
she used to kiss me and then look in my face to be sure i was the right person and then set to again
but margaret what a bungler you are
i never saw such a little awkward goodfornothing pair of hands
run away and wash them ready to cut breadandbutter for me and leave the fire
ill manage it
lighting fires is one of my natural accomplishments  so margaret went away and returned and passed in and out of the room in a glad restlessness that could not be satisfied with sitting still
the more wants frederick had the better she was pleased and he understood all this by instinct
it was a joy snatched in the house of mourning and the zest of it was all the more pungent because they knew in the depth of their hearts what irremediable sorrow awaited them
in the middle they heard dixons foot on the stairs
mr hale started from his languid posture in his great armchair from which he had been watching his children in a dreamy way as if they were acting some drama of happiness which it was pretty to look at but which was distinct from reality and in which he had no part
he stood up and faced the door showing such a strange sudden anxiety to conceal frederick from the sight of any person entering even though it were the faithful dixon that a shiver came over margarets heart it reminded her of the new fear in their lives
she caught at fredericks arm and clutched it tight while a stern thought compressed her brow and caused her to set her teeth
and yet they knew it was only dixons measured tread
they heard her walk the length of the passageinto the kitchen
margaret rose up
i will go to her and tell her
and i shall hear how mamma is mrs hale was awake
she rambled at first but after they had given her some tea she was refreshed though not disposed to talk
it was better that the night should pass over before she was told of her sons arrival
dr donaldsons appointed visit would bring nervous excitement enough for the evening and he might tell them how to prepare her for seeing frederick
he was there in the house could be summoned at any moment
margaret could not sit still
it was a relief to her to aid dixon in all her preparations for master frederick it seemed as though she never could be tired again
each glimpse into the room where he sate by his father conversing with him about she knew not what nor cared to knowwas increase of strength to her
her own time for talking and hearing would come at last and she was too certain of this to feel in a hurry to grasp it now
she took in his appearance and liked it
he had delicate features redeemed from effeminacy by the swarthiness of his complexion and his quick intensity of expression
his eyes were generally merrylooking but at times they and his mouth so suddenly changed and gave her such an idea of latent passion that it almost made her afraid
but this look was only for an instant and had in it no doggedness no vindictiveness it was rather the instantaneous ferocity of expression that comes over the countenances of all natives of wild or southern countriesa ferocity which enhances the charm of the childlike softness into which such a look may melt away
margaret might fear the violence of the impulsive nature thus occasionally betrayed but there was nothing in it to make her distrust or recoil in the least from the newfound brother
on the contrary all their intercourse was peculiarly charming to her from the very first
she knew then how much responsibility she had had to bear from the exquisite sensation of relief which she felt in fredericks presence
he understood his father and mothertheir characters and their weaknesses and went along with a careless freedom which was yet most delicately careful not to hurt or wound any of their feelings
he seemed to know instinctively when a little of the natural brilliancy of his manner and conversation would not jar on the deep depression of his father or might relieve his mothers pain
whenever it would have been out of tune and out of time his patient devotion and watchfulness came into play and made him an admirable nurse
then margaret was almost touched into tears by the allusions which he often made to their childish days in the new forest he had never forgotten heror helstone eitherall the time he had been roaming among distant countries and foreign people
she might talk to him of the old spot and never feared tiring him
she had been afraid of him before he came even while she had longed for his coming seven or eight years had she felt produced such great changes in herself that forgetting how much of the original margaret was left she had reasoned that if her tastes and feelings had so materially altered even in her stayathome life his wild career with which she was but imperfectly acquainted must have almost substituted another frederick for the tall stripling in his middys uniform whom she remembered looking up to with such admiring awe
but in their absence they had grown nearer to each other in age as well as in many other things
and so it was that the weight this sorrowful time was lightened to margaret
other light than that of fredericks presence she had none
for a few hours the mother rallied on seeing her son
she sate with his hand in hers she would not part with it even while she slept and margaret had to feed him like a baby rather than he should disturb her mother by removing a finger
mrs hale wakened while they were thus engaged she slowly moved her head round on the pillow and smiled at her children as she understood what they were doing and why it was done
i am very selfish said she but it will not be for long frederick bent down and kissed the feeble hand that imprisoned his
this state of tranquility could not endure for many days nor perhaps for many hours so dr donaldson assured margaret
after the kind doctor had gone away she stole down to frederick who during the visit had been adjured to remain quietly concealed in the back parlour usually dixons bedroom but now given up to him
margaret told him what dr donaldson said
i dont believe it he exclaimed
she is very ill she may be dangerously ill and in immediate danger too but i cant imagine that she could be as she is if she were on the point of death
margaret
she should have some other advicesome london doctor
have you never thought of that  yes said margaret more than once
but i dont believe it would do any good
and you know we have not the money to bring any great london surgeon down and i am sure dr donaldson is only second in skill to the very bestif indeed he is to them  frederick began to walk up and down the room impatiently
i have credit in cadiz said he but none here owing to this wretched change of name
why did my father leave helstone
that was the blunder  it was no blunder said margaret gloomily
and above all possible chances avoid letting papa hear anything like what you have just been saying
i can see that he is tormenting himself already with the idea that mamma would never have been ill if we had stayed at helstone and you dont know papas agonising power of selfreproach  frederick walked away as if he were on the quarterdeck
at last he stopped right opposite to margaret and looked at her drooping and desponding attitude for an instant
my little margaret said he caressing her
let us hope as long as we can
poor little woman
what
is this face all wet with tears
i will hope
i will in spite of a thousand doctors
bear up margaret and be brave enough to hope  margaret choked in trying to speak and when she did it was very low
i must try to be meek enough to trust
oh frederick
mamma was getting to love me so
and i was getting to understand her
and now comes death to snap us asunder  come come come
let us go upstairs and do something rather than waste time that may be so precious
thinking has many a time made me sad darling but doing never did in all my life
my theory is a sort of parody on the maxim of get money my son honestly if you can but get money my precept is do something my sister do good if you can but at any rate do something  not excluding mischief said margaret smiling faintly through her tears
by no means
what i do exclude is the remorse afterwards
blot your misdeeds out if you are particularly conscientious by a good deed as soon as you can just as we did a correct sum at school on the slate where an incorrect one was only half rubbed out
it was better than wetting our sponge with our tears both less loss of time where tears had to be waited for and a better effect at last  if margaret thought fredericks theory rather a rough one at first she saw how he worked it out into continual production of kindness in fact
after a bad night with his mother for he insisted on taking his turn as a sitterup he was busy next morning before breakfast contriving a legrest for dixon who was beginning to feel the fatigues of watching
at breakfasttime he interested mr hale with vivid graphic rattling accounts of the wild life he had led in mexico south america and elsewhere
margaret would have given up the effort in despair to rouse mr hale out of his dejection it would even have affected herself and rendered her incapable of talking at all
but fred true to his theory did something perpetually and talking was the only thing to be done besides eating at breakfast
before the night of that day dr donaldsons opinion was proved to be too well founded
convulsions came on and when they ceased mrs hale was unconscious
her husband might lie by her shaking the bed with his sobs her sons strong arms might lift her tenderly up into a comfortable position her daughters hands might bathe her face but she knew them not
she would never recognise them again till they met in heaven
before the morning came all was over
then margaret rose from her trembling and despondency and became as a strong angel of comfort to her father and brother
for frederick had broken down now and all his theories were of no use to him
he cried so violently when shut up in his little room at night that margaret and dixon came down in affright to warn him to be quiet for the house partitions were but thin and the next door neighbours might easily hear his youthful passionate sobs so different from the slower trembling agony of afterlife when we become inured to grief and dare not be rebellious against the inexorable doom knowing who it is that decrees
margaret sate with her father in the room of the dead
if he had cried she would have been thankful
but he sate by the bed quite quietly only from time to time he uncovered the face and stroked it gently making a kind of soft inarticulate noise like that of some motheranimal caressing her young
he took no notice of margarets presence
once or twice she came up to kiss him and he submitted to it giving her a little push away when she had done as if her affection disturbed him from his absorption in the dead
he started when he heard fredericks cries and shook his headpoor boy
poor boy he said and then took no more notice
margarets heart ached within her
she could not think of her own loss in thinking of her fathers case
the night was wearing away and the day was at hand when without a word of preparation margarets voice broke upon the stillness of the room with a clearness of sound that startled even herself let not your heart be troubled it said and she went steadily on through all that chapter of unspeakable consolation
should auld acquaintance be forgot      show not that manner and these features all      the serpents cunning and the sinners fall                           crabbe
the chill shivery october morning came not the october morning of the country with soft silvery mists clearing off before the sunbeams that bring out all the gorgeous beauty of colouring but the october morning of milton whose silvery mists were heavy fogs and where the sun could only show long dusky streets when he did break through and shine
margaret went languidly about assisting dixon in her task of arranging the house
her eyes were continually blinded by tears but she had no time to give way to regular crying
the father and brother depended upon her while they were giving way to grief she must be working planning considering
even the necessary arrangements for the funeral seemed to devolve upon her
when the fire was bright and cracklingwhen everything was ready for breakfast and the teakettle was singing away margaret gave a last look round the room before going to summon mr hale and frederick
she wanted everything to look as cheerful as possible and yet when it did so the contrast between it and her own thoughts forced her into sudden weeping
she was kneeling by the sofa hiding her face in the cushions that no one might hear her cry when she was touched on the shoulder by dixon
come miss halecome my dear
you must not give way or where shall we all be
there is not another person in the house fit to give a direction of any kind and there is so much to be done
theres whos to manage the funeral and whos to come to it and where its to be and all to be settled and master fredericks like one crazed with crying and master never was a good one for settling and poor gentleman he goes about now as if he was lost
its bad enough my dear i know but death comes to us all and youre well off never to have lost any friend till now  perhaps so
but this seemed a loss by itself not to bear comparison with any other event in the world
margaret did not take any comfort from what dixon said but the unusual tenderness of the prim old servants manner touched her to the heart and more from a desire to show her gratitude for this than for any other reason she roused herself up and smiled in answer to dixons anxious look at her and went to tell her father and brother that breakfast was ready
mr hale cameas if in a dream or rather with the unconscious motion of a sleepwalker whose eyes and mind perceive other things than what are present
frederick came briskly in with a forced cheerfulness grasped her hand looked into her eyes and burst into tears
she had to try and think of little nothings to say all breakfasttime in order to prevent the recurrence of her companions thoughts too strongly to the last meal they had taken together when there had been a continual strained listening for some sound or signal from the sickroom
after breakfast she resolved to speak to her father about the funeral
he shook his head and assented to all she proposed though many of her propositions absolutely contradicted one another
margaret gained no real decision from him and was leaving the room languidly to have a consultation with dixon when mr hale motioned her back to his side
ask mr bell said he in a hollow voice
mr
bell said she a little surprised
mr
bell of oxford  mr
bell he repeated
yes
he was my groomsman  margaret understood the association
i will write today said she
he sank again into listlessness
all morning she toiled on longing for rest but in a continual whirl of melancholy business
towards evening dixon said to her  ive done it miss
i was really afraid for master that hed have a stroke with grief
hes been all this day with poor missus and when ive listened at the door ive heard him talking to her and talking to her as if she was alive
when i went in he would be quite quiet but all in a maze like
so i thought to myself he ought to be roused and if it gives him a shock at first it will maybe be the better for him afterwards
so ive been and told him that i dont think its safe for master frederick to be here
and i dont
it was only on tuesday when i was out that i met a southampton manthe first ive seen since i came to milton they dont make their way much up here i think
well it was young leonards old leonards the drapers son as great a scamp as ever livedwho plagued his father almost to death and then ran off to sea
i never could abide him
he was in the orion at the same time as frederick i know though i dont recollect if he was there at the mutiny  did he know you said margaret eagerly
why thats the worst of it
i dont believe he would have known me but for my being such a fool as to call out his name
he were a southampton man in a strange place or else i should never have been so ready to call cousins with him a nasty goodfornothingfellow
says he miss dixon
who would ha thought of seeing you here
but perhaps i mistake and youre miss dixon no longer so i told him he might still address me as an unmarried lady though if i hadnt been so particular id had good chances of matrimony
he was polite enough he couldnt look at me and doubt me but i were not to be caught with such chaff from such a fellow as him and so i told him and by way of being even i asked him after his father who i knew had turned him out of doors as if they were the best friends as ever was
so then to spite mefor you see we were getting savage for all we were so civil to each otherhe began to inquire after master frederick and said what a scrape hed got into as if master fredericks scrapes would ever wash george leonards white or make em look otherwise than nasty dirty black and how hed be hung for mutiny if ever he were caught and how a hundred pound reward had been offered for catching him and what a disgrace he had been to his familyall to spite me you see my dear because before now ive helped old mr leonards to give george a good rating down in southampton
so i said there were other families as i knew who had far more cause to blush for their sons and to be thankful if they could think they were earning an honest living far away from home
to which he made answer like the impudent chap he is that he were in a confidential situation and if i knew of any young man who had been so unfortunate as to lead vicious courses and wanted to turn steady hed have no objection to lend him his patronage
he indeed
why hed corrupt a saint
ive not felt so bad myself for years as when i were standing talking to him the other day
i could have cried to think i couldnt spite him better for he kept smiling in my face as if he took all my compliments for earnest and i couldnt see that he minded what i said in the least while i was mad with all his speeches  but you did not tell him anything about usabout frederick  not i said dixon
he had never the grace to ask where i was staying and i shouldnt have told him if he had asked
nor did i ask him what his precious situation was
he was waiting for a bus and just then it drove up and he hailed it
but to plague me to the last he turned back before he got in and said if you can help me to trap lieutenant hale miss dixon well go partners in the reward
i know youd like to be my partner now wouldnt you
dont be shy but say yes and he jumped on the bus and i saw his ugly face leering at me with a wicked smile to think how hed had the last word of plaguing  margaret was made very uncomfortable by this account of dixons
have you told frederick asked she
no said dixon
i were uneasy in my mind at knowing that bad leonards was in town but there was so much else to think about that i did not dwell on it all
but when i saw master sitting so stiff and with his eyes so glazed and sad i thought it might rouse him to have to think of master frederick in hiding he would have to go poor fellow before mr bell came  oh im not afraid of mr bell but i am afraid of this leonards
i must tell frederick
what did leonards look like  a badlooking fellow i can assure you miss
whiskers such as i should be ashamed to wearthey are so red
and for all he said hed got a confidential situation he was dressed in fustian just like a workingman  it was evident that frederick must go
go too when he had so completely vaulted into his place in the family and promised to be such a stay and staff to his father and sister
go when his cares for the living mother and sorrow for the dead seemed to make him one of those peculiar people who are bound to us by a fellowlove for them that are taken away
just as margaret was thinking all this sitting over the drawingroom fireher father restless and uneasy under the pressure of this newlyaroused fear of which he had not as yet spokenfrederick came in his brightness dimmed but the extreme violence of his grief passed away
he came up to margaret and kissed her forehead
how wan you look margaret said he in a low voice
you have been thinking of everybody and no one has thought of you
lie on this sofathere is nothing for you to do  that is the worst said margaret in a sad whisper
but she went and lay down and her brother covered her feet with a shawl and then sate on the ground by her side and the two began to talk together in a subdued tone
margaret told him all that dixon had related of her interview with young leonards
fredericks lips closed with a long whew of dismay
i should just like to have it out with that young fellow
a worse sailor was never on board shipnor a much worse man either
i declare margaretyou know the circumstances of the whole affair  yes mamma told me  well when all the sailors who were good for anything were indignant with our captain this fellow to curry favourpah
and to think of his being here
oh if hed a notion i was within twenty miles of him hed ferret me out to pay all old grudges
id rather anybody had the hundred pounds they think i am worth than that rascal
what a pity poor old dixon could not be persuaded to give me up and make a provision for her old age  oh frederick hush
dont talk so  mr hale came towards them eager and trembling
he had overheard what they were saying
he took fredericks hand in both of his  my boy you must go
it is very badbut i see you must
you have done all you couldyou have been a comfort to her  oh papa must he go said margaret pleading against her own conviction of necessity
i declare ive a good mind to face it out and stand my trial
if i could only pick up my evidence
i cannot endure the thought of being in the power of such a blackguard as leonards
i could almost have enjoyedin other circumstancesthis stolen visit it has had all the charm which the frenchwoman attributed to forbidden pleasures  one of the earliest things i can remember said margaret was your being in some great disgrace fred for stealing apples
we had plenty of our owntrees loaded with them but some one had told you that stolen fruit tasted sweetest which you took au pied de la lettre and off you went arobbing
you have not changed your feelings much since then  yesyou must go repeated mr hale answering margarets question which she had asked some time ago
his thoughts were fixed on one subject and it was an effort to him to follow the zigzag remarks of his childrenan effort which he did not make
margaret and frederick looked at each other
that quick momentary sympathy would be theirs no longer if he went away
so much was understood through eyes that could not be put into words
both coursed the same thought till it was lost in sadness
frederick shook it off first  do you know margaret i was very nearly giving both dixon and myself a good fright this afternoon
i was in my bedroom i had heard a ring at the front door but i thought the ringer must have done his business and gone away long ago so i was on the point of making my appearance in the passage when as i opened my room door i saw dixon coming downstairs and she frowned and kicked me into hiding again
i kept the door open and heard a message given to some man that was in my fathers study and that then went away
what could it have been
some of the shopmen  very likely said margaret indifferently
there was a little quiet man who came up for orders about two oclock  but this was not a little mana great powerful fellow and it was past four when he was here  it was mr thornton said mr hale
they were glad to have drawn him into the conversation
mr
thornton said margaret a little surprised
i thought  well little one what did you think asked frederick as she did not finish her sentence
oh only said she reddening and looking straight at him i fancied you meant some one of a different class not a gentleman somebody come on an errand  he looked like someone of that kind said frederick carelessly
i took him for a shopman and he turns out a manufacturer  margaret was silent
she remembered how at first before she knew his character she had spoken and thought of him just as frederick was doing
it was but a natural impression that was made upon him and yet she was a little annoyed by it
she was unwilling to speak she wanted to make frederick understand what kind of person mr thornton wasbut she was tonguetied
mr hale went on
he came to offer any assistance in his power i believe
but i could not see him
i told dixon to ask him if he would like to see youi think i asked her to find you and you would go to him
i dont know what i said  he has been a very agreeable acquaintance has he not asked frederick throwing the question like a ball for any one to catch who chose
a very kind friend said margaret when her father did not answer
frederick was silent for a time
at last he spoke  margaret it is painful to think i can never thank those who have shown you kindness
your acquaintances and mine must be separate
unless indeed i run the chances of a courtmartial or unless you and my father would come to spain he threw out this last suggestion as a kind of feeler and then suddenly made the plunge
you dont know how i wish you would
i have a good positionthe chance of a better continued he reddening like a girl
that dolores barbour that i was telling you of margareti only wish you knew her i am sure you would likeno love is the right word like is so pooryou would love her father if you knew her
she is not eighteen but if she is in the same mind another year she is to be my wife
mr barbour wont let us call it an engagement
but if you would come you would find friends everywhere besides dolores
think of it father
margaret be on my side  nono more removals for me said mr hale
one has cost me my wife
no more removals in this life
she will be here and here will i stay out my appointed time  oh frederick said margaret tell us more about her
i never thought of this but i am so glad
you will have some one to love and care for you out there
tell us all about it  in the first place she is a roman catholic
thats the only objection i anticipated
but my fathers change of opinionnay margaret dont sigh  margaret had reason to sigh a little more before the conversation ended
frederick himself was roman catholic in fact though not in profession as yet
this was then the reason why his sympathy in her extreme distress at her fathers leaving the church had been so faintly expressed in his letters
she had thought it was the carelessness of a sailor but the truth was that even then he was himself inclined to give up the form of religion into which had been baptized only that his opinions were tending in exactly the opposite direction to those of his father
how much love had to do with this change not even frederick himself could have told
margaret gave up talking about this branch of the subject at last and returning to the fact of the engagement she began to consider it in some fresh light
but for her sake fred you surely will try and clear yourself of the exaggerated charges brought against you even if the charge of mutiny itself be true
if there were to be a courtmartial and you could find your witnesses you might at any rate show your disobedience to authority was because that authority was unworthily exercised  mr hale roused himself up to listen to his sons answer
in the first place margaret who is to hunt up my witnesses
all of them are sailors drafted off to other ships except those whose evidence would go for very little as they took part or sympathised in the affair
in the next place allow me to tell you you dont know what a courtmartial is and consider it as an assembly where justice is administered instead of what it really isa court where authority weighs ninetenths in the balance and evidence forms only the other tenth
in such cases evidence itself can hardly escape being influenced by the prestige of authority  but is it not worth trying to see how much evidence might be discovered and arrayed on your behalf
at present all those who knew you formerly believe you guilty without any shadow of excuse
you have never tried to justify yourself and we have never known where to seek for proofs of your justification
now for miss barbours sake make your conduct as clear as you can in the eye of the world
she may not care for it she has i am sure that trust in you that we all have but you ought not to let her ally herself to one under such a serious charge without showing the world exactly how it is you stand
you disobeyed authoritythat was bad but to have stood by without word or act while the authority was brutally used would have been infinitely worse
people know what you did but not the motives that elevate it out of a crime into an heroic protection of the weak
for dolores sake they ought to know  but how must i make them know
i am not sufficiently sure of the purity and justice of those who would be my judges to give myself up to a courtmartial even if i could bring a whole array of truthspeaking witnesses
i cant send a bellman about to cry aloud and proclaim in the streets what you are pleased to call my heroism
no one would read a pamphlet of selfjustification so long after the deed even if i put one out  will you consult a lawyer as to your chances of exculpation asked margaret looking up and turning very red
i must first catch my lawyer and have a look at him and see how i like him before i make him into my confidant
many a briefless barrister might twist his conscience into thinking that he could earn a hundred pounds very easily by doing a good actionin giving me a criminal up to justice  nonsense frederickbecause i know a lawyer on whose honour i can rely of whose cleverness in his profession people speak very highly and who would i think take a good deal of trouble for any ofaunt shaws relations
mr henry lennox papa  i think it is a good idea said mr hale
but dont propose anything which will detain frederick in england
dont for your mothers sake  you could go to london by a nighttrain continued margaret warming up into her plan
he must go tomorrow im afraid papa said she tenderly we fixed that because of mr bell and dixons disagreeable acquaintance  yes i must go tomorrow said frederick decidedly
mr hale groaned
i cant bear to part with you and yet i am miserable with anxiety as long as you stop here  well then said margaret listen to my plan
he gets to london on friday morning
i willyou mightno
it would be better to give him a note to mr lennox
you will find him at his chambers in the temple  i will write down a list of all the names i can remember on board the orion
i could leave it with him to ferret them out
he is ediths husbands brother isnt he
i remember your naming him in your letters
i have money in barbours hands
i can pay a pretty long bill if theres any chance of success
money dear father that i had meant for a different purpose so i shall only consider it as borrowed from you and margaret  dont do that said margaret
you wont risk it if you do
and it will be as risk only it is worth trying
you can sail from london as well as from liverpool  to be sure little goose
wherever i feel water heaving under a plank there i feel at home
ill pick up some craft or other to take me off never fear
i wont stay twentyfour hours in london away from you on the one hand and from somebody else on the other  it was rather a comfort to margaret that frederick took it into his head to look over her shoulder as she wrote to mr lennox
if she had not been thus compelled to write steadily and concisely on she might have hesitated over many a word and been puzzled to choose between many an expression in the awkwardness of being the first to resume the intercourse of which the concluding event had been so unpleasant to both sides
however the note was taken from her before she had even had time to look it over and treasured up in a pocketbook out of which fell a long lock of black hair the sight of which caused fredericks eyes to glow with pleasure
now you would like to see that wouldnt you said he
no
you must wait till you see her herself
she is too perfect to be known by fragments
no mean brick shall be a specimen of the building of my palace      mischances
what
remain to be
denounceddragged it may be in chains               werner
all the next day they sate togetherthey three
mr hale hardly ever spoke but when his children asked him questions and forced him as it were into the present
fredericks grief was no more to be seen or heard the first paroxysm had passed over and now he was ashamed of having been so battered down by emotion and though his sorrow for the loss of his mother was a deep real feeling and would last out his life it was never to be spoken of again
margaret not so passionate at first was more suffering now
at times she cried a good deal and her manner even when speaking on different things had a mournful tenderness about it which was deepened whenever her looks fell upon frederick and she thought of his rapidly approaching departure
she was glad he was going on her fathers account however much she might grieve over it on her own
the anxious terror in which mr hale lived lest his son should be detected and captured far outweighed the pleasure he derived from his presence
the nervousness had increased since mrs hales death probably because he dwelt upon it more exclusively
he started at every unusual sound and was never comfortable unless frederick sate out of the immediate view of any one entering the room
towards evening he said  you will go with frederick to the station margaret
i shall want to know he is safely off
you will bring me word that he is clear of milton at any rate  certainly said margaret
i shall like it if you wont be lonely without me papa  no no
i should always be fancying some one had known him and that he had been stopped unless you could tell me you had seen him off
and go to the outwood station
it is quite as near and not so many people about
take a cab there
there is less risk of his being seen
what time is your train fred  ten minutes past six very nearly dark
so what will you do margaret  oh i can manage
i am getting very brave and very hard
it is a welllighted road all the way home if it should be dark
but i was out last week much later  margaret was thankful when the parting was overthe parting from the dead mother and the living father
she hurried frederick into the cab in order to shorten a scene which she saw was so bitterly painful to her father who would accompany his son as he took his last look at his mother
partly in consequence of this and partly owing to one of the very common mistakes in the railway guide as to the times when trains arrive at the smaller stations they found on reaching outwood that they had nearly twenty minutes to spare
the bookingoffice was not open so they could not even take the ticket
they accordingly went down the flight of steps that led to the level of the ground below the railway
there was a broad cinderpath diagonally crossing a field which lay alongside of the carriageroad and they went there to walk backwards and forwards for the few minutes they had to spare
margarets hand lay in fredericks arm
he took hold of it affectionately
margaret
i am going to consult mr lennox as to the chance of exculpating myself so that i may return to england whenever i choose more for your sake than for the sake of anyone else
i cant bear to think of your lonely position if any thing should happen to my father
he looks sadly changedterribly shaken
i wish you could get him to think of the cadiz plan for many reasons
what could you do if he were taken away
you have no friend near
we are curiously bare of relations  margaret could hardly keep from crying at the tender anxiety with which frederick was bringing before her an event which she herself felt was not very improbable so severely had the cares of the last few months told upon mr hale
but she tried to rally as she said  there have been such strange unexpected changes in my life during these last two years that i feel more than ever that it is not worth while to calculate too closely what i should do if any future event took place
i try to think only upon the present she paused they were standing still for a moment close on the field side of the stile leading into the road the setting sun fell on their faces
frederick held her hand in his and looked with wistful anxiety into her face reading there more care and trouble than she would betray by words
she went on  we shall write often to one another and i will promisefor i see it will set your mind at easeto tell you every worry i have
papa isshe started a little a hardly visible startbut frederick felt the sudden motion of the hand he held and turned his full face to the road along which a horseman was slowly riding just passing the very stile where they stood
margaret bowed her bow was stiffly returned
who is that said frederick almost before he was out of hearing
margaret was a little drooping a little flushed as she replied mr
thornton you saw him before you know  only his back
he is an unprepossessinglooking fellow
what a scowl he has  something has happened to vex him said margaret apologetically
you would not have thought him unprepossessing if you had seen him with mamma  i fancy it must be time to go and take my ticket
if i had known how dark it would be we wouldnt have sent back the cab margaret  oh dont fidget about that
i can take a cab here if i like or go back by the railroad when i should have shops and people and lamps all the way from the milton stationhouse
dont think of me take care of yourself
i am sick with the thought that leonards may be in the same train with you
look well into the carriage before you get in  they went back to the station
margaret insisted on going into the full light of the flaring gas inside to take the ticket
some idlelooking young men were lounging about with the stationmaster
margaret thought she had seen the face of one of them before and returned him a proud look of offended dignity for his somewhat impertinent stare of undisguised admiration
she went hastily to her brother who was standing outside and took hold of his arm
have you got your bag
let us walk about here on the platform said she a little flurried at the idea of so soon being left alone and her bravery oozing out rather faster than she liked to acknowledge even to herself
she heard a step following them along the flags it stopped when they stopped looking out along the line and hearing the whizz of the coming train
they did not speak their hearts were too full
another moment and the train would be here a minute more and he would be gone
margaret almost repented the urgency with which she had entreated him to go to london it was throwing more chances of detection in his way
if he had sailed for spain by liverpool he might have been off in two or three hours
frederick turned round right facing the lamp where the gas darted up in vivid anticipation of the train
a man in the dress of a railway porter started forward a badlooking man who seemed to have drunk himself into a state of brutality although his senses were in perfect order
by your leave miss said he pushing margaret rudely on one side and seizing frederick by the collar
your name is hale i believe  in an instant how margaret did not see for everything danced before her eyesbut by some sleight of wrestling frederick had tripped him up and he fell from the height of three or four feet which the platform was elevated above the space of soft ground by the side of the railroad
there he lay
run run gasped margaret
the train is here
it was leonards was it
oh run
i will carry your bag and she took him by the arm to push him along with all her feeble force
a door was opened in a carriagehe jumped in and as he leant out to say god bless you margaret the train rushed past her and she was left standing alone
she was so terribly sick and faint that she was thankful to be able to turn into the ladies waitingroom and sit down for an instant
at first she could do nothing but gasp for breath
it was such a hurry such a sickening alarm such a near chance
if the train had not been there at the moment the man would have jumped up again and called for assistance to arrest him
she wondered if the man had got up she tried to remember if she had seen him move she wondered if he could have been seriously hurt
she ventured out the platform was all alight but still quite deserted she went to the end and looked over somewhat fearfully
no one was there and then she was glad she had made herself go and inspect for otherwise terrible thoughts would have haunted her dreams
and even as it was she was so trembling and affrighted that she felt she could not walk home along the road which did indeed seem lonely and dark as she gazed down upon it from the blaze of the station
she would wait till the down train passed and take her seat in it
but what if leonards recognized her as fredericks companion
she peered about before venturing into the bookingoffice to take her ticket
there were only some railway officials standing about and talking loud to one another
so leonards has been drinking again said one seemingly in authority
hell need all his boasted influence to keep his place this time  where is he asked another while margaret her back towards them was counting her change with trembling fingers not daring to turn round until she heard the answer to this question
i dont know
he came in not five minutes ago with some long story or other about a fall hed had swearing awfully and wanted to borrow some money from me to go to london by the next uptrain
he made all sorts of tipsy promises but id something else to do than listen to him i told him to go about his business and he went off at the front door  hes at the nearest vaults ill be bound said the first speaker
your money would have gone there too if youd been such a fool as to lend it  catch me
i knew better what his london meant
why he has never paid me off that five shillingsand so they went on
and now all margarets anxiety was for the train to come
she hid herself once more in the ladies waitingroom and fancied every noise was leonards stepevery loud and boisterous voice was his
but no one came near her until the train drew up when she was civilly helped into a carriage by a porter into whose face she durst not look till they were in motion and then she saw that it was not leonards
peace
sleep on my love in thy cold bed      never to be disquieted
my last good nightthou wilt not wake      till i thy fate shall overtake                     dr king
home seemed unnaturally quiet after all this terror and noisy commotion
her father had seen all due preparation made for her refreshment on her return and then sate down again in his accustomed chair to fall into one of his sad waking dreams
dixon had got mary higgins to scold and direct in the kitchen and her scolding was not the less energetic because it was delivered in an angry whisper for speaking above her breath she would have thought irreverent as long as there was any one lying dead in the house
margaret had resolved not to mention the crowning and closing affright to her father
there was no use in speaking about it it had ended well the only thing to be feared was lest leonards should in some way borrow money enough to effect his purpose of following frederick to london and hunting him out there
but there were immense chances against the success of any such plan and margaret determined not to torment herself by thinking of what she could do nothing to prevent
frederick would be as much on his guard as she could put him and in a day or two at most he would be safely out of england
i suppose we shall hear from mr bell tomorrow said margaret
yes replied her father
i suppose so  if he can come he will be here tomorrow evening i should think  if he cannot come i shall ask mr thornton to go with me to the funeral
i cannot go alone
i should break down utterly  dont ask mr thornton papa
let me go with you said margaret impetuously
you
my dear women do not generally go  no because they cant control themselves
women of our class dont go because they have no power over their emotions and yet are ashamed of showing them
poor women go and dont care if they are seen overwhelmed with grief
but i promise you papa that if you will let me go i will be no trouble
dont have a stranger and leave me out
dear papa
if mr bell cannot come i shall go
i wont urge my wish against your will if he does  mr bell could not come
he had the gout
it was a most affectionate letter and expressed great and true regret for his inability to attend
he hoped to come and pay them a visit soon if they would have him his milton property required some looking after and his agent had written to him to say that his presence was absolutely necessary or else he had avoided coming near milton as long as he could and now the only thing that would reconcile him to this necessary visit was the idea that he should see and might possibly be able to comfort his old friend
margaret had all the difficulty in the world to persuade her father not to invite mr thornton
she had an indescribable repugnance to this step being taken
the night before the funeral came a stately note from mrs thornton to miss hale saying that at her sons desire their carriage should attend the funeral if it would not be disagreeable to the family
margaret tossed the note to her father
oh dont let us have these forms said she
let us go aloneyou and me papa
they dont care for us or else he would have offered to go himself and not have proposed this sending an empty carriage  i thought you were so extremely averse to his going margaret said mr hale in some surprise
and so i am
i dont want him to come at all and i should especially dislike the idea of our asking him
but this seems such a mockery of mourning that i did not expect it from him she startled her father by bursting into tears
she had been so subdued in her grief so thoughtful for others so gentle and patient in all things that he could not understand her impatient ways tonight she seemed agitated and restless and at all the tenderness which her father in his turn now lavished upon her she only cried the more
she passed so bad a night that she was ill prepared for the additional anxiety caused by a letter received from frederick
mr lennox was out of town his clerk said that he would return by the following tuesday at the latest that he might possibly be home on monday
consequently after some consideration frederick had determined upon remaining in london a day or two longer
he had thought of coming down to milton again the temptation had been very strong but the idea of mr bell domesticated in his fathers house and the alarm he had received at the last moment at the railway station had made him resolve to stay in london
margaret might be assured he would take every precaution against being tracked by leonards
margaret was thankful that she received this letter while her father was absent in her mothers room
if he had been present he would have expected her to read it aloud to him and it would have raised in him a state of nervous alarm which she would have found it impossible to soothe away
there was not merely the fact which disturbed her excessively of fredericks detention in london but there were allusions to the recognition at the last moment at milton and the possibility of a pursuit which made her blood run cold and how then would it have affected her father
many a time did margaret repent of having suggested and urged on the plan of consulting mr lennox
at the moment it had seemed as if it would occasion so little delayadd so little to the apparently small chances of detection and yet everything that had since occurred had tended to make it so undesirable
margaret battled hard against this regret of hers for what could not now be helped this selfreproach for having said what at the time appeared to be wise but which after events were proving to have been so foolish
but her father was in too depressed a state of mind and body to struggle healthily he would succumb to all these causes for morbid regret over what could not be recalled
margaret summoned up all her forces to her aid
her father seemed to have forgotten that they had any reason to expect a letter from frederick that morning
he was absorbed in one ideathat the last visible token of the presence of his wife was to be carried away from him and hidden from his sight
he trembled pitifully as the undertakers man was arranging his crape draperies around him
he looked wistfully at margaret and when released he tottered towards her murmuring pray for me margaret
i have no strength left in me
i cannot pray
i give her up because i must
i try to bear it indeed i do
i know it is gods will
but i cannot see why she died
pray for me margaret that i may have faith to pray
it is a great strait my child  margaret sat by him in the coach almost supporting him in her arms and repeating all the noble verses of holy comfort or texts expressive of faithful resignation that she could remember
her voice never faltered and she herself gained strength by doing this
her fathers lips moved after her repeating the wellknown texts as her words suggested them it was terrible to see the patient struggling effort to obtain the resignation which he had not strength to take into his heart as part of himself
margarets fortitude nearly gave way as dixon with a slight motion of her hand directed her notice to nicholas higgins and his daughter standing a little aloof but deeply attentive to the ceremonial
nicholas wore his usual fustian clothes but had a bit of black stuff sown round his hata mark of mourning which he had never shown to his daughter bessys memory
but mr hale saw nothing
he went on repeating to himself mechanically as it were all the funeral service as it was read by the officiating clergyman he sighed twice or thrice when all was ended and then putting his hand on margarets arm he mutely entreated to be led away as if he were blind and she his faithful guide
dixon sobbed aloud she covered her face with her handkerchief and was so absorbed in her own grief that she did not perceive that the crowd attracted on such occasions was dispersing till she was spoken to by some one close at hand
it was mr thornton
he had been present all the time standing with bent head behind a group of people so that in fact no one had recognised him
i beg your pardonbut can you tell me how mr hale is
and miss hale too
i should like to know how they both are  of course sir
they are much as is to be expected
master is terribly broke down
miss hale bears up better than likely  mr thornton would rather have heard that she was suffering the natural sorrow
in the first place there was selfishness enough in him to have taken pleasure in the idea that his great love might come in to comfort and console her much the same kind of passionate pleasure which comes stinging through a mothers heart when her drooping infant nestles close to her and is dependent upon her for everything
but this delicious vision of what might have beenin which in spite of all margarets repulse he would have indulged only a few days agowas miserably disturbed by the recollection of what he had seen near the outwood station
miserably disturbed that is not strong enough
he was haunted by the remembrance of the handsome young man with whom she stood in an attitude of such familiar confidence and the remembrance shot through him like an agony till it made him clench his hands tight in order to subdue the pain
at that late hour so far from home
it took a great moral effort to galvanise his trusterewhile so perfectin margarets pure and exquisite maidenliness into life as soon as the effort ceased his trust dropped down dead and powerless and all sorts of wild fancies chased each other like dreams through his mind
here was a little bit of miserable gnawing confirmation
she bore up better than likely under this grief
she had then some hope to look to so bright that even in her affectionate nature it could come in to lighten the dark hours of a daughter newly made motherless
yes
he knew how she would love
he had not loved her without gaining that instinctive knowledge of what capabilities were in her
her soul would walk in glorious sunlight if any man was worthy by his power of loving to win back her love
even in her mourning she would rest with a peaceful faith upon his sympathy
his sympathy
whose
that other mans
and that it was another was enough to make mr thorntons pale grave face grow doubly wan and stern at dixons answer
i suppose i may call said he coldly
on mr hale i mean
he will perhaps admit me after tomorrow or so  he spoke as if the answer were a matter of indifference to him
but it was not so
for all his pain he longed to see the author of it
although he hated margaret at times when he thought of that gentle familiar attitude and all the attendant circumstances he had a restless desire to renew her picture in his minda longing for the very atmosphere she breathed
he was in the charybdis of passion and must perforce circle and circle ever nearer round the fatal centre
i dare say sir master will see you
he was very sorry to have to deny you the other day but circumstances was not agreeable just then  for some reason or other dixon never named this interview that she had had with mr thornton to margaret
it might have been mere chance but so it was that margaret never heard that he had attended her poor mothers funeral
false and true
truth will fail thee never never
though thy bark be tempestdriven     though each plank be rent and riven     truth will bear thee on for ever               anon
the bearing up better than likely was a terrible strain upon margaret
sometimes she thought she must give way and cry out with pain as the sudden sharp thought came across her even during her apparently cheerful conversations with her father that she had no longer a mother
about frederick too there was great uneasiness
the sunday post intervened and interfered with their london letters and on tuesday margaret was surprised and disheartened to find that there was still no letter
she was quite in the dark as to his plans and her father was miserable at all this uncertainty
it broke in upon his lately acquired habit of sitting still in one easy chair for half a day together
he kept pacing up and down the room then out of it and she heard him upon the landing opening and shutting the bedroom doors without any apparent object
she tried to tranquillise him by reading aloud but it was evident he could not listen for long together
how thankful she was then that she had kept to herself the additional cause for anxiety produced by their encounter with leonards
she was thankful to hear mr thornton announced
his visit would force her fathers thoughts into another channel
he came up straight to her father whose hands he took and wrung without a wordholding them in his for a minute or two during which time his face his eyes his look told of more sympathy than could be put into words
then he turned to margaret
not better than likely did she look
her stately beauty was dimmed with much watching and with many tears
the expression on her countenance was of gentle patient sadnessnay of positive present suffering
he had not meant to greet her otherwise than with his late studied coldness of demeanour but he could not help going up to her as she stood a little aside rendered timid by the uncertainty of his manner of late and saying the few necessary commonplace words in so tender a voice that her eyes filled with tears and she turned away to hide her emotion
she took her work and sate down very quiet and silent
mr thorntons heart beat quick and strong and for the time he utterly forgot the outwood lane
he tried to talk to mr hale andhis presence always a certain kind of pleasure to mr hale as his power and decision made him and his opinions a safe sure portwas unusually agreeable to her father as margaret saw
presently dixon came to the door and said miss hale you are wanted  dixons manner was so flurried that margaret turned sick at heart
something had happened to fred
she had no doubt of that
it was well that her father and mr thornton were so much occupied by their conversation
what is it dixon asked margaret the moment she had shut the drawingroom door
come this way miss said dixon opening the door of what had been mrs hales bedchamber now margarets for her father refused to sleep there again after his wifes death
its nothing miss said dixon choking a little
only a policeinspector
he wants to see you miss
but i dare say its about nothing at all  did he name asked margaret almost inaudibly
no miss he named nothing
he only asked if you lived here and if he could speak to you
martha went to the door and let him in she has shown him into masters study
i went to him myself to try if that would do but noits you miss he wants  margaret did not speak again till her hand was on the lock of the study door
here she turned round and said take care papa does not come down
mr thornton is with him now  the inspector was almost daunted by the haughtiness of her manner as she entered
there was something of indignation expressed in her countenance but so kept down and controlled that it gave her a superb air of disdain
there was no surprise no curiosity
she stood awaiting the opening of his business there
not a question did she ask
i beg your pardon maam but my duty obliges me to ask you a few plain questions
a man has died at the infirmary in consequence of a fall received at outwood station between the hours of five and six on thursday evening the twentysixth instant
at the time this fall did not seem of much consequence but it was rendered fatal the doctors say by the presence of some internal complaint and the mans own habit of drinking  the large dark eyes gazing straight into the inspectors face dilated a little
otherwise there was no motion perceptible to his experienced observation
her lips swelled out into a richer curve than ordinary owing to the enforced tension of the muscles but he did not know what was their usual appearance so as to recognise the unwonted sullen defiance of the firm sweeping lines
she never blenched or trembled
she fixed him with her eye
nowas he paused before going on she said almost as if she would encourage him in telling his talewellgo on  it is supposed that an inquest will have to be held there is some slight evidence to prove that the blow or push or scuffle that caused the fall was provoked by this poor fellows halftipsy impertinence to a young lady walking with the man who pushed the deceased over the edge of the platform
this much was observed by some one on the platform who however thought no more about the matter as the blow seemed of slight consequence
there is also some reason to identify the lady with yourself in which case  i was not there said margaret still keeping her expressionless eyes fixed on his face with the unconscious look of a sleepwalker
the inspector bowed but did not speak
the lady standing before him showed no emotion no fluttering fear no anxiety no desire to end the interview
the information he had received was very vague one of the porters rushing out to be in readiness for the train had seen a scuffle at the other end of the platform between leonards and a gentleman accompanied by a lady but heard no noise and before the train had got to its full speed after starting he had been almost knocked down by the headlong run of the enraged halfintoxicated leonards swearing and cursing awfully
he had not thought any more about it till his evidence was routed out by the inspector who on making some farther inquiry at the railroad station had heard from the stationmaster that a young lady and gentleman had been there about that hourthe lady remarkably handsomeand said by some grocers assistant present at the time to be a miss hale living at crampton whose family dealt at his shop
there was no certainty that the one lady and gentleman were identical with the other pair but there was great probability
leonards himself had gone halfmad with rage and pain to the nearest ginpalace for comfort and his tipsy words had not been attended to by the busy waiters there they however remembered his starting up and cursing himself for not having sooner thought of the electric telegraph for some purpose unknown and they believed that he left with the idea of going there
on his way overcome by pain or drink he had lain down in the road where the police had found him and taken him to the infirmary there he had never recovered sufficient consciousness to give any distinct account of his fall although once or twice he had had glimmerings of sense sufficient to make the authorities send for the nearest magistrate in hopes that he might be able to take down the dying mans deposition of the cause of his death
but when the magistrate had come he was rambling about being at sea and mixing up names of captains and lieutenants in an indistinct manner with those of his fellow porters at the railway and his last words were a curse on the cornish trick which had he said made him a hundred pounds poorer than he ought to have been
the inspector ran all this over in his mindthe vagueness of the evidence to prove that margaret had been at the stationthe unflinching calm denial which she gave to such a supposition
she stood awaiting his next word with a composure that appeared supreme
then madam i have your denial that you were the lady accompanying the gentleman who struck the blow or gave the push which caused the death of this poor man  a quick sharp pain went through margarets brain
oh god
that i knew frederick were safe a deep observer of human countenances might have seen the momentary agony shoot out of her great gloomy eyes like the torture of some creature brought to bay
but the inspector though a very keen was not a very deep observer
he was a little struck notwithstanding by the form of the answer which sounded like a mechanical repetition of her first replynot changed and modified in shape so as to meet his last question
i was not there said she slowly and heavily
and all this time she never closed her eyes or ceased from that glassy dreamlike stare
his quick suspicions were aroused by this dull echo of her former denial
it was as if she had forced herself to one untruth and had been stunned out of all power of varying it
he put up his book of notes in a very deliberate manner
then he looked up she had not moved any more than if she had been some great egyptian statue
i hope you will not think me impertinent when i say that i may have to call on you again
i may have to summon you to appear on the inquest and prove an alibi if my witnesses it was but one who had recognised her persist in deposing to your presence at the unfortunate event he looked at her sharply
she was still perfectly quietno change of colour or darker shadow of guilt on her proud face
he thought to have seen her wince he did not know margaret hale
he was a little abashed by her real composure
it must have been a mistake of identity
he went on  it is very unlikely maam that i shall have to do anything of the kind
i hope you will excuse me for doing what is only my duty although it may appear impertinent  margaret bowed her head as he went towards the door
her lips were stiff and dry
she could not speak even the common words of farewell
but suddenly she walked forwards and opened the study door and preceded him to the door of the house which she threw wide open for his exit
she kept her eyes upon him in the same dull fixed manner until he was fairly out of the house
she shut the door and went halfway into the study then turned back as if moved by some passionate impulse and locked the door inside
then she went into the study pausedtottered forwardpaused againswayed for an instant where she stood and fell prone on the floor in a dead swoon
expiation
theres nought so finely spun     but it cometh to the sun   mr thornton sate on and on
he felt that his company gave pleasure to mr hale and was touched by the halfspoken wishful entreaty that he would remain a little longerthe plaintive dont go yet which his poor friend put forth from time to time
he wondered margaret did not return but it was with no view of seeing her that he lingered
for the hourand in the presence of one who was so thoroughly feeling the nothingness of earthhe was reasonable and selfcontrolled
he was deeply interested in all her father said      of death and of the heavy lull     and of the brain that has grown dull  it was curious how the presence of mr thornton had power over mr hale to make him unlock the secret thoughts which he kept shut up even from margaret
whether it was that her sympathy would be so keen and show itself in so lively a manner that he was afraid of the reaction upon himself or whether it was that to his speculative mind all kinds of doubts presented themselves at such a time pleading and crying aloud to be resolved into certainties and that he knew she would have shrunk from the expression of any such doubtsnay from him himself as capable of conceiving themwhatever was the reason he could unburden himself better to mr thornton than to her of all the thoughts and fancies and fears that had been frostbound in his brain till now
mr thornton said very little but every sentence he uttered added to mr hales reliance and regard for him
was it that he paused in the expression of some remembered agony mr thorntons two or three words would complete the sentence and show how deeply its meaning was entered into
was it a doubta feara wandering uncertainty seeking rest but finding noneso tearblinded were its eyesmr thornton instead of being shocked seemed to have passed through that very stage of thought himself and could suggest where the exact ray of light was to be found which should make the dark places plain
man of action as he was busy in the worlds great battle there was a deeper religion binding him to god in his heart in spite of his strong wilfulness through all his mistakes than mr hale had ever dreamed
they never spoke of such things again as it happened but this one conversation made them peculiar people to each other knit them together in a way which no loose indiscriminate talking about sacred things can ever accomplish
when all are admitted how can there be a holy of holies
and all this while margaret lay as still and white as death on the study floor
she had sunk under her burden
it had been heavy in weight and long carried and she had been very meek and patient till all at once her faith had given way and she had groped in vain for help
there was a pitiful contraction of suffering upon her beautiful brows although there was no other sign of consciousness remaining
the moutha little while ago so sullenly projected in defiancewas relaxed and livid
e par che de la sua labbia si mova     uno spirto soave e pien damore     chi va dicendo a lanima sospira  the first symptom of returning life was a quivering about the lipsa little mute soundless attempt at speech but the eyes were still closed and the quivering sank into stillness
then feebly leaning on her arms for an instant to steady herself margaret gathered herself up and rose
her comb had fallen out of her hair and with an intuitive desire to efface the traces of weakness and bring herself into order again she sought for it although from time to time in the course of the search she had to sit down and recover strength
her head drooped forwardsher hands meekly laid one upon the othershe tried to recall the force of her temptation by endeavouring to remember the details which had thrown her into such deadly fright but she could not
she only understood two factsthat frederick had been in danger of being pursued and detected in london as not only guilty of manslaughter but as the more unpardonable leader of the mutiny and that she had lied to save him
there was one comfort her lie had saved him if only by gaining some additional time
if the inspector came again tomorrow after she had received the letter she longed for to assure her of her brothers safety she would brave shame and stand in her bitter penanceshe the lofty margaretacknowledging before a crowded justiceroom if need were that she had been as a dog and done this thing but if he came before she heard from frederick if he returned as he had half threatened in a few hours why
she would tell that lie again though how the words would come out after all this terrible pause for reflection and selfreproach without betraying her falsehood she did not know she could not tell
but her repetition of it would gain timetime for frederick
she was roused by dixons entrance into the room she had just been letting out mr thornton
he had hardly gone ten steps in the street before a passing omnibus stopped close by him and a man got down and came up to him touching his hat as he did so
it was the policeinspector
mr thornton had obtained for him his first situation in the police and had heard from time to time of the progress of his protg but they had not often met and at first mr thornton did not remember him
my name is watsongeorge watson sir that you got  ah yes
why you are getting on famously i hear  yes sir
i ought to thank you sir
but it is on a little matter of business i made so bold as to speak to you now
i believe you were the magistrate who attended to take down the deposition of a poor man who died in the infirmary last night  yes replied mr thornton
i went and heard some kind of a rambling statement which the clerk said was of no great use
im afraid he was but a drunken fellow though there is no doubt he came to his death by violence at last
one of my mothers servants was engaged to him i believe and she is in great distress today
what about him  why sir his death is oddly mixed up with somebody in the house i saw you coming out of just now it was a mr haless i believe  yes said mr thornton turning sharp round and looking into the inspectors face with sudden interest
what about it  why sir it seems to me that i have got a pretty distinct chain of evidence inculpating a gentleman who was walking with miss hale that night at the outwood station as the man who struck or pushed leonards off the platform and so caused his death
but the young lady denies that she was there at the time  miss hale denies she was there repeated mr thornton in an altered voice
tell me what evening was it
what time  about six oclock on the evening of thursday the twentysixth  they walked on side by side in silence for a minute or two
the inspector was the first to speak
you see sir there is like to be a coroners inquest and ive got a young man who is pretty positiveat least he was at firstsince he has heard of the young ladys denial he says he should not like to swear but still hes pretty positive that he saw miss hale at the station walking about with a gentleman not five minutes before the time when one of the porters saw a scuffle which he set down to some of leonards impudencebut which led to the fall which caused his death
and seeing you come out of the very house sir i thought i might make bold to ask ifyou see its always awkward having to do with cases of disputed identity and one doesnt like to doubt the word of a respectable young woman unless one has strong proof to the contrary  and she denied having been at the station that evening repeated mr thornton in a low brooding tone
yes sir twice over as distinct as could be
i told her i should call again but seeing you just as i was on my way back from questioning the young man who said it was her i thought i would ask your advice both as the magistrate who saw leonards on his deathbed and as the gentleman who got me my berth in the force  you were quite right said mr thornton
dont take any steps till you have seen me again  the young lady will expect me to call from what i said  i only want to delay you an hour
its now three
come to my warehouse at four  very well sir  and they parted company
mr thornton hurried to his warehouse and sternly forbidding his clerks to allow any one to interrupt him he went his way to his own private room and locked the door
then he indulged himself in the torture of thinking it all over and realising every detail
how could he have lulled himself into the unsuspicious calm in which her tearful image had mirrored itself not two hours before till he had weakly pitied her and yearned towards her and forgotten the savage distrustful jealousy with which the sight of herand that unknown to himat such an hourin such a placehad inspired him
how could one so pure have stooped from her decorous and noble manner of bearing
but was it decorouswas it
he hated himself for the idea that forced itself upon him just for an instantno moreand yet while it was present thrilled him with its old potency of attraction towards her image
and then this falsehoodhow terrible must be some dread of shame to be revealedfor after all the provocation given by such a man as leonards was when excited by drinking might in all probability be more than enough to justify any one who came forward to state the circumstances openly and without reserve
how creeping and deadly that fear which could bow down the truthful margaret to falsehood
he could almost pity her
what would be the end of it
she could not have considered all she was entering upon if there was an inquest and the young man came forward
suddenly he started up
there should be no inquest
he would save margaret
he would take the responsibility of preventing the inquest the issue of which from the uncertainty of the medical testimony which he had vaguely heard the night before from the surgeon in attendance could be but doubtful the doctors had discovered an internal disease far advanced and sure to prove fatal they had stated that death might have been accelerated by the fall or by the subsequent drinking and exposure to cold
if he had but known how margaret would have become involved in the affairif he had but foreseen that he would have stained her whiteness by a falsehood he could have saved her by a word for the question of inquest or no inquest had hung trembling in the balance only the night before
miss hale might love anotherwas indifferent and contemptuous to himbut he would yet do her faithful acts of service of which she should never know
he might despise her but the woman whom he had once loved should be kept from shame and shame it would be to pledge herself to a lie in a public court or otherwise to stand and acknowledge her reason for desiring darkness rather than light
very gray and stern did mr thornton look as he passed out through his wondering clerks
he was away about half an hour and scarcely less stern did he look when he returned although his errand had been successful
he wrote two lines on a slip of paper put it in an envelope and sealed it up
this he gave to one of the clerks saying  i appointed watsonhe who was a packer in the warehouse and who went into the policeto call on me at four oclock
i have just met a gentleman from liverpool who wishes to see me before he leaves town
take care to give this note to watson when he calls  the note contained these words  there will be no inquest
medical evidence not sufficient to justify it
take no further steps
i have not seen the coroner but i will take the responsibility  well thought watson it relieves me from an awkward job
none of my witnesses seemed certain of anything except the young woman
she was clear and distinct enough the porter at the railroad had seen a scuffle
or when he found it was likely to bring him in as a witness then it might not have been a scuffle only a little larking and leonards might have jumped off the platform himselfhe would not stick firm to anything
and jennings the grocers shopmanwell he was not quite so bad but i doubt if i could have got him up to an oath after he heard that miss hale flatly denied it
it would have been a troublesome job and no satisfaction
and now i must go and tell them they wont be wanted  he accordingly presented himself again at mr hales that evening
her father and dixon would fain have persuaded margaret to go to bed but they neither of them knew the reason for her low continued refusals to do so
dixon had learnt part of the truthbut only part
margaret would not tell any human being of what she had said and she did not reveal the fatal termination to leonards fall from the platform
so dixons curiosity combined with her allegiance to urge margaret to go to rest which her appearance as she lay on the sofa showed but too clearly that she required
she did not speak except when spoken to she tried to smile back in reply to her fathers anxious looks and words of tender inquiry but instead of a smile the wan lips resolved themselves into a sigh
he was so miserably uneasy that at last she consented to go into her own room and prepare for going to bed
she was indeed inclined to give up the idea that the inspector would call again that night as it was already past nine oclock
she stood by her father holding on to the back of his chair
you will go to bed soon papa wont you
dont sit up alone  what his answer was she did not hear the words were lost in the far smaller sound that magnified itself to her fears and filled her brain
there was a low ring at the doorbell
she kissed her father and glided down stairs with a rapidity of motion of which no one would have thought her capable who had seen her the minute before
she put aside dixon
dont come i will open the door
i know it is himi cani must manage it all myself  as you please miss said dixon testily but in a moment afterwards she added but youre not fit for it
you are more dead than alive  am i said margaret turning round and showing her eyes all aglow with strange fire her cheeks flushed though her lips were baked and livid still
she opened the door to the inspector and preceded him into the study
she placed the candle on the table and snuffed it carefully before she turned round and faced him
you are late said she
well she held her breath for the answer
i am sorry to have given any unnecessary trouble maam for after all theyve given up all thoughts of holding an inquest
i have had other work to do and other people to see or i should have been here before now  then it is ended said margaret
there is to be no further enquiry  i believe ive got mr thorntons note about me said the inspector fumbling in his pocketbook
mr
thorntons said margaret
yes
hes a magistrateah
here it is  she could not see to read itno not although she was close to the candle
the words swam before her
but she held it in her hand and looked at it as if she were intently studying it
im sure maam its a great weight off my mind for the evidence was so uncertain you see that the man had received any blow at all and if any question of identity came in it so complicated the case as i told mr thornton  mr
thornton said margaret again
i met him this morning just as he was coming out of this house and as hes an old friend of mine besides being the magistrate who saw leonards last night i made bold to tell him of my difficulty  margaret sighed deeply
she did not want to hear any more she was afraid alike of what she had heard and of what she might hear
she wished that the man would go
she forced herself to speak
thank you for calling
it is very late
i dare say it is past ten oclock
oh
here is the note she continued suddenly interpreting the meaning of the hand held out to receive it
he was putting it up when she said i think it is a cramped dazzling sort of writing
i could not read it will you just read it to me  he read it aloud to her
thank you
you told mr thornton that i was not there  oh of course maam
im sorry now that i acted upon information which seems to have been so erroneous
at first the young man was so positive and now he says that he doubted all along and hopes that his mistake wont have occasioned you such annoyance as to lose their shop your custom
good night maam  good night she rang the bell for dixon to show him out
as dixon returned up the passage margaret passed her swiftly
it is all right said she without looking at dixon and before the woman could follow her with further questions she had sped upstairs and entered her bedchamber and bolted her door
she threw herself dressed as she was upon her bed
she was too much exhausted to think
halfanhour or more elapsed before the cramped nature of her position and the chilliness supervening upon great fatigue had the power to rouse her numbed faculties
then she began to recall to combine to wonder
the first idea that presented itself to her was that all this sickening alarm on fredericks behalf was over that the strain was past
the next was a wish to remember every word of the inspectors which related to mr thornton
when had he seen him
what had he said
what had mr thornton done
what were the exact words of his note
and until she could recollect even to the placing or omitting an article the very expressions which he had used in the note her mind refused to go on with its progress
but the next conviction she came to was clear enoughmr thornton had seen her close to outwood station on the fatal thursday night and had been told of her denial that she was there
she stood a liar in his eyes
she was a liar
but she had no thought of penitence before god nothing but chaos and night surrounded the one lurid fact that in mr thorntons eyes she was degraded
she cared not to think even to herself of how much of excuse she might plead
that had nothing to do with mr thornton she never dreamed that he or any one else could find cause for suspicion in what was so natural as her accompanying her brother but what was really false and wrong was known to him and he had a right to judge her
oh frederick
frederick she cried what have i not sacrificed for you even when she fell asleep her thoughts were compelled to travel the same circle only with exaggerated and monstrous circumstances of pain
when she awoke a new idea flashed upon her with all the brightness of the morning
mr thornton had learnt her falsehood before he went to the coroner that suggested the thought that he had possibly been influenced so to do with a view of sparing her the repetition of her denial
but she pushed this notion on one side with the sick wilfulness of a child
if it were so she felt no gratitude to him as it only showed her how keenly he must have seen that she was disgraced already before he took such unwonted pains to spare her any further trial of truthfulness which had already failed so signally
she would have gone through the wholeshe would have perjured herself to save frederick ratherfar ratherthan mr thornton should have had the knowledge that prompted him to interfere to save her
what illfate brought him in contact with the inspector
what made him be the very magistrate sent for to receive leonards deposition
what had leonards said
how much of it was intelligible to mr thornton who might already for aught she knew be aware of the old accusation against frederick through their mutual friend mr bell
if so he had striven to save the son who came in defiance of the law to attend his mothers deathbed
and under this idea she could feel gratefulnot yet if ever she should if his interference had been prompted by contempt
oh
had any one just cause to feel contempt for her
mr thornton above all people on whom she had looked down from her imaginary heights till now
she suddenly found herself at his feet and was strangely distressed at her fall
she shrank from following out the premises to their conclusion and so acknowledging to herself how much she valued his respect and good opinion
whenever this idea presented itself to her at the end of a long avenue of thoughts she turned away from following that pathshe would not believe in it
it was later than she fancied for in the agitation of the previous night she had forgotten to wind up her watch and mr hale had given especial orders that she was not to be disturbed by the usual awakening
by and by the door opened cautiously and dixon put her head in
perceiving that margaret was awake she came forwards with a letter
heres something to do you good miss
a letter from master frederick  thank you dixon
how late it is  she spoke very languidly and suffered dixon to lay it on the counterpane before her without putting out a hand to take it
you want your breakfast im sure
i will bring it you in a minute
master has got the tray all ready i know  margaret did not reply she let her go she felt that she must be alone before she could open that letter
she opened it at last
the first thing that caught her eye was the date two days earlier than she received it
he had then written when he had promised and their alarm might have been spared
but she would read the letter and see
it was hasty enough but perfectly satisfactory
he had seen henry lennox who knew enough of the case to shake his head over it in the first instance and tell him he had done a very daring thing in returning to england with such an accusation backed by such powerful influence hanging over him
but when they had come to talk it over mr lennox had acknowledged that there might be some chance of his acquittal if he could but prove his statements by credible witnessesthat in such case it might be worth while to stand his trial otherwise it would be a great risk
he would examinehe would take every pains
it struck me said frederick that your introduction little sister of mine went a long way
is it so
he made so many inquiries i can assure you
he seemed a sharp intelligent fellow and in good practice too to judge from the signs of business and the number of clerks about him
but these may be only lawyers dodges
i have just caught a packet on the point of sailingi am off in five minutes
i may have to come back to england again on this business so keep my visit secret
i shall send my father some rare old sherry such as you cannot buy in englandsuch stuff as ive got in the bottle before me
he needs something of the kindmy dear love to himgod bless him
im sureheres my cab
pswhat an escape that was
take care you dont breathe of my having beennot even to the shaws  margaret turned to the envelope it was marked too late the letter had probably been trusted to some careless waiter who had forgotten to post it
oh
what slight cobwebs of chances stand between us and temptation
frederick had been safe and out of england twenty nay thirty hours ago and it was only about seventeen hours since she had told a falsehood to baffle pursuit which even then would have been vain
how faithless she had been
where now was her proud motto fais ce que dois advienne que pourra if she had but dared to bravely tell the truth as regarded herself defying them to find out what she refused to tell concerning another how light of heart she would now have felt
not humbled before god as having failed in trust towards him not degraded and abased in mr thorntons sight
she caught herself up at this with a miserable tremor here was she classing his low opinion of her alongside with the displeasure of god
how was it that he haunted her imagination so persistently
what could it be
why did she care for what he thought in spite of all her pride in spite of herself
she believed that she could have borne the sense of almighty displeasure because he knew all and could read her penitence and hear her cries for help in time to come
but mr thorntonwhy did she tremble and hide her face in the pillow
what strong feeling had overtaken her at last
she sprang out of bed and prayed long and earnestly
it soothed and comforted her so to open her heart
but as soon as she reviewed her position she found the sting was still there that she was not good enough nor pure enough to be indifferent to the lowered opinion of a fellow creature that the thought of how he must be looking upon her with contempt stood between her and her sense of wrongdoing
she took her letter in to her father as soon as she was drest
there was so slight an allusion to their alarm at the railroad station that mr hale passed over it without paying any attention to it
indeed beyond the mere fact of frederick having sailed undiscovered and unsuspected he did not gather much from the letter at the time he was so uneasy about margarets pallid looks
she seemed continually on the point of weeping
you are sadly overdone margaret
it is no wonder
but you must let me nurse you now  he made her lie down on the sofa and went for a shawl to cover her with
his tenderness released her tears and she cried bitterly
poor childpoor child said he looking fondly at her as she lay with her face to the wall shaking with her sobs
after a while they ceased and she began to wonder whether she durst give herself the relief of telling her father of all her trouble
but there were more reasons against it than for it
the only one for it was the relief to herself and against it was the thought that it would add materially to her fathers nervousness if it were indeed necessary for frederick to come to england again that he would dwell on the circumstance of his sons having caused the death of a man however unwittingly and unwillingly that this knowledge would perpetually recur to trouble him in various shapes of exaggeration and distortion from the simple truth
and about her own great faulthe would be distressed beyond measure at her want of courage and faith yet perpetually troubled to make excuses for her
formerly margaret would have come to him as priest as well as father to tell him of her temptation and her sin but latterly they had not spoken much on such subjects and she knew not how in his change of opinions he would reply if the depth of her soul called unto his
no she would keep her secret and bear the burden alone
alone she would go before god and cry for his absolution
alone she would endure her disgraced position in the opinion of mr thornton
she was unspeakably touched by the tender efforts of her father to think of cheerful subjects on which to talk and so to take her thoughts away from dwelling on all that had happened of late
it was some months since he had been so talkative as he was this day
he would not let her sit up and offended dixon desperately by insisting on waiting upon her himself
at last she smiled a poor weak little smile but it gave him the truest pleasure
it seems strange to think that what gives us most hope for the future should be called dolores said margaret
the remark was more in character with her father than with her usual self but today they seemed to have changed natures
her mother was a spaniard i believe that accounts for her religion
her father was a stiff presbyterian when i knew him
but it is a very soft and pretty name  how young she isyounger by fourteen months than i am
just the age that edith was when she was engaged to captain lennox
papa we will go and see them in spain  he shook his head
but he said if you wish it margaret
only let us come back here
it would seem unfairunkind to your mother who always im afraid disliked milton so much if we left it now she is lying here and cannot go with us
no dear you shall go and see them and bring me back a report of my spanish daughter  no papa i wont go without you
who is to take care of you when i am gone  i should like to know which of us is taking care of the other
but if you went i should persuade mr thornton to let me give him double lessons
we would work up the classics famously
that would be a perpetual interest
you might go on and see edith at corfu if you liked  margaret did not speak all at once
then she said rather gravely thank you papa
but i dont want to go
we will hope that mr lennox will manage so well that frederick may bring dolores to see us when they are married
and as for edith the regiment wont remain much longer in corfu
perhaps we shall see both of them here before another year is out  mr hales cheerful subjects had come to an end
some painful recollections had stolen across his mind and driven him into silence
by and by margaret said  papadid you see nicholas higgins at the funeral
he was there and mary too
poor fellow
it was his way of showing sympathy
he has a good warm heart under his bluff abrupt ways  i am sure of it replied mr hale
i saw it all along even while you tried to persuade me that he was all sorts of bad things
we will go and see them tomorrow if you are strong enough to walk so far  oh yes
i want to see them
we did not pay maryor rather she refused to take it dixon says
we will go so as to catch him just after his dinner and before he goes to his work  towards evening mr hale said  i half expected mr thornton would have called
he spoke of a book yesterday which he had and which i wanted to see
he said he would try and bring it today  margaret sighed
she knew he would not come
he would be too delicate to run the chance of meeting her while her shame must be so fresh in his memory
the very mention of his name renewed her trouble and produced a relapse into the feeling of depressed preoccupied exhaustion
she gave way to listless languor
suddenly it struck her that this was a strange manner to show her patience or to reward her father for his watchful care of her all through the day
she sate up and offered to read aloud
his eyes were failing and he gladly accepted her proposal
she read well she gave the due emphasis but had any one asked her when she had ended the meaning of what she had been reading she could not have told
she was smitten with a feeling of ingratitude to mr thornton inasmuch as in the morning she had refused to accept the kindness he had shown her in making further inquiry from the medical men so as to obviate any inquest being held
oh
she was grateful
she had been cowardly and false and had shown her cowardliness and falsehood in action that could not be recalled but she was not ungrateful
it sent a glow to her heart to know she could feel towards one who had reason to despise her
his cause for contempt was so just that she should have respected him less if she had thought he did not feel contempt
it was a pleasure to feel how thoroughly she respected him
he could not prevent her doing that it was the one comfort in all this misery
late in the evening the expected book arrived with mr thorntons kind regards and wishes to know how mr hale is  say that i am much better dixon but that miss hale  no papa said margaret eagerlydont say anything about me
he does not ask  my dear child how you are shivering said her father a few minutes afterwards
you must go to bed directly
you have turned quite pale  margaret did not refuse to go though she was loth to leave her father alone
she needed the relief of solitude after a day of busy thinking and busier repenting
but she seemed much as usual the next day the lingering gravity and sadness and the occasional absence of mind were not unnatural symptoms in the early days of grief
and almost in proportion to her reestablishment in health was her fathers relapse into his abstracted musings upon the wife he had lost and the past era in his life that was closed to him for ever
union not always strength
the steps of the bearers heavy and slow     the sobs of the mourners deep and low               shelley
at the time arranged the previous day they set out on their walk to see nicholas higgins and his daughter
they both were reminded of their recent loss by a strange kind of shyness in their new habiliments and in the fact that it was the first time for many weeks that they had deliberately gone out together
they drew very close to each other in unspoken sympathy
nicholas was sitting by the fireside in his accustomed corner but he had not his accustomed pipe
he was leaning his head upon his hand his arm resting on his knee
he did not get up when he saw them though margaret could read the welcome in his eye
sit ye down sit ye down
fires welly out said he giving it a vigorous poke as if to turn attention away from himself
he was rather disorderly to be sure with a black unshaven beard of several days growth making his pale face look yet paler and a jacket which would have been all the better for patching
we thought we should have a good chance of finding you just after dinnertime said margaret
we have had our sorrows too since we saw you said mr hale
ay ay
sorrows is more plentiful than dinners just now i reckon my dinner hour stretches all oer the day yore pretty sure of finding me  are you out of work asked margaret
ay he replied shortly
then after a moments silence he added looking up for the first time im not wanting brass
dunno yo think it
bess poor lass had a little stock under her pillow ready to slip into my hand last moment and mary is fustiancutting
but im out of work a the same  we owe mary some money said mr hale before margarets sharp pressure on his arm could arrest the words
if hoo takes it ill turn her out o doors
ill bide inside these four walls and shell bide out
thats a  but we owe her many thanks for her kind service began mr hale again
i neer thanken your daughter theer for her deeds o love to my poor wench
i neer could find th words
ise have to begin to try now if yo start making an ado about what little mary could sarve yo  is it because of the strike youre out of work asked margaret gently
strikes ended
its oer for this time
im out o work because i neer asked for it
and i neer asked for it because good words is scarce and bad words is plentiful  he was in a mood to take a surly pleasure in giving answers that were like riddles
but margaret saw that he would like to be asked for the explanation
and good words are  asking for work
i reckon thems almost the best words that men can say
gi me work means and ill do it like a man thems good words  and bad words are refusing you work when you ask for it  ay
bad words is saying aha my fine chap
yove been true to yor order and ill be true to mine
yo did the best yo could for them as wanted help thats yore way of being true to yore kind and ill be true to mine
yove been a poor fool as knowed no better nor be a true faithful fool
so go and be dd to yo
theres no work for yo here thems bad words
im not a fool and if i was folk ought to ha taught me how to be wise after their fashion
i could mappen ha learnt if any one had tried to teach me  would it not be worth while said mr hale to ask your old master if he would take you back again
it might be a poor chance but it would be a chance  he looked up again with a sharp glance at the questioner and then tittered a low and bitter laugh
measter
if its no offence ill ask yo a question or two in my turn  youre quite welcome said mr hale
i reckon yon some way of earning your bread
folk seldom lives i milton just for pleasure if they can live anywhere else  you are quite right
i have some independent property but my intention in settling in milton was to become a private tutor  to teach folk
well
i reckon they pay yo for teaching them dunnot they  yes replied mr hale smiling
i teach in order to get paid  and them that pays yo dun they tell yo whatten to do or whatten not to do wi the money they gives you in just payment for your painsin fair exchange like  no to be sure not  they dunnot say yo may have a brother or a friend as dear as a brother who wants this here brass for a purpose both yo and he think right but yo mun promise not give it to him
yo may see a good use as yo think to put yor money to but we dont think it good and so if yo spend it athatens well just leave off dealing with yo they dunnot say that dun they  no to be sure not  would yo stand it if they did  it would be some very hard pressure that would make me even think of submitting to such dictation  theres not the pressure on all the broad earth that would make me said nicholas higgins
now yove got it
yove hit the bulls eye
hampersthats where i workedmakes their men pledge emselves theyll not give a penny to help th union or keep turnouts fro clemming
they may pledge and make pledge continued he scornfully they nobbut make liars and hypocrites
and thats a less sin to my mind to make mens hearts so hard that theyll not do a kindness to them as needs it or help on the right and just cause though it goes again the strong hand
but ill neer forswear mysel for a the work the king could gie me
im a member o the union and i think its the only thing to do the workmen any good
and ive been a turnout and known what it was to clem so if i get a shilling sixpence shall go to them if they axe it from me
consequence is i dunnot see where im to get a shilling  is that rule about not contributing to the union in force at all the mills asked margaret
i cannot say
its a new regulation at ours and i reckon theyll find that they cannot stick to it
but its in force now
byandby theyll find out tyrants makes liars  there was a little pause
margaret was hesitating whether she should say what was in her mind she was unwilling to irritate one who was always gloomy and despondent enough
at last out it came
but in her soft tones and with her reluctant manner shewing that she was unwilling to say anything unpleasant it did not seem to annoy higgins only to perplex him
do you remember poor boucher saying that the union was a tyrant
i think he said it was the worse tyrant of all
and i remember at the time i agreed with him  it was a long while before he spoke
he was resting his head on his two hands and looking down into the fire so she could not read the expression on his face
ill not deny but what th union finds it necessary to force a man into his own good
ill speak truth
a man leads a dree life whos not i th union
but once i th union his interests are taken care on better nor he could do it for himsel or by himsel for that matter
its the only way working men can get their rights by all joining together
more the members more chance for each one separate man having justice done him
government takes care o fools and madmen and if any man is inclined to do himsel or his neighbour a hurt it puts a bit of a check on him whether he likes it or no
thats all we do i th union
we cant clap folk into prison but we can make a mans life so heavy to be borne that hes obliged to come in and be wise and helpful in spite of himsel
boucher were a fool all along and neer a worse fool than at th last  he did you harm asked margaret
aye that did he
we had public opinion on our side till he and his sort began rioting and breaking laws
it were all oer wi the strike then  then would it not have been far better to have left him alone and not forced him to join the union
he did you no good and you drove him mad  margaret said her father in a low and warning tone for he saw the cloud gathering on higginss face
i like her said higgins suddenly
hoo speaks plain out whats in her mind
hoo doesnt comprehend th union for all that
its a great power its our only power
i ha read a bit o poetry about a plough going oer a daisy as made tears come into my eyes afore id other cause for crying
but the chap neer stopped driving the plough ise warrant for all he was pitiful about the daisy
hed too much motherwit for that
th unions the plough making ready the land for harvesttime
such as bouchertwould be settin him up too much to liken him to a daisy hes liker a weed lounging over the groundmun just made up their mind to be put out o the way
im sore vexed wi him just now
so mappen i dunnot speak him fair
i could go oer him wi a plough mysel wi a the pleasure in life  why
what has he been doing
anything fresh  ay to be sure
hes neer out o mischief that man
first of a he must go raging like a mad fool and kick up yon riot
then hed to go into hiding where hed a been yet if thornton had followed him out as id hoped he would ha done
but thornton having got his own purpose didnt care to go on wi the prosecution for the riot
so boucher slunk back again to his house
he neer showed himsel abroad for a day or two
he had that grace
and then where think ye that he went
why to hampers
damn him
he went wi his mealymouthed face that turns me sick to look at aasking for work though he knowed well enough the new rule o pledging themselves to give nought to th unions nought to help the starving turnout
why hed a clemmed to death if th union had na helped him in his pinch
there he went ossing to promise aught and pledge himsel to aughtto tell a he knowd on our proceedings the goodfornothing judas
but ill say this for hamper and thank him for it at my dying day he drove boucher away and would na listen to himneer a wordthough folk standing by says the traitor cried like a babby  oh
how shocking
how pitiful exclaimed margaret
higgins i dont know you today
dont you see how youve made boucher what he is by driving him into the union against his willwithout his heart going with it
you have made him what he is  made him what he is
what was he
gathering gathering along the narrow street came a hollow measured sound now forcing itself on their attention
many voices were hushed and low many steps were heard not moving onwards at least not with any rapidity or steadiness of motion but as if circling round one spot
yes there was one distinct slow tramp of feet which made itself a clear path through the air and reached their ears the measured laboured walk of men carrying a heavy burden
they were all drawn towards the housedoor by some irresistible impulse impelled thithernot by a poor curiosity but as if by some solemn blast
six men walked in the middle of the road three of them being policemen
they carried a door taken off its hinges upon their shoulders on which lay some dead human creature and from each side of the door there were constant droppings
all the street turned out to see and seeing to accompany the procession each one questioning the bearers who answered almost reluctantly at last so often had they told the tale
we found him i th brook in the field beyond there  th brookwhy theres not water enough to drown him  he was a determined chap
he lay with his face downwards
he was sick enough o living choose what cause he had for it  higgins crept up to margarets side and said in a weak piping kind of voice its not john boucher
he had na spunk enough
sure
its not john boucher
why they are a looking this way
listen
ive a singing in my head and i cannot hear  they put the door down carefully upon the stones and all might see the poor drowned wretchhis glassy eyes one halfopen staring right upwards to the sky
owing to the position in which he had been found lying his face was swollen and discoloured besides his skin was stained by the water in the brook which had been used for dyeing purposes
the fore part of his head was bald but the hair grew thin and long behind and every separate lock was a conduit for water
through all these disfigurements margaret recognised john boucher
it seemed to her so sacrilegious to be peering into that poor distorted agonised face that by a flash of instinct she went forwards and softly covered the dead mans countenance with her handkerchief
the eyes that saw her do this followed her as she turned away from her pious office and were thus led to the place where nicholas higgins stood like one rooted to the spot
the men spoke together and then one of them came up to higgins who would have fain shrunk back into his house
higgins thou knowed him
thou mun go tell the wife
do it gently man but do it quick for we canna leave him here long  i canna go said higgins
dunnot ask me
i canna face her  thou knows her best said the man
wen done a deal in bringing him herethou take thy share  i canna do it said higgins
im welly felled wi seeing him
we wasnt friends and now hes dead  well if thou wunnot thou wunnot
some one mun though
its a dree task but its a chance every minute as she doesnt hear on it in some rougher way nor a person going to make her let on by degrees as it were  papa do you go said margaret in a low voice
if i couldif i had time to think of what i had better say but all at once margaret saw that her father was indeed unable
he was trembling from head to foot
i will go said she
bless yo miss it will be a kind act for shes been but a sickly sort o body i hear and few hereabouts know much on her  margaret knocked at the closed door but there was such a noise as of many little illordered children that she could hear no reply indeed she doubted if she was heard and as every moment of delay made her recoil from her task more and more she opened the door and went in shutting it after her and even unseen by the woman fastening the bolt
mrs boucher was sitting in a rockingchair on the other side of the illreddup fireplace it looked as if the house had been untouched for days by any effort at cleanliness
margaret said something she hardly knew what her throat and mouth were so dry and the childrens noise completely prevented her from being heard
she tried again
how are you mrs boucher
but very poorly im afraid  ive chance o being well said she querulously
im left alone to manage these childer and nought for to give em for to keep em quiet
john should na ha left me and me so poorly  how long is it since he went away  four days sin
no one would give him work here and hed to go on tramp toward greenfield
but he might ha been back afore this or sent me some word if hed getten work
he might  oh dont blame him said margaret
he felt it deeply im sure  willto hold thy din and let me hear the lady speak addressing herself in no very gentle voice to a little urchin of about a year old
she apologetically continued to margaret hes always mithering me for daddy and butty and i ha no butties to give him and daddys away and forgotten us a i think
hes his fathers darling he is said she with a sudden turn of mood and dragging the child up to her knee she began kissing it fondly
margaret laid her hand on the womans arm to arrest her attention
their eyes met
poor little fellow said margaret slowly he was his fathers darling  he is his fathers darling said the woman rising hastily and standing face to face with margaret
neither of them spoke for a moment or two
then mrs boucher began in a low growling tone gathering in wildness as she went on he is his fathers darling i say
poor folk can love their childer as well as rich
why dunno yo speak
why dun yo stare at me wi your great pitiful eyes
wheres john weak as she was she shook margaret to force out an answer
oh my god said she understanding the meaning of that tearful look
she sank back into the chair
margaret took up the child and put him into her arms
he loved him said she
ay said the woman shaking her head he loved us a
we had some one to love us once
its a long time ago but when he were in life and with us he did love us he did
he loved this babby mappen the best on us but he loved me and i loved him though i was calling him five minutes agone
are yo sure hes dead said she trying to get up
if its only that hes ill and like to die they may bring him round yet
im but an ailing creature myselive been ailing this long time  but he is deadhe is drowned  folk are brought round after theyre deaddrowned
whatten was i thinking of to sit still when i should be stirring mysel
here whisth thee childwhisth thee
tak this tak aught to play wi but dunnot cry while my hearts breaking
oh where is my strength gone to
oh johnhusband  margaret saved her from falling by catching her in her arms
she sate down in the rocking chair and held the woman upon her knees her head lying on margarets shoulder
the other children clustered together in affright began to understand the mystery of the scene but the ideas came slowly for their brains were dull and languid of perception
they set up such a cry of despair as they guessed the truth that margaret knew not how to bear it
johnnys cry was loudest of them all though he knew not why he cried poor little fellow
the mother quivered as she lay in margarets arms
margaret heard a noise at the door
open it
open it quick said she to the eldest child
its bolted make no noisebe very still
oh papa let them go upstairs very softly and carefully and perhaps she will not hear them
she has faintedthats all  its as well for her poor creature said a woman following in the wake of the bearers of the dead
but yore not fit to hold her
stay ill run fetch a pillow and well let her down easy on the floor  this helpful neighbour was a great relief to margaret she was evidently a stranger to the house a newcomer in the district indeed but she was so kind and thoughtful that margaret felt she was no longer needed and that it would be better perhaps to set an example of clearing the house which was filled with idle if sympathising gazers
she looked round for nicholas higgins
he was not there
so she spoke to the woman who had taken the lead in placing mrs boucher on the floor
can you give all these people a hint that they had better leave in quietness
so that when she comes round she could only find one or two that she knows about her
papa will you speak to the men and get them to go away
she cannot breathe poor thing with this crowd about her  margaret was kneeling down by mrs boucher and bathing her face with vinegar but in a few minutes she was surprised at the gush of fresh air
she looked round and saw a smile pass between her father and the woman
what is it asked she
only our good friend here replied her father hit on a capital expedient for clearing the place  i did em begone and each take a child with em and to mind that they were orphans and their mother a widow
it was who could do most and the childer are sure of a bellyful today and of kindness too
does hoo know how he died  no said margaret i could not tell her all at once  hoo mun be told because of th inquest
see
hoos coming round shall you or i do it
or mappen your father would be best  no you you said margaret
they awaited her perfect recovery in silence
then the neighbour woman sat down on the floor and took mrs bouchers head and shoulders on her lap
neighbour said she your man is dead
guess yo how he died  he were drowned said mrs boucher feebly beginning to cry for the first time at this rough probing of her sorrows
he were found drowned
he were coming home very hopeless o aught on earth
he thought god could na be harder than men mappen not so hard mappen as tender as a mother mappen tenderer
im not saying he did right and im not saying he did wrong
all i say is may neither me nor mine ever have his sore heart or we may do like things  he has left me alone wi a these children moaned the widow less distressed at the manner of the death than margaret expected but it was of a piece with her helpless character to feel his loss as principally affecting herself and her children
not alone said mr hale solemnly
who is with you
who will take up your cause the widow opened her eyes wide and looked at the new speaker of whose presence she had not been aware till then
who has promised to be a father to the fatherless continued he
but ive getten six children sir and the eldest not eight years of age
im not meaning for to doubt his power sironly it needs a deal o trust and she began to cry afresh
hooll be better able to talk tomorrow sir said the neighbour
best comfort now would be the feel of a child at her heart
im sorry they took the babby  ill go for it said margaret
and in a few minutes she returned carrying johnnie his face all smeared with eating and his hands loaded with treasures in the shape of shells and bits of crystal and the head of a plaster figure
she placed him on his mothers arms
there said the woman now you go
theyll cry together and comfort together better nor any one but a child can do
ill stop with her as long as im needed and if you come tomorrow you can have a deal o wise talk with her that shes not up to today  as margaret and her father went slowly up the street she paused at higginss closed door
shall we go in asked her father
i was thinking of him too  they knocked
there was no answer so they tried the door
it was bolted but they thought they heard him moving within
nicholas said margaret
there was no answer and they might have gone away believing the house to be empty if there had not been some accidental fall as of a book within
nicholas said margaret again
it is only us
wont you let us come in  no said he
i spoke as plain as i could bout using words when i bolted th door
let me be this day  mr hale would have urged their desire but margaret placed her finger on his lips
i dont wonder at it said she
i myself long to be alone
it seems the only thing to do one good after a day like this      looking south
a spade
a rake
a hoe
a pickaxe or a bill
a hook to reap or a scythe to mow       a flail or what ye will     and heres a ready hand       to ply the needful tool     and skilld enough by lessons rough       in labours rugged school               hood
higginss door was locked the next day when they went to pay their call on the widow boucher but they learnt this time from an officious neighbour that he was really from home
he had however been in to see mrs boucher before starting on his days business whatever that was
it was but an unsatisfactory visit to mrs boucher she considered herself an illused woman by her poor husbands suicide and there was quite germ of truth enough in this idea to make it a very difficult one to refute
still it was unsatisfactory to see how completely her thoughts were turned upon herself and her own position and this selfishness extended even to her relations with her children whom she considered as incumbrances even in the very midst of her somewhat animal affection for them
margaret tried to make acquaintances with one or two of them while her father strove to raise the widows thoughts into some higher channel than that of mere helpless querulousness
she found that the children were truer and simpler mourners than the widow
daddy had been a kind daddy to them each could tell in their eager stammering way of some tenderness shown some indulgence granted by the lost father
is yon thing upstairs really him
it doesna look like him
im feared on it and i never was feared o daddy  margarets heart bled to hear that the mother in her selfish requirement of sympathy had taken her children upstairs to see their dead disfigured father
it was intermingling the coarseness of horror with the profoundness of natural grief
she tried to turn their thoughts in some other direction on what they could do for mother on whatfor this was a more efficacious way of putting itwhat father would have wished them to do
margaret was more successful than mr hale in her efforts
the children seeing their little duties lie in action close around them began to try each one to do something that she suggested towards redding up the slatternly room
but her father set too high a standard and too abstract a view before the indolent invalid
she could not rouse her torpid mind into any vivid imagination of what her husbands misery might have been before he had resorted to the last terrible step she could only look upon it as it affected herself she could not enter into the enduring mercy of the god who had not specially interposed to prevent the water from drowning her prostrate husband and although she was secretly blaming her husband for having fallen into such drear despair and denying that he had any excuse for his last rash act she was inveterate in her abuse of all who could by any possibility be supposed to have driven him to such desperation
the mastersmr thornton in particular whose mill had been attacked by boucher and who after the warrant had been issued for his apprehension on the charge of rioting had caused it to be withdrawnthe union of which higgins was a representative to the poor womanthe children so numerous so hungry and so noisyall made up one great army of personal enemies whose fault it was that she was now a helpless widow
margaret heard enough of this unreasonableness to dishearten her and when they came away she found it impossible to cheer her father
it is the town life said she
their nerves are quickened by the haste and bustle and speed of everything around them to say nothing of the confinement in these pentup houses which of itself is enough to induce depression and worry of spirits
now in the country people live so much more out of doors even children and even in the winter  but people must live in towns
and in the country some get such stagnant habits of mind that they are almost fatalists  yes i acknowledge that
i suppose each mode of life produces its own trials and its own temptations
the dweller in towns must find it as difficult to be patient as the countrybred man must find it to be active and equal to unwonted emergencies
both must find it hard to realise a future of any kind the one because the present is so living and hurrying and close around him the other because his life tempts him to revel in the mere sense of animal existence not knowing of and consequently not caring for any pungency of pleasure for the attainment of which he can plan and deny himself and look forward  and thus both the necessity for engrossment and the stupid content in the present produce the same effects
but this poor mrs boucher
how little we can do for her  and yet we dare not leave her without our efforts although they may seem so useless
oh papa
its a hard world to live in  so it is my child
we feel it so just now at any rate but we have been very happy even in the midst of our sorrow
what a pleasure fredericks visit was  yes that it was said margaret brightly
it was such a charming snatched forbidden thing but she suddenly stopped speaking
she had spoiled the remembrance of fredericks visit to herself by her own cowardice
of all faults the one she most despised in others was the want of bravery the meanness of heart which leads to untruth
and here had she been guilty of it
then came the thought of mr thorntons cognisance of her falsehood
she wondered if she should have minded detection half so much from any one else
she tried herself in imagination with her aunt shaw and edith with her father with captain and mr lennox with frederick
the thought of the last knowing what she had done even in his own behalf was the most painful for the brother and sister were in the first flush of their mutual regard and love but even any fall in fredericks opinion was as nothing to the shame the shrinking shame she felt at the thought of meeting mr thornton again
and yet she longed to see him to get it over to understand where she stood in his opinion
her cheeks burnt as she recollected how proudly she had implied an objection to trade in the early days of their acquaintance because it too often led to the deceit of passing off inferior for superior goods in the one branch of assuming credit for wealth and resources not possessed in the other
she remembered mr thorntons look of calm disdain as in few words he gave her to understand that in the great scheme of commerce all dishonourable ways of acting were sure to prove injurious in the long run and that testing such actions simply according to the poor standard of success there was folly and not wisdom in all such and every kind of deceit in trade as well as in other things
she rememberedshe then strong in her own untempted truthasking him if he did not think that buying in the cheapest and selling in the dearest market proved some want of the transparent justice which is so intimately connected with the idea of truth and she had used the word chivalricand her father had corrected her with the higher word christian and so drawn the argument upon himself while she sate silent by with a slight feeling of contempt
no more contempt for herno more talk about the chivalric
henceforward she must feel humiliated and disgraced in his sight
but when should she see him
her heart leaped up in apprehension at every ring of the doorbell and yet when it fell down to calmness she felt strangely saddened and sick at heart at each disappointment
it was very evident that her father expected to see him and was surprised that he did not come
the truth was that there were points in their conversation the other night on which they had no time then to enlarge but it had been understood that if possible on the succeeding eveningif not then at least the very first evening that mr thornton could commandthey should meet for further discussion
mr hale had looked forward to this meeting ever since they had parted
he had not yet resumed the instruction to his pupils which he had relinquished at the commencement of his wifes more serious illness so he had fewer occupations than usual and the great interest of the last day or so bouchers suicide had driven him back with more eagerness than ever upon his speculations
he was restless all the evening
he kept saying i quite expected to have seen mr thornton
i think the messenger who brought the book last night must have had some note and forgot to deliver it
do you think there has been any message left today  i will go and inquire papa said margaret after the changes on these sentences had been rung once or twice stay theres a ring she sat down instantly and bent her head attentively over her work
she heard a step on the stairs but it was only one and she knew it was dixons
she lifted up her head and sighed and believed she felt glad
its that higgins sir
he wants to see you or else miss hale
or it might be miss hale first and then you sir for hes in a strange kind of way  he had better come up here dixon and then he can see us both and choose which he likes for his listener  oh
very well sir
ive no wish to hear what hes got to say im sure only if you could see his shoes im sure youd say the kitchen was the fitter place  he can wipe them i suppose said mr hale
so dixon flung off to bid him walk upstairs
she was a little mollified however when he looked at his feet with a hesitating air and then sitting down on the bottom stair he took off the offending shoes and without a word walked upstairs
sarvant sir said he slicking his hair down when he came into the room if hool excuse me looking at margaret for being i my stockings ise been tramping a day and streets is none o th cleanest  margaret thought that fatigue might account for the change in his manner for he was unusually quiet and subdued and he had evidently some difficulty in saying what he came to say
mr hales everready sympathy with anything of shyness or hesitation or want of selfpossession made him come to his aid
we shall have tea up directly and then youll take a cup with us mr higgins
i am sure you are tired if youve been out much this wet relaxing day
margaret my dear cant you hasten tea  margaret could only hasten tea by taking the preparation of it into her own hands and so offending dixon who was emerging out of her sorrow for her late mistress into a very touchy irritable state
but martha like all who came in contact with margareteven dixon herself in the long runfelt it a pleasure and an honour to forward any of her wishes and her readiness and margarets sweet forbearance soon made dixon ashamed of herself
why master and you must always be asking the lower classes upstairs since we came to milton i cannot understand
folk at helstone were never brought higher than the kitchen and ive let one or two of them know before now that they might think it an honour to be even there  higgins found it easier to unburden himself to one than to two
after margaret left the room he went to the door and assured himself that it was shut
then he came and stood close to mr hale
master said he yod not guess easy what ive been tramping after today
special if yod remember my manner o talk yesterday
ive been a seeking work
i have said he
i said to mysel id keep a civil tongue in my head let who would say what em would
id set my teeth into my tongue sooner nor speak i haste
for that mans sakeyo understand jerking his thumb back in some unknown direction
no i dont said mr hale seeing he waited for some kind of assent and completely bewildered as to who that man could be
that chap as lies theer said he with another jerk
him as went and drownded himself poor chap
i did na think hed got it in him to lie still and let the water creep oer him till he died
boucher yo know  yes i know now said mr hale
go back to what you were saying youd not speak in haste  for his sake
yet not for his sake for whereer he is and whateer hell neer know other clemming or cold again but for the wifes sake and the bits o childer  god bless you said mr hale starting up then calming down he said breathlessly what do you mean
tell me out  i have telled yo said higgins a little surprised at mr hales agitation
i would na ask for work for mysel but thems left as a charge on me
i reckon i would ha guided boucher to a better end but i set him off o th road and so i mun answer for him  mr hale got hold of higginss hand and shook it heartily without speaking
higgins looked awkward and ashamed
theer theer master
theers neer a man to call a man amongst us but what would do th same ay and better too for belie me ise neer got a stroke o work nor yet a sight of any
for all i telled hamper that let alone his pledgewhich i would not signno i could na not een for thished neer ha such a worker on his mill as i would behed ha none o meno more would none o th others
im a poor black feckless sheepchilder may clem for ought i can do unless parson yod help me  help you
how
i would do anythingbut what can i do  miss therefor margaret had reentered the room and stood silent listeninghas often talked grand o the south and the ways down there
now i dunnot know how far off it is but i been thinking if i could get em down theer where food is cheap and wages good and all the folk rich and poor master and man friendly like yo could may be help me to work
im not fortyfive and ive a deal o strength in me measter  but what kind of work could you do my man  well i reckon i could spade a bit  and for that said margaret stepping forwards for anything you could do higgins with the best will in the world you would may be get nine shillings a week may be ten at the outside
food is much the same as here except that you might have a little garden  the childer could work at that said he
im sick o milton anyways and milton is sick o me  you must not go the south said margaret for all that
you could not stand it
you would have to be out all weathers
it would kill you with rheumatism
the mere bodily work at your time of life would break you down
the fare is far different to what you have been accustomed to  ise nought particular about my meat said he as if offended
but youve reckoned on having butchers meat once a day if youre in work pay for that out of your ten shillings and keep those poor children if you can
i owe it to yousince its my way of talking that has set you off on this ideato put it all clear before you
you would not bear the dulness of the life you dont know what it is it would eat you away like rust
those that have lived there all their lives are used to soaking in the stagnant waters
they labour on from day to day in the great solitude of steaming fieldsnever speaking or lifting up their poor bent downcast heads
the hard spadework robs their brain of life the sameness of their toil deadens their imagination they dont care to meet to talk over thoughts and speculations even of the weakest wildest kind after their work is done they go home brutishly tired poor creatures
caring for nothing but food and rest
you could not stir them up into any companionship which you get in a town as plentiful as the air you breathe whether it be good or badand that i dont know but i do know that you of all men are not one to bear a life among such labourers
what would be peace to them would be eternal fretting to you
think no more of it nicholas i beg
besides you could never pay to get mother and children all therethats one good thing  ive reckoned for that
one house mun do for us a and the furniture o tother would go a good way
and men theer mun have their families to keepmappen six or seven childer
god help em said he more convinced by his own presentation of the facts than by all margaret had said and suddenly renouncing the idea which had but recently formed itself in a brain worn out by the days fatigue and anxiety
god help em
north an south have each getten their own troubles
if works sure and steady theer labours paid at starvation wages while here wen rucks o money coming in one quarter and neer a farthing th next
for sure th world is in a confusion that passes me or any other man to understand it needs fettling and whos to fettle it if its as yon folks say and theres nought but what we see  mr hale was busy cutting bread and butter margaret was glad of this for she saw that higgins was better left to himself that if her father began to speak ever so mildly on the subject of higginss thoughts the latter would consider himself challenged to an argument and would feel himself bound to maintain his own ground
she and her father kept up an indifferent conversation until higgins scarcely aware whether he ate or not had made a very substantial meal
then he pushed his chair away from the table and tried to take an interest in what they were saying but it was of no use and he fell back into dreamy gloom
suddenly margaret said she had been thinking of it for some time but the words had stuck in her throat higgins have you been to marlborough mills to seek for work  thorntons asked he
ay ive been at thorntons  and what did he say  such a chap as me is not like to see the measter
th oerlooker bid me go and be dd  i wish you had seen mr thornton said mr hale
he might not have given you work but he would not have used such language  as to th language im welly used to it it dunnot matter to me
im not nesh mysel when im put out
it were th fact that i were na wanted theer no more nor ony other place as i minded  but i wish you had seen mr thornton repeated margaret
would you go againits a good deal to ask i knowbut would you go tomorrow and try him
i should be so glad if you would  im afraid it would be of no use said mr hale in a low voice
it would be better to let me speak to him margaret still looked at higgins for his answer
those grave soft eyes of hers were difficult to resist
he gave a great sigh
it would tax my pride above a bit if it were for mysel i could stand a deal o clemming first id sooner knock him down than ask a favour from him
id a deal sooner be flogged mysel but yore not a common wench axing yor pardon nor yet have yo common ways about yo
ill een make a wry face and go at it tomorrow
dunna yo think that hell do it
that man has it in him to be burnt at the stake afore hell give in
ill do it for yor sake miss hale and its first time in my life as eer i give way to a woman
neither my wife nor bess could eer say that much again me  all the more do i thank you said margaret smiling
though i dont believe you i believe you have just given way to wife and daughter as much as most men  and as to mr thornton said mr hale ill give you a note to him which i think i may venture say will ensure you a hearing  i thank yo kindly sir but id as lief stand on my own bottom
i dunnot stomach the notion of having favour curried for me by one as doesnt know the ins and outs of the quarrel
meddling twixt master and man is liker meddling twixt husband and wife than aught else it takes a deal of wisdom to do ony good
ill stand guard at the lodge door
ill stand there fro six in the morning till i get speech on him
but id liefer sweep th streets if paupers had na got hold on that work
dunna yo hope miss
therell be more chance o getting milk out of a flint
i wish yo a very good night and many thanks to yo  youll find your shoes by the kitchen fire i took them there to dry said margaret
he turned round and looked at her steadily and then he brushed his lean hand across his eyes and went his way
how proud that man is said her father who was a little annoyed at the manner in which higgins had declined his intercession with mr thornton
he is said margaret but what grand makings of a man there are in him pride and all  its amusing to see how he evidently respects the part in mr thorntons character which is like his own  theres granite in all these northern people papa is there not  there was none in poor boucher i am afraid none in his wife either  i should guess by their tones that they had irish blood in them
i wonder what success hell have tomorrow
if he and mr thornton would speak out together as man to manif higgins would forget that mr thornton was a master and speak to him as he does to usand if mr thornton would be patient enough to listen to him with his human heart not with his masters ears  you are getting to do mr thornton justice at last margaret said her father pinching her ear
margaret had a strange choking at her heart which made her unable to answer oh thought she i wish i were a man that i could go and force him to express his disapprobation and tell him honestly that i knew i deserved it
it seems hard to lose him as a friend just when i had begun to feel his value
how tender he was with dear mamma
if it were only for her sake i wish he would come and then at least i should know how much i was abased in his eyes      promises fulfilled
then proudly proudly up she rose        tho the tear was in her ee      whateer ye say think what ye may        yes get na word frae me                    scotch ballad
it was not merely that margaret was known to mr thornton to have spoken falselythough she imagined that for this reason only was she so turned in his opinionbut that this falsehood of hers bore a distinct reference in his mind to some other lover
he could not forget the fond and earnest look that had passed between her and some other manthe attitude of familiar confidence if not of positive endearment
the thought of this perpetually stung him it was a picture before his eyes wherever he went and whatever he was doing
in addition to this and he ground his teeth as he remembered it was the hour dusky twilight the place so far away from home and comparatively unfrequented
his nobler self had said at first that all this last might be accidental innocent justifiable but once allow her right to love and be beloved and had he any reason to deny her righthad not her words been severely explicit when she cast his love away from her
 she might easily have been beguiled into a longer walk on to a later hour than she had anticipated
but that falsehood
which showed a fatal consciousness of something wrong and to be concealed which was unlike her
he did her that justice though all the time it would have been a relief to believe her utterly unworthy of his esteem
it was this that made the miserythat he passionately loved her and thought her even with all her faults more lovely and more excellent than any other woman yet he deemed her so attached to some other man so led away by her affection for him as to violate her truthful nature
the very falsehood that stained her was a proof how blindly she loved anotherthis dark slight elegant handsome manwhile he himself was rough and stern and strongly made
he lashed himself into an agony of fierce jealousy
he thought of that look that attitudehow he would have laid his life at her feet for such tender glances such fond detention
he mocked at himself for having valued the mechanical way in which she had protected him from the fury of the mob now he had seen how soft and bewitching she looked when with a man she really loved
he remembered point by point the sharpness of her wordsthere was not a man in all that crowd for whom she would not have done as much far more readily than for him he shared with the mob in her desire of averting bloodshed from them but this man this hidden lover shared with nobody he had looks words handcleavings lies concealment all to himself
mr thornton was conscious that he had never been so irritable as he was now in all his life long he felt inclined to give a short abrupt answer more like a bark than a speech to every one that asked him a question and this consciousness hurt his pride he had always piqued himself on his selfcontrol and control himself he would
so the manner was subdued to a quiet deliberation but the matter was even harder and sterner than common
he was more than usually silent at home employing his evenings in a continual pace backwards and forwards which would have annoyed his mother exceedingly if it had been practised by any one else and did not tend to promote any forbearance on her part even to this beloved son
can you stopcan you sit down for a moment
i have something to say to you if you would give up that everlasting walk walk walk  he sat down instantly on a chair against the wall
i want to speak to you about betsy
she says she must leave us that her lovers death has so affected her spirits she cant give her heart to her work  very well
i suppose other cooks are to be met with  thats so like a man
its not merely the cooking it is that she knows all the ways of the house
besides she tells me something about your friend miss hale  miss hale is no friend of mine
mr hale is my friend  i am glad to hear you say so for if she had been your friend what betsy says would have annoyed you  let me hear it said he with the extreme quietness of manner he had been assuming for the last few days
betsy says that the night on which her loveri forget his namefor she always calls him he  leonards  the night on which leonards was last seen at the stationwhen he was last seen on duty in factmiss hale was there walking about with a young man who bessy believes killed leonards by some blow or push  leonards was not killed by any blow or push  how do you know  because i distinctly put the question to the surgeon of the infirmary
he told me there was an internal disease of long standing caused by leonards habit of drinking to excess that the fact of his becoming rapidly worse while in a state of intoxication settled the question as to whether the last fatal attack was caused by excess of drinking or the fall  the fall
what fall  caused by the blow or push of which betsy speaks  then there was a blow or push  i believe so  and who did it  as there was no inquest in consequence of the doctors opinion i cannot tell you  but miss hale was there  no answer
and with a young man  still no answer
at last he said i tell you mother that there was no inquestno inquiry
no judicial inquiry i mean  betsy says that woolmer some man she knows who is in a grocers shop out at crampton can swear that miss hale was at the station at that hour walking backwards and forwards with a young man  i dont see what we have to do with that
miss hale is at liberty to please herself  im glad to hear you say so says mrs thornton eagerly
it certainly signifies very little to usnot at all to you after what has passed
but ii made a promise to mrs hale that i would not allow her daughter to go wrong without advising and remonstrating with her
i shall certainly let her know my opinion of such conduct  i do not see any harm in what she did that evening said mr thornton getting up and coming near to his mother he stood by the chimneypiece with his face turned away from the room
you would not have approved of fannys being seen out after dark in rather a lonely place walking about with a young man
i say nothing of the taste which could choose the time when her mother lay unburied for such a promenade
should you have liked your sister to have been noticed by a grocers assistant for doing so  in the first place as it is not many years since i myself was a drapers assistant the mere circumstance of a grocers assistant noticing any act does not alter the character of the act to me
and in the next place i see a great deal of difference between miss hale and fanny
i can imagine that the one may have weighty reasons which may and ought to make her overlook any seeming impropriety in her conduct
i never knew fanny have weighty reasons for anything
other people must guard her
i believe miss hale is a guardian to herself  a pretty character of your sister indeed
really john one would have thought miss hale had done enough to make you clearsighted
she drew you on to an offer by a bold display of pretended regard for youto play you off against this very young man ive no doubt
her whole conduct is clear to me now
you believe he is her lover i supposeyou agree to that  he turned round to his mother his face was very gray and grim
yes mother
i do believe he is her lover when he had spoken he turned round again he writhed himself about like one in bodily pain
he leant his face against his hand
then before she could speak he turned sharp again  mother
he is her lover whoever he is but she may need help and womanly counselthere may be difficulties or temptations which i dont know
i fear there are
i dont want to know what they are but as you have ever been a gooday
and a tender mother to me go to her and gain her confidence and tell her what is best to be done
i know that something is wrong some dread which must be a terrible torture to her  for gods sake john said his mother now really shocked what do you mean
what do you mean
what do you know  he did not reply to her
john
i dont know what i shant think unless you speak
you have no right to say what you have done against her  not against her mother
i could not speak against her  well
you have no right to say what you have done unless you say more
these halfexpressions are what ruin a womans character  her character
mother you do not dare he faced about and looked into her face with his flaming eyes
then drawing himself up into determined composure and dignity he said i will not say any more than this which is neither more nor less than the simple truth and i am sure you believe mei have good reason to believe that miss hale is in some strait and difficulty connected with an attachment which of itself from my knowledge of miss hales character is perfectly innocent and right
what my reason is i refuse to tell
but never let me hear any one say a word against her implying any more serious imputation than that she now needs the counsel of some kind and gentle woman
you promised mrs hale to be that woman  no said mrs thornton
i am happy to say i did not promise kindness and gentleness for i felt at the time that it might be out of my power to render these to one of miss hales character and disposition
i promised counsel and advice such as i would give to my own daughter i shall speak to her as i would do to fanny if she had gone gallivanting with a young man in the dusk
i shall speak with relation to the circumstances i know without being influenced either one way or another by the strong reasons which you will not confide to me
then i shall have fulfilled my promise and done my duty
she will never bear it said he passionately
she will have to bear it if i speak in her dead mothers name  well said he breaking away dont tell me any more about it
i cannot endure to think of it
it will be better that you should speak to her any way than that she should not be spoken to at alloh
that look of love continued he between his teeth as he bolted himself into his own private room
and that cursed lie which showed some terrible shame in the background to be kept from the light in which i thought she lived perpetually
oh margaret margaret
mother how you have tortured me
oh
margaret could you not have loved me
i am but uncouth and hard but i would never have led you into any falsehood for me  the more mrs thornton thought over what her son had said in pleading for a merciful judgment for margarets indiscretion the more bitterly she felt inclined towards her
she took a savage pleasure in the idea of speaking her mind to her in the guise of fulfilment of a duty
she enjoyed the thought of showing herself untouched by the glamour which she was well aware margaret had the power of throwing over many people
she snorted scornfully over the picture of the beauty of her victim her jet black hair her clear smooth skin her lucid eyes would not help to save her one word of the just and stern reproach which mrs thornton spent half the night in preparing to her mind
is miss hale within she knew she was for she had seen her at the window and she had her feet inside the little hall before martha had half answered the question
margaret was sitting alone writing to edith and giving her many particulars of her mothers last days
it was a softening employment and she had to brush away the unbidden tears as mrs thornton was announced
she was so gentle and ladylike in her mode of reception that her visitor was somewhat daunted and it became impossible to utter the speech so easy of arrangement with no one to address it to
margarets low rich voice was softer than usual her manner more gracious because in her heart she was feeling very grateful to mrs thornton for the courteous attention of her call
she exerted herself to find subjects of interest for conversation praised martha the servant whom mrs thornton had found for them had asked edith for a little greek air about which she had spoken to miss thornton
mrs thornton was fairly discomfited
her sharp damascus blade seemed out of place and useless among roseleaves
she was silent because she was trying to task herself up to her duty
at last she stung herself into its performance by a suspicion which in spite of all probability she allowed to cross her mind that all this sweetness was put on with a view of propitiating mr thornton that somehow the other attachment had fallen through and that it suited miss hales purpose to recall her rejected lover
poor margaret
there was perhaps so much truth in the suspicion as this that mrs thornton was the mother of one whose regard she valued and feared to have lost and this thought unconsciously added to her natural desire of pleasing one who was showing her kindness by her visit
mrs thornton stood up to go but yet she seemed to have something more to say
she cleared her throat and began  miss hale i have a duty to perform
i promised your poor mother that as far as my poor judgment went i would not allow you to act in any way wrongly or she softened her speech down a little here inadvertently without remonstrating at least without offering advice whether you took it or not  margaret stood before her blushing like any culprit with her eyes dilating as she gazed at mrs thornton
she thought she had come to speak to her about the falsehood she had toldthat mr thornton had employed her to explain the danger she had exposed herself to of being confuted in full court
and although her heart sank to think he had not rather chosen to come himself and upbraid her and receive her penitence and restore her again to his good opinion yet she was too much humbled not to bear any blame on this subject patiently and meekly
mrs thornton went on  at first when i heard from one of my servants that you had been seen walking about with a gentleman so far from home as the outwood station at such a time of the evening i could hardly believe it
but my son i am sorry to say confirmed her story
it was indiscreet to say the least many a young woman has lost her character before now  margarets eyes flashed fire
this was a new ideathis was too insulting
if mrs thornton had spoken to her about the lie she had told well and goodshe would have owned it and humiliated herself
but to interfere with her conductto speak of her character
shemrs thornton a mere strangerit was too impertinent
she would not answer hernot one word
mrs thornton saw the battlespirit in margarets eyes and it called up her combativeness also
for your mothers sake i have thought it right to warn you against such improprieties they must degrade you in the long run in the estimation of the world even if in fact they do not lead you to positive harm  for my mothers sake said margaret in a tearful voice i will bear much but i cannot bear everything
she never meant me to be exposed to insult i am sure  insult miss hale  yes madam said margaret more steadily it is insult
what do you know of me that should lead you to suspectoh said she breaking down and covering her face with her handsi know now mr thornton has told you  no miss hale said mrs thornton her truthfulness causing her to arrest the confession margaret was on the point of making though her curiosity was itching to hear it
stop
mr thornton has told me nothing
you do not know my son
you are not worthy to know him
he said this
listen young lady that you may understand if you can what sort of a man you rejected
this milton manufacturer his great tender heart scorned as it was scorned said to me only last night go to her
i have good reason to know that she is in some strait arising out of some attachment and she needs womanly counsel i believe those were his very words
farther than thatbeyond admitting the fact of your being at the outwood station with a gentleman on the evening of the twentysixthhe has said nothingnot one word against you
if he has knowledge of anything which should make you sob so he keeps it to himself  margarets face was still hidden in her hands the fingers of which were wet with tears
mrs thornton was a little mollified
come miss hale
there may be circumstances ill allow that if explained may take off from the seeming impropriety  still no answer
margaret was considering what to say she wished to stand well with mrs thornton and yet she could not might not give any explanation
mrs thornton grew impatient
i shall be sorry to break off an acquaintance but for fannys sakeas i told my son if fanny had done so we should consider it a great disgraceand fanny might be led away  i can give you no explanation said margaret in a low voice
i have done wrong but not in the way you think or know about
i think mr thornton judges me more mercifully than youshe had hard work to keep herself from choking with her tearsbut i believe madam you mean to do rightly  thank you said mrs thornton drawing herself up i was not aware that my meaning was doubted
it is the last time i shall interfere
i was unwilling to consent to do it when your mother asked me
i had not approved of my sons attachment to you while i only suspected it
you did not appear to me worthy of him
but when you compromised yourself as you did at the time of the riot and exposed yourself to the comments of servants and workpeople i felt it was no longer right to set myself against my sons wish of proposing to youa wish by the way which he had always denied entertaining until the day of the riot margaret winced and drew in her breath with a long hissing sound of which however mrs thornton took no notice
he came you had apparently changed your mind
i told my son yesterday that i thought it possible short as was the interval you might have heard or learnt something of this other lover  what must you think of me madam asked margaret throwing her head back with proud disdain till her throat curved outwards like a swans
you can say nothing more mrs thornton
i decline every attempt to justify myself for anything
you must allow me to leave the room  and she swept out of it with the noiseless grace of an offended princess
mrs thornton had quite enough of natural humour to make her feel the ludricrousness of the position in which she was left
there was nothing for it but to show herself out
she was not particularly annoyed at margarets way of behaving
she did not care enough for her for that
she had taken mrs thorntons remonstrance to the full as keenly to heart as that lady expected and margarets passion at once mollified her visitor far more than any silence or reserve could have done
it showed the effect of her words
my young lady thought mrs thornton to herself youve a pretty good temper of your own
if john and you had come together he would have had to keep a tight hand over you to make you know your place
but i dont think you will go awalking again with your beau at such an hour of the day in a hurry
youve too much pride and spirit in you for that
i like to see a girl fly out at the notion of being talked about
it shows theyre neither giddy nor bold by nature
as for that girl she might be bold but shed never be giddy
ill do her that justice
now as to fanny shed be giddy and not bold
shes no courage in her poor thing  mr thornton was not spending the morning so satisfactorily as his mother
she at any rate was fulfilling her determined purpose
he was trying to understand where he stood what damage the strike had done him
a good deal of his capital was locked up in new and expensive machinery and he had also bought cotton largely with a view to some great orders which he had in hand
the strike had thrown him terribly behindhand as to the completion of these orders
even with his own accustomed and skilled workpeople he would have had some difficulty in fulfilling his engagements as it was the incompetence of the irish hands who had to be trained to their work at a time requiring unusual activity was a daily annoyance
it was not a favourable hour for higgins to make his request
but he had promised margaret to do it at any cost
so though every moment added to his repugnance his pride and his sullenness of temper he stood leaning against the dead wall hour after hour first on one leg then on the other
at last the latch was sharply lifted and out came mr thornton
i want for to speak to yo sir  cant stay now my man
im too late as it is  well sir i reckon i can wait till yo come back  mr thornton was half way down the street
higgins sighed
but it was no use
to catch him in the street was his only chance of seeing the measter if he had rung the lodge bell or even gone up to the house to ask for him he would have been referred to the overlooker
so he stood still again vouchsafing no answer but a short nod of recognition to the few men who knew and spoke to him as the crowd drove out the millyard at dinnertime and scowling with all his might at the irish knobsticks who had just been imported
at last mr thornton returned
what
you there still  ay sir i mun speak to yo  come in here then
stay well go across the yard the men are not come back and we shall have it to ourselves
these good people i see are at dinner said he closing the door of the porters lodge
he stopped to speak to the overlooker
the latter said in a low tone  i suppose you know sir that that man is higgins one of the leaders of the union he that made that speech in hurstfield  no i didnt said mr thornton looking round sharply at his follower
higgins was known to him by name as a turbulent spirit
come along said he and his tone was rougher than before
it is men such as this thought he who interrupt commerce and injure the very town they live in mere demagogues lovers of power at whatever cost to others  well sir
what do you want with me said mr thornton facing round at him as soon as they were in the countinghouse of the mill
my name is higgins  i know that broke in mr thornton
what do you want mr higgins
thats the question  i want work  work
youre a pretty chap to come asking me for work
you dont want impudence thats very clear  ive getten enemies and backbiters like my betters but i neer heerd o ony of them calling me oermodest said higgins
his blood was a little roused by mr thorntons manner more than by his words
mr thornton saw a letter addressed to himself on the table
he took it up and read it through
at the end he looked up and said what are you waiting for  an answer to th question i axed  i gave it you before
dont waste any more of your time  yo made a remark sir on my impudence but i were taught that it was manners to say either yes or no when i were axed a civil question
i should be thankfu to yo if yod give me work
hamper will speak to my being a good hand  ive a notion youd better not send me to hamper to ask for a character my man
i might hear more than youd like  id take th risk
worst they could say of me is that i did what i thought best even to my own wrong  youd better go and try them then and see whether theyll give you work
ive turned off upwards of a hundred of my best hands for no other fault than following you and such as you and dye think ill take you on
i might as well put a firebrand into the midst of the cottonwaste  higgins turned away then the recollection of boucher came over him and he faced round with the greatest concession he could persuade himself to make
id promise yo measter id not speak a word as could do harm if so be yo did right by us and id promise more id promise that when i seed yo going wrong and acting unfair id speak to yo in private first and that would be a fair warning
if yo and i did na agree in our opinion o your conduct yo might turn me off at an hours notice  upon my word you dont think small beer of yourself
hamper has had a loss of you
how came he to let you and your wisdom go  well we parted wi mutual dissatisfaction
i wouldnt gie the pledge they were asking and they wouldnt have me at no rate
so im free to make another engagement and as i said before though i should na say it im a good hand measter and a steady manspecially when i can keep fro drink and that i shall do now if i neer did afore  that you may have more money laid up for another strike i suppose  no
id be thankful if i was free to do that its for to keep th widow and childer of a man who was drove mad by them knobsticks o yourn put out of his place by a paddy that did na know weft fro warp  well
youd better turn to something else if youve any such good intention in your head
i shouldnt advise you to stay in milton youre too well known here  if it were summer said higgins id take to paddys work and go as a navvy or haymaking or summat and neer see milton again
but its winter and th childer will clem  a pretty navvy youd make
why you couldnt do half a days work at digging against an irishman  id only charge halfaday for th twelve hours if i could only do halfadays work in th time
yore not knowing of any place where they could gi me a trial away fro the mills if im such a firebrand
id take any wage they thought i was worth for the sake of those childer  dont you see what you would be
youd be a knobstick
youd be taking less wages than the other labourersall for the sake of another mans children
think how youd abuse any poor fellow who was willing to take what he could get to keep his own children
you and your union would soon be down upon him
no
no
if its only for the recollection of the way in which youve used the poor knobsticks before now i say no
to your question
ill not give you work
i wont say i dont believe your pretext for coming and asking for work i know nothing about it
it may be true or it may not
its a very unlikely story at any rate
let me pass
ill not give you work
theres your answer  i hear sir
i would na ha troubled you but that i were bid to come by one as seemed to think yod getten some place in your heart
hoo were mistook and i were misled
but im not the first man as is misled by a woman  tell her to mind her own business the next time instead of taking up your time and mine too
i believe women are at the bottom of every plague in this world
be off with you  im obleeged to you for a yor kindness measter and most of a for yor civil way o saying goodbye  mr thornton did not deign a reply
but looking out of the window a minute later he was struck with the lean bent figure going out of the yard the heavy walk was in strange contrast with the resolute clear determination of the man to speak to him
he crossed to the porters lodge  how long has that man higgins been waiting to speak to me  he was outside the gate before eight oclock sir
i think hes been there ever since  and it is now  just one sir  five hours thought mr thornton its a long time for a man to wait doing nothing but first hoping and then fearing      making friends
nay i have done you get no more of me     and i am glad yea glad with all my heart     that thus so clearly i myself am free               drayton
margaret shut herself up in her own room after she had quitted mrs thornton
she began to walk backwards and forwards in her old habitual way of showing agitation but then remembering that in that slightlybuilt house every step was heard from one room to another she sate down until she heard mrs thornton go safely out of the house
she forced herself to recollect all the conversation that had passed between them speech by speech she compelled her memory to go through with it
at the end she rose up and said to herself in a melancholy tone  at any rate her words do not touch me they fall off from me for i am innocent of all the motives she attributes to me
but still it is hard to think that any oneany womancan believe all this of another so easily
it is hard and sad
where i have done wrong she does not accuse meshe does not know
he never told her i might have known he would not  she lifted up her head as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which mr thornton had shown
then as a new thought came across her she pressed her hands tightly together  he too must take poor frederick for some lover she blushed as the word passed through her mind
i see it now
it is not merely that he knows of my falsehood but he believes that some one else cares for me and that i oh dearoh dear
what shall i do
what do i mean
why do i care what he thinks beyond the mere loss of his good opinion as regards my telling the truth or not
i cannot tell
but i am very miserable
oh how unhappy this last year has been
i have passed out of childhood into old age
i have had no youthno womanhood the hopes of womanhood have closed for mefor i shall never marry and i anticipate cares and sorrows just as if i were an old woman and with the same tearful spirit
i am weary of this continual call upon me for strength
i could bear up for papa because that is a natural pious duty
and i think i could bear up againstat any rate i could have the energy to resent mrs thorntons unjust impertinent suspicions
but it is hard to feel how completely he must misunderstand me
what has happened to make me so morbid today
i do not know
i only know i cannot help it
i must give way sometimes
no i will not though said she springing to her feet
i will noti will not think of myself and my own position
i wont examine into my own feelings
it would be of no use now
some time if i live to be an old woman i may sit over the fire and looking into the embers see the life that might have been  all this time she was hastily putting on her things to go out only stopping from time to time to wipe her eyes with an impatience of gesture at the tears that would come again in spite of all her bravery
i dare say theres many a woman makes as sad a mistake as i have done and only finds it out too late
and how proudly and impertinently i spoke to him that day
but i did not know then
it has come upon me little by little and i dont know where it began
now i wont give way
i shall find it difficult to behave in the same way to him with this miserable consciousness upon me but i will be very calm and very quiet and say very little
but to be sure i may not see him he keeps out of our way evidently
that would be worse than all
and yet no wonder that he avoids me believing what he must about me  she went out going rapidly towards the country and trying to drown reflection by swiftness of motion
as she stood on the doorstep at her return her father came up  good girl said he
youve been to mrs bouchers
i was just meaning to go there if i had time before dinner  no papa i have not said margaret reddening
i never thought about her
but i will go directly after dinner i will go while you are taking your nap  accordingly margaret went
mrs boucher was very ill really illnot merely ailing
the kind and sensible neighbour who had come in the other day seemed to have taken charge of everything
some of the children were gone to the neighbours
mary higgins had come for the three youngest at dinnertime and since then nicholas had gone for the doctor
he had not come as yet mrs boucher was dying and there was nothing to do but wait
margaret thought that she should like to hear his opinion and that she could not do better than go and see the higginses in the meantime
she might then possibly hear whether nicholas had been able to make his application to mr thornton
she found nicholas busily engaged in making a penny spin on the dresser for the amusement of three little children who were clinging to him in a fearless manner
he as well as they was smiling at a good long spin and margaret thought that the happy look of interest in his occupation was a good sign
when the penny stopped spinning lile johnnie began to cry
come to me said margaret taking him off the dresser and holding him in her arms she held her watch to his ear while she asked nicholas if he had seen mr thornton
the look on his face changed instantly
ay said he
ive seen and heerd too much on him  he refused you then said margaret sorrowfully
to be sure
i knew hed do it all along
its no good expecting marcy at the hands o them measters
yor a stranger and a foreigner and arent likely to know their ways but i knowed it  i am sorry i asked you
was he angry
he did not speak to you as hamper did did he  he werent oercivil said nicholas spinning the penny again as much for his own amusement as for that of the children
never yo fret im only where i was
ill go on tramp tomorrow
i gave him as good as i got
i telled him id not that good opinion on him that id ha come a second time of mysel but yod advised me for to come and i were beholden to yo  you told him i sent you  i dunno if i cad yo by your name
i dunnot think i did
i said a woman who knew no better had advised me for to come and see if there was a soft place in his heart  and he asked margaret
said i were to tell yo to mind yor own businessthats the longest spin yet my ladsand thems civil words to what he used to me
but neer mind
were but where we was and ill break stones on the road afore i let these little uns clem  margaret put the struggling johnnie out of her arms back into his former place on the dresser
i am sorry i asked you to go to mr thorntons
i am disappointed in him  there was a slight noise behind her
both she and nicholas turned round at the same moment and there stood mr thornton with a look of displeased surprise upon his face
obeying her swift impulse margaret passed out before him saying not a word only bowing low to hide the sudden paleness that she felt had come over her face
he bent equally low in return and then closed the door after her
as she hurried to mrs bouchers she heard the clang and it seemed to fill up the measure of her mortification
he too was annoyed to find her there
he had tenderness in his hearta soft place as nicholas higgins called it but he had some pride in concealing it he kept it very sacred and safe and was jealous of every circumstance that tried to gain admission
but if he dreaded exposure of his tenderness he was equally desirous that all men should recognise his justice and he felt that he had been unjust in giving so scornful a hearing to any one who had waited with humble patience for five hours to speak to him
that the man had spoken saucily to him when he had the opportunity was nothing to mr thornton
he rather liked him for it and he was conscious of his own irritability of temper at the time which probably made them both quits
it was the five hours of waiting that struck mr thornton
he had not five hours to spare himself but one hourtwo hours of his hard penetrating intellectual as well as bodily labour did he give up to going about collecting evidence as to the truth of higginss story the nature of his character the tenor of his life
he tried not to be but was convinced that all that higgins had said was true
and then the conviction went in as if by some spell and touched the latent tenderness of his heart the patience of the man the simple generosity of the motive for he had learnt about the quarrel between boucher and higgins made him forget entirely the mere reasonings of justice and overleap them by a diviner instinct
he came to tell higgins he would give him work and he was more annoyed to find margaret there than by hearing her last words for then he understood that she was the woman who had urged higgins to come to him and he dreaded the admission of any thought of her as a motive to what he was doing solely because it was right
so that was the lady you spoke of as a woman said he indignantly to higgins
you might have told me who she was  and then maybe yod have spoken of her more civil than yo did yod getten a mother who might ha kept yor tongue in check when yo were talking o women being at the root of all the plagues  of course you told that to miss hale  in coorse i did
leastways i reckon i did
i telled her she werent to meddle again in aught that concerned yo  whose children are thoseyours mr thornton had a pretty good notion whose they were from what he had heard but he felt awkward in turning the conversation round from this unpromising beginning
theyre not mine and they are mine  they are the children you spoke of to me this morning  when yo said replied higgins turning round with illsmothered fierceness that my story might be true or might not but it were a very unlikely one
measter ive not forgotten  mr thornton was silent for a moment then he said no more have i i remember what i said
i spoke to you about those children in a way i had no business to
i did not believe you
i could not have taken care of another mans children myself if he had acted towards me as i hear boucher did towards you
but i know now you spoke truth
i beg your pardon  higgins did not turn round or immediately respond to this
but when he did speak it was in a softened tone although the words were gruff enough
yove no business to go prying into what happened between boucher and me
hes dead and im sorry
thats enough  so it is
will you take work with me
thats what i came to ask  higginss obstinacy wavered recovered strength and stood firm
he would not speak
mr thornton would not ask again
higginss eye fell on the children
yove called me impudent and a liar and a mischiefmaker and yo might ha said wi some truth as i were now and then given to drink
an i ha called you a tyrant an an oud bull dog and a hard cruel master thats where it stands
but for th childer measter do yo think we can eer get on together  well said mr thornton halflaughing it was not my proposal that we should go together
but theres one comfort on your own showing
we neither of us can think much worse of the other than we do now  thats true said higgins reflectively
ive been thinking ever sin i saw you what a marcy it were yo did na take me on for that i neer saw a man whom i could less abide
but thats maybe been a hasty judgment and works work to such as me
so measter ill come and whats more i thank yo and thats a deal fro me said he more frankly suddenly turning round and facing mr thornton fully for the first time
and this is a deal from me said mr thornton giving higginss hand a good grip
now mind you come sharp to your time continued he resuming the master
ill have no laggards at my mill
what fines we have we keep pretty sharply
and the first time i catch you making mischief off you go
so now you know where you are  yo spoke of my wisdom this morning
i reckon i may bring it wi me or would yo rayther have me bout my brains  bout your brains if you use them for meddling with my business with your brains if you can keep to your own  i shall need a deal o brains to settle where my business ends and yors begins  your business has not begun yet and mine stands still for me
so good afternoon  just before mr thornton came up to mrs bouchers door margaret came out of it
she did not see him and he followed her for several yards admiring her light and easy walk and her tall and graceful figure
but suddenly this simple emotion of pleasure was tainted poisoned by jealousy
he wished to overtake her and speak to her to see how she would receive him now she must know he was aware of some other attachment
he wished too but of this wish he was rather ashamed that she should know that he had justified her wisdom in sending higgins to him to ask for work and had repented him of his mornings decision
he came up to her
she started
allow me to say miss hale that you were rather premature in expressing your disappointment
i have taken higgins on  i am glad of it said she coldly
he tells me he repeated to you what i said this morning about mr thornton hesitated
margaret took it up  about women not meddling
you had a perfect right to express your opinion which was a very correct one i have no doubt
but she went on a little more eagerly higgins did not quite tell you the exact truth the word truth reminded her of her own untruth and she stopped short feeling exceedingly uncomfortable
mr thornton at first was puzzled to account for her silence and then he remembered the lie she had told and all that was foregone
the exact truth said he
very few people do speak the exact truth
i have given up hoping for it
miss hale have you no explanation to give me
you must perceive what i cannot but think  margaret was silent
she was wondering whether an explanation of any kind would be consistent with her loyalty to frederick
nay said he i will ask no farther
i may be putting temptation in your way
at present believe me your secret is safe with me
but you run great risks allow me to say in being so indiscreet
i am only speaking as a friend of your fathers if i had any other thought or hope of course that is at an end
i am quite disinterested  i am aware of that said margaret forcing herself to speak in an indifferent careless way
i am aware of what i must appear to you but the secret is another persons and i cannot explain it without doing him harm  i have not the slightest wish to pry into the gentlemans secrets he said with growing anger
my own interest in you issimply that of a friend
you may not believe me miss hale but it isin spite of the persecution im afraid i threatened you with at one timebut that is all given up all passed away
you believe me miss hale  yes said margaret quietly and sadly
then really i dont see any reason for us to go on walking together
i thought perhaps you might have had something to say but i see we are nothing to each other
if youre quite convinced that any foolish passion on my part is entirely over i wish you good afternoon he walked off very hastily
what can he mean thought margaretwhat could he mean by speaking so as if i were always thinking that he cared for me when i know he does not he cannot
his mother will have said all those cruel things about me to him
but i wont care for him
i surely am mistress enough of myself to control this wild strange miserable feeling which tempted me even to betray my own dear frederick so that i might but regain his good opinionthe good opinion of a man who takes such pains to tell me that i am nothing to him
come
poor little heart
be cheery and brave
well be a great deal to one another if we are thrown off and left desolate  her father was almost startled by her merriment this morning
she talked incessantly and forced her natural humour to an unusual pitch and if there was a tinge of bitterness in much of what she said if her accounts of the old harley street set were a little sarcastic her father could not bear to check her as he would have done at another timefor he was glad to see her shake off her cares
in the middle of the evening she was called down to speak to mary higgins and when she came back mr hale imagined that he saw traces of tears on her cheeks
but that could not be for she brought good newsthat higgins had got work at mr thorntons mill
her spirits were damped at any rate and she found it very difficult to go on talking at all much more in the wild way that she had done
for some days her spirits varied strangely and her father was beginning to be anxious about her when news arrived from one or two quarters that promised some change and variety for her
mr hale received a letter from mr bell in which that gentleman volunteered a visit to them and mr hale imagined that the promised society of his old oxford friend would give as agreeable a turn to margarets ideas as it did to his own
margaret tried to take an interest in what pleased her father but she was too languid to care about any mr bell even though he were twenty times her godfather
she was more roused by a letter from edith full of sympathy about her aunts death full of details about herself her husband and child and at the end saying that as the climate did not suit the baby and as mrs shaw was talking of returning to england she thought it probable that captain lennox might sell out and that they might all go and live again in the old harley street house which however would seem very incomplete without margaret
margaret yearned after that old house and the placid tranquility of that wellordered monotonous life
she had found it occasionally tiresome while it lasted but since then she had been buffeted about and felt so exhausted by this recent struggle with herself that she thought that even stagnation would be a rest and a refreshment
so she began to look towards a long visit to the lennoxes on their return to england as to a pointno not of hopebut of leisure in which she could regain her power and command over herself
at present it seemed to her as if all subjects tended towards mr thornton as if she could not forget him with all her endeavours
if she went to see the higginses she heard of him there her father had resumed their readings together and quoted his opinions perpetually even mr bells visit brought his tenants name upon the tapis for he wrote word that he believed he must be occupied some great part of his time with mr thornton as a new lease was in preparation and the terms of it must be agreed upon
out of tune
i have no wrong where i can claim no right      naught taen me fro where i have nothing had      yet of my woe i cannot so be quite      namely since that another may be glad      with that that thus in sorrow makes me sad                               wyatt
margaret had not expected much pleasure to herself from mr bells visitshe had only looked forward to it on her fathers account but when her godfather came she at once fell into the most natural position of friendship in the world
he said she had no merit in being what she was a girl so entirely after his own heart it was an hereditary power which she had to walk in and take possession of his regard while she in reply gave him much credit for being so fresh and young under his fellows cap and gown
fresh and young in warmth and kindness i mean
im afraid i must own that i think your opinions are the oldest and mustiest i have met with this long time  hear this daughter of yours hale
her residence in milton has quite corrupted her
shes a democrat a red republican a member of the peace society a socialist  papa its all because im standing up for the progress of commerce
mr bell would have had it keep still at exchanging wildbeast skins for acorns  no no
id dig the ground and grow potatoes
and id shave the wildbeast skin and make the wool into broadcloth
dont exaggerate missy
but im tired of this bustle
everybody rushing over everybody in their hurry to get rich  it is not everyone who can sit comfortably in a set of college rooms and let his riches grow without any exertion of his own
no doubt there is many a man here who would be thankful if his property would increase as yours has done without his taking any trouble about it said mr hale
i dont believe they would
its the bustle and the struggle they like
as for sitting still and learning from the past or shaping out the future by faithful work done in a prophetic spiritwhy
pooh
i dont believe theres a man in milton who knows how to sit still and it is a great art  milton people i suspect think oxford men dont know how to move
it would be a very good thing if they mixed a little more  it might be good for the miltoners
many things might be good for them which would be very disagreeable for other people  are you not a milton man yourself asked margaret
i should have thought you would have been proud of your town  i confess i dont see what there is to be proud of
if youll only come to oxford margaret i will show you a place to glory in  well said mr hale mr
thornton is coming to drink tea with us tonight and he is as proud of milton as you of oxford
you two must try and make each other a little more liberalminded  i dont want to be more liberalminded thank you said mr bell
is mr thornton coming to tea papa asked margaret in a low voice
either to tea or soon after
he could not tell
he told us not to wait  mr thornton had determined that he would make no inquiry of his mother as to how far she had put her project into execution of speaking to margaret about the impropriety of her conduct
he felt pretty sure that if this interview took place his mothers account of what passed at it would only annoy and chagrin him though he would all the time be aware of the colouring which it received by passing through her mind
he shrank from hearing margarets very name mentioned he while he blamed herwhile he was jealous of herwhile he renounced herhe loved her sorely in spite of himself
he dreamt of her he dreamt she came dancing towards him with outspread arms and with a lightness and gaiety which made him loathe her even while it allured him
but the impression of this figure of margaretwith all margarets character taken out of it as completely as if some evil spirit had got possession of her formwas so deeply stamped upon his imagination that when he wakened he felt hardly able to separate the una from the duessa and the dislike he had to the latter seemed to envelop and disfigure the former
yet he was too proud to acknowledge his weakness by avoiding the sight of her
he would neither seek an opportunity of being in her company nor avoid it
to convince himself of his power of selfcontrol he lingered over every piece of business this afternoon he forced every movement into unnatural slowness and deliberation and it was consequently past eight oclock before he reached mr hales
then there were business arrangements to be transacted in the study with mr bell and the latter kept on sitting over the fire and talking wearily long after all business was transacted and when they might just as well have gone upstairs
but mr thornton would not say a word about moving their quarters he chafed and chafed and thought mr bell a most prosy companion while mr bell returned the compliment in secret by considering mr thornton about as brusque and curt a fellow as he had ever met with and terribly gone off both in intelligence and manner
at last some slight noise in the room above suggested the desirableness of moving there
they found margaret with a letter open before her eagerly discussing its contents with her father
on the entrance of the gentlemen it was immediately put aside but mr thorntons eager senses caught some few words of mr hales to mr bell
a letter from henry lennox
it makes margaret very hopeful  mr bell nodded
margaret was red as a rose when mr thornton looked at her
he had the greatest mind in the world to get up and go out of the room that very instant and never set foot in the house again
we were thinking said mr hale that you and mr thornton had taken margarets advice and were each trying to convert the other you were so long in the study  and you thought there would be nothing left of us but an opinion like the kilkenny cats tail
pray whose opinion did you think would have the most obstinate vitality  mr thornton had not a notion what they were talking about and disdained to inquire
mr hale politely enlightened him
mr
thornton we were accusing mr bell this morning of a kind of oxonian medival bigotry against his native town and wemargaret i believesuggested that it would do him good to associate a little with milton manufacturers  i beg your pardon
margaret thought it would do the milton manufacturers good to associate a little more with oxford men
now wasnt it so margaret  i believe i thought it would do both good to see a little more of the otheri did not know it was my idea any more than papas  and so you see mr thornton we ought to have been improving each other downstairs instead of talking over vanished families of smiths and harrisons
however i am willing to do my part now
i wonder when you milton men intend to live
all your lives seem to be spent in gathering together the materials for life  by living i suppose you mean enjoyment  yes enjoymenti dont specify of what because i trust we should both consider mere pleasure as very poor enjoyment  i would rather have the nature of the enjoyment defined  well
enjoyment or leisureenjoyment of the power and influence which money gives
you are all striving for money
what do you want it for  mr thornton was silent
then he said i really dont know
but money is not what i strive for  what then  it is a home question
i shall have to lay myself open to such a catechist and i am not sure that i am prepared to do it  no said mr hale dont let us be personal in our catechism
you are neither of you representative men you are each of you too individual for that  i am not sure whether to consider that as a compliment or not
i should like to be the representative of oxford with its beauty and its learning and its proud old history
what do you say margaret ought i to be flattered  i dont know oxford
but there is a difference between being the representative of a city and the representative man of its inhabitants  very true miss margaret
now i remember you were against me this morning and were quite miltonian and manufacturing in your preferences  margaret saw the quick glance of surprise that mr thornton gave her and she was annoyed at the construction which he might put on this speech of mr bells
mr bell went on  ah
i wish i could show you our high streetour radcliffe square
i am leaving out our colleges just as i give mr thornton leave to omit his factories in speaking of the charms of milton
i have a right to abuse my birthplace
remember i am a milton man  mr thornton was annoyed more than he ought to have been at all that mr bell was saying
he was not in a mood for joking
at another time he could have enjoyed mr bells half testy condemnation of a town where the life was so at variance with every habit he had formed but now he was galled enough to attempt to defend what was never meant to be seriously attacked
i dont set up milton as a model of a town  not in architecture slyly asked mr bell
no
weve been too busy to attend to mere outward appearances  dont say mere outward appearances said mr hale gently
they impress us all from childhood upwardevery day of our life  wait a little while said mr thornton
remember we are of a different race from the greeks to whom beauty was everything and to whom mr bell might speak of a life of leisure and serene enjoyment much of which entered in through their outward senses
i dont mean to despise them any more than i would ape them
but i belong to teutonic blood it is little mingled in this part of england to what it is in others we retain much of their language we retain more of their spirit we do not look upon life as a time for enjoyment but as a time for action and exertion
our glory and our beauty arise out of our outward strength which makes us victorious over material resistance and over greater difficulties still
we are teutonic up here in darkshire in another way
we hate to have laws made for us at a distance
we wish people would allow us to right ourselves instead of continually meddling with their imperfect legislation
we stand up for selfgovernment and oppose centralisation  in short you would like the heptarchy back again
well at any rate i revoke what i said this morningthat you milton people did not reverence the past
you are regular worshippers of thor  if we do not reverence the past as you do in oxford it is because we want something which can apply to the present more directly
it is fine when the study of the past leads to a prophecy of the future
but to men groping in new circumstances it would be finer if the words of experience could direct us how to act in what concerns us most intimately and immediately which is full of difficulties to be encountered and upon the mode in which they are met and conquerednot merely pushed aside for the timedepends our future
but no
people can speak of utopia much more easily than of the next days duty and yet when that duty is all done by others who so ready to cry fie for shame  and all this time i dont see what you are talking about
would you milton men condescend to send up your todays difficulty to oxford
you have not tried us yet  mr thornton laughed outright at this
i believe i was talking with reference to a good deal that has been troubling us of late i was thinking of the strikes we have gone through which are troublesome and injurious things enough as i am finding to my cost
and yet this last strike under which i am smarting has been respectable  a respectable strike said mr bell
that sounds as if you were far gone in the worship of thor  margaret felt rather than saw that mr thornton was chagrined by the repeated turning into jest of what he was feeling as very serious
she tried to change the conversation from a subject about which one party cared little while to the other it was deeply because personally interesting
she forced herself to say something
edith says she finds the printed calicoes in corfu better and cheaper than in london  does she said her father i think that must be one of ediths exaggerations
are you sure of it margaret  i am sure she says so papa  then i am sure of the fact said mr bell
margaret i go so far in my idea of your truthfulness that it shall cover your cousins character
i dont believe a cousin of yours could exaggerate  is miss hale so remarkable for truth said mr thornton bitterly
the moment he had done so he could have bitten his tongue out
what was he
and why should he stab her with her shame in this way
how evil he was tonight possessed by illhumour at being detained so long from her irritated by the mention of some name because he thought it belonged to a more successful lover now illtempered because he had been unable to cope with a light heart against one who was trying by gay and careless speeches to make the evening pass pleasantly awaythe kind old friend to all parties whose manner by this time might be well known to mr thornton who had been acquainted with him for many years
and then to speak to margaret as he had done
she did not get up and leave the room as she had done in former days when his abruptness or his temper had annoyed her
she sat quite still after the first momentary glance of grieved surprise that made her eyes look like some childs who has met with an unexpected rebuff they slowly dilated into mournful reproachful sadness and then they fell and she bent over her work and did not speak again
but he could not help looking at her and he saw a sigh tremble over her body as if she quivered in some unwonted chill
he felt as the mother would have done in the midst of her rocking it and rating it had she been called away before her slow confiding smile implying perfect trust in mothers love had proved the renewing of its love
he gave short sharp answers he was uneasy and cross unable to discern between jest and earnest anxious only for a look a word of hers before which to prostrate himself in penitent humility
but she neither looked nor spoke
her round taper fingers flew in and out of her sewing as steadily and swiftly as if that were the business of her life
she could not care for him he thought or else the passionate fervour of his wish would have forced her to raise those eyes if but for an instant to read the late repentance in his
he could have struck her before he left in order that by some strange overt act of rudeness he might earn the privilege of telling her the remorse that gnawed at his heart
it was well that the long walk in the open air wound up this evening for him
it sobered him back into grave resolution that henceforth he would see as little of her as possiblesince the very sight of that face and form the very sounds of that voice like the soft winds of pure melody had such power to move him from his balance
well
he had known what love wasa sharp pang a fierce experience in the midst of whose flames he was struggling
but through the furnace he would fight his way out into the serenity of middle ageall the richer and more human for having known this great passion
when he had somewhat abruptly left the room margaret rose from her seat and began silently to fold up her work
the long seams were heavy and had an unusual weight for her languid arms
the round lines in her face took a lengthened straighter form and her whole appearance was that of one who had gone through a day of great fatigue
as the three prepared for bed mr bell muttered a little condemnation of mr thornton
i never saw a fellow so spoiled by success
he cant bear a word a jest of any kind
everything seems to touch on the soreness of his high dignity
formerly he was as simple and noble as the open day you could not offend him because he had no vanity  he is not vain now said margaret turning round from the table and speaking with quiet distinctness
tonight he has not been like himself
something must have annoyed him before he came here  mr bell gave her one of his sharp glances from above his spectacles
she stood it quite calmly but after she had left the room he suddenly asked  hale
did it ever strike you that thornton and your daughter have what the french call a tendresse for each other  never said mr hale first startled and then flurried by the new idea
no i am sure you are wrong i am almost certain you are mistaken
if there is anything it is all on mr thorntons side
poor fellow
i hope and trust he is not thinking of her for i am sure she would not have him  well
im a bachelor and have steered clear of love affairs all my life so perhaps my opinion is not worth having
or else i should say there were very pretty symptoms about her  then i am sure you are wrong said mr hale
he may care for her though she really has been almost rude to him at times
but shewhy margaret would never think of him im sure
such a thing has never entered her head  entering her heart would do
but i merely threw out a suggestion of what might be
i dare say i was wrong
and whether i was wrong or right im very sleepy so having disturbed your nights rest as i can see with my untimely fancies ill betake myself with an easy mind to my own  but mr hale resolved that he would not be disturbed by any such nonsensical idea so he lay awake determining not to think about it
mr bell took his leave the next day bidding margaret look to him as one who had a right to help and protect her in all her troubles of whatever nature they might be
to mr hale he said  that margaret of yours has gone deep into my heart
take care of her for she is a very precious creaturea great deal too good for miltononly fit for oxford in fact
the town i mean not the men
i cant match her yet
when i can i shall bring my young man to stand side by side with your young woman just as the genii in the arabian nights brought prince caralmazan to match with the fairys princess badoura  i beg youll do no such thing
remember the misfortunes that ensued and besides i cant spare margaret  no on second thoughts well have her to nurse us ten years hence when we shall be two cross old invalids
seriously hale
i wish youd leave milton which is a most unsuitable place for you though it was my recommendation in the first instance
if you would id swallow my shadows of doubts and take a college living and you and margaret should come and live at the parsonageyou to be a sort of lay curate and take the unwashed off my hands and she to be our housekeeperthe village lady bountifulby day and read us to sleep in the evenings
i could be very happy in such a life
what do you think of it  never said mr hale decidedly
my one great change has been made and my price of suffering paid
here i stay out my life and here will i be buried and lost in the crowd  i dont give up my plan yet
only i wont bait you with it any more just now
wheres the pearl
come margaret give me a farewell kiss and remember my dear where you may find a true friend as far as his capability goes
you are my child margaret
remember that and god bless you  so they fell back into the monotony of the quiet life they would henceforth lead
there was no invalid to hope and fear about even the higginsesso long a vivid interestseemed to have receded from any need of immediate thought
the boucher children left motherless orphans claimed what of margarets care she could bestow and she went pretty often to see mary higgins who had charge of them
the two families were living in one house the elder children were at humble schools the younger ones were tended in marys absence at her work by the kind neighbour whose good sense had struck margaret at the time of bouchers death
of course she was paid for her trouble and indeed in all his little plans and arrangements for these orphan children nicholas showed a sober judgment and regulated method of thinking which were at variance with his former more eccentric jerks of action
he was so steady at his work that margaret did not often see him during these winter months but when she did she saw that he winced away from any reference to the father of those children whom he had so fully and heartily taken under his care
he did not speak easily of mr thornton
to tell the truth said he he fairly bamboozles me
hes two chaps
one chap i knowed of old as were measter all oer
tother chap hasnt an ounce of measters flesh about him
how them two chaps is bound up in one body is a craddy for me to find out
ill not be beat by it though
meanwhile he comes here pretty often thats how i know the chap thats a man not a measter
and i reckon hes taken aback by me pretty much as i am by him for he sits and listens and stares as if i were some strange beast newly caught in some of the zones
but im none daunted
it would take a deal to daunt me in my own house as he sees
and i tell him some of my mind that i reckon hed ha been the better of hearing when he were a younger man  and does he not answer you asked mr hale
well
ill not say th advantage is all on his side for all i take credit for improving him above a bit
sometimes he says a rough thing or two which is not agreeable to look at at first but has a queer smack o truth in it when yo come to chew it
hell be coming tonight i reckon about them childers schooling
hes not satisfied wi the make of it and wants for t examine em  what are theybegan mr hale but margaret touching his arm showed him her watch
it is nearly seven she said
the evenings are getting longer now
come papa she did not breathe freely till they were some distance from the house
then as she became more calm she wished that she had not been in so great a hurry for somehow they saw mr thornton but very seldom now and he might have come to see higgins and for the old friendships sake she should like to have seen him tonight
yes
he came very seldom even for the dull cold purpose of lessons
mr hale was disappointed in his pupils lukewarmness about greek literature which had but a short time ago so great an interest for him
and now it often happened that a hurried note from mr thornton would arrive just at the last moment saying that he was so much engaged that he could not come to read with mr hale that evening
and though other pupils had taken more than his place as to time no one was like his first scholar in mr hales heart
he was depressed and sad at this partial cessation of an intercourse which had become dear to him and he used to sit pondering over the reason that could have occasioned this change
he startled margaret one evening as she sate at her work by suddenly asking  margaret
had you ever any reason for thinking that mr thornton cared for you  he almost blushed as he put this question but mr bells scouted idea recurred to him and the words were out of his mouth before he well knew what he was about
margaret did not answer immediately but by the bent drooping of her head he guessed what her reply would be
yes i believeoh papa i should have told you and she dropped her work and hid her face in her hands
no dear dont think that i am impertinently curious
i am sure you would have told me if you had felt that you could return his regard
did he speak to you about it  no answer at first but byandby a little gentle reluctant yes  and you refused him  a long sigh a more helpless nerveless attitude and another yes but before her father could speak margaret lifted up her face rosy with some beautiful shame and fixing her eyes upon him said  now papa i have told you all this and i cannot tell you more and then the whole thing is so painful to me every word and action connected with it is so unspeakably bitter that i cannot bear to think of it
oh papa i am sorry to have lost you this friend but i could not help itbut oh
i am very sorry she sate down on the ground and laid her head on his knees
i too am sorry my dear
mr bell quite startled me when he said some idea of the kind  mr
bell
oh did mr bell see it  a little but he took it into his head that youhow shall i say itthat you were not ungraciously disposed towards mr thornton
i knew that could never be
i hoped the whole thing was but an imagination but i knew too well what your real feelings were to suppose that you could ever like mr thornton in that way
but i am very sorry  they were very quiet and still for some minutes
but on stroking her cheek in a caressing way soon after he was almost shocked to find her face wet with tears
as he touched her she sprang up and smiling with forced brightness began to talk of the lennoxes with such a vehement desire to turn the conversation that mr hale was too tenderhearted to try to force it back into the old channel
tomorrowyes tomorrow they will be back in harley street
oh how strange it will be
i wonder what room they will make into the nursery
aunt shaw will be happy with the baby
fancy edith a mamma
and captain lennoxi wonder what he will do with himself now he has sold out  ill tell you what said her father anxious to indulge her in this fresh subject of interest i think i must spare you for a fortnight just to run up to town and see the travellers
you could learn more by half an hours conversation with mr henry lennox about fredericks chances than in a dozen of these letters of his so it would in fact be uniting business with pleasure  no papa you cannot spare me and whats more i wont be spared then after a pause she added i am losing hope sadly about frederick he is letting us down gently but i can see that mr lennox himself has no hope of hunting up the witnesses under years and years of time
no said she that bubble was very pretty and very dear to our hearts but it has burst like many another and we must console ourselves with being glad that frederick is so happy and with being a great deal to each other
so dont offend me by talking of being able to spare me papa for i assure you you cant  but the idea of a change took root and germinated in margarets heart although not in the way in which her father proposed it at first
she began to consider how desirable something of the kind would be to her father whose spirits always feeble now became too frequently depressed and whose health though he never complained had been seriously affected by his wifes illness and death
there were the regular hours of reading with his pupils but that all giving and no receiving could no longer be called companionship as in the old days when mr thornton came to study under him
margaret was conscious of the want under which he was suffering unknown to himself the want of a mans intercourse with men
at helstone there had been perpetual occasion for an interchange of visits with neighbouring clergymen and the poor labourers in the fields or leisurely tramping home at eve or tending their cattle in the forest were always at liberty to speak or be spoken to
but in milton every one was too busy for quiet speech or any ripened intercourse of thought what they said was about business very present and actual and when the tension of mind relating to their daily affairs was over they sunk into fallow rest until next morning
the workman was not to be found after the days work was done he had gone away to some lecture or some club or some beershop according to his degree of character
mr hale thought of trying to deliver a course of lectures at some of the institutions but he contemplated doing this so much as an effort of duty and with so little of the genial impulse of love towards his work and its end that margaret was sure that it would not be well done until he could look upon it with some kind of zest
the journeys end
i see my way as birds their trackless way     i shall arrive
what time what circuit first     i ask not but unless god sends his hail     or blinding fireballs sleet or stifling snow     in some timehis good timei shall arrive     he guides me and the bird
in his good time
brownings paracelsus
so the winter was getting on and the days were beginning to lengthen without bringing with them any of the brightness of hope which usually accompanies the rays of a february sun
mrs thornton had of course entirely ceased to come to the house
mr thornton came occasionally but his visits were addressed to her father and were confined to the study
mr hale spoke of him as always the same indeed the very rarity of their intercourse seemed to make mr hale set only the higher value on it
and from what margaret could gather of what mr thornton had said there was nothing in the cessation of his visits which could arise from any umbrage or vexation
his business affairs had become complicated during the strike and required closer attention than he had given to them last winter
nay margaret could even discover that he spoke from time to time of her and always as far as she could learn in the same calm friendly way never avoiding and never seeking any mention of her name
she was not in spirits to raise her fathers tone of mind
the dreary peacefulness of the present time had been preceded by so long a period of anxiety and careeven intermixed with stormsthat her mind had lost its elasticity
she tried to find herself occupation in teaching the two younger boucher children and worked hard at goodness hard i say most truly for her heart seemed dead to the end of all her efforts and though she made them punctually and painfully yet she stood as far off as ever from any cheerfulness her life seemed still bleak and dreary
the only thing she did well was what she did out of unconscious piety the silent comforting and consoling of her father
not a mood of his but what found a ready sympathiser in margaret not a wish of his that she did not strive to forecast and to fulfil
they were quiet wishes to be sure and hardly named without hesitation and apology
all the more complete and beautiful was her meek spirit of obedience
march brought the news of fredericks marriage
he and dolores wrote she in spanishenglish as was but natural and he with little turns and inversions of words which proved how far the idioms of his brides country were infecting him
on the receipt of henry lennoxs letter announcing how little hope there was of his ever clearing himself at a courtmartial in the absence of the missing witnesses frederick had written to margaret a pretty vehement letter containing his renunciation of england as his country he wished he could unnative himself and declared that he would not take his pardon if it were offered him nor live in the country if he had permission to do so
all of which made margaret cry sorely so unnatural did it seem to her at the first opening but on consideration she saw rather in such expression the poignancy of the disappointment which had thus crushed his hopes and she felt that there was nothing for it but patience
in the next letter frederick spoke so joyfully of the future that he had no thought for the past and margaret found a use in herself for the patience she had been craving for him
she would have to be patient
but the pretty timid girlish letters of dolores were beginning to have a charm for both margaret and her father
the young spaniard was so evidently anxious to make a favourable impression upon her lovers english relations that her feminine care peeped out at every erasure and the letters announcing the marriage were accompanied by a splendid black lace mantilla chosen by dolores herself for her unseen sisterinlaw whom frederick had represented as a paragon of beauty wisdom and virtue
fredericks worldly position was raised by this marriage on to as high a level as they could desire
barbour and co was one of the most extensive spanish houses and into it he was received as a junior partner
margaret smiled a little and then sighed as she remembered afresh her old tirades against trade
here was her preux chevalier of a brother turned merchant trader
but then she rebelled against herself and protested silently against the confusion implied between a spanish merchant and a milton millowner
well trade or no trade frederick was very very happy
dolores must be charming and the mantilla was exquisite
and then she returned to the present life
her father had occasionally experienced a difficulty in breathing this spring which had for the time distressed him exceedingly
margaret was less alarmed as this difficulty went off completely in the intervals but she still was so desirous of his shaking off the liability altogether as to make her very urgent that he should accept mr bells invitation to visit him at oxford this april
mr bells invitation included margaret
nay more he wrote a special letter commanding her to come but she felt as if it would be a greater relief to her to remain quietly at home entirely free from any responsibility whatever and so to rest her mind and heart in a manner which she had not been able to do for more than two years past
when her father had driven off on his way to the railroad margaret felt how great and long had been the pressure on her time and her spirits
it was astonishing almost stunning to feel herself so much at liberty no one depending on her for cheering care if not for positive happiness no invalid to plan and think for she might be idle and silent and forgetfuland what seemed worth more than all the other privilegesshe might be unhappy if she liked
for months past all her own personal cares and troubles had had to be stuffed away into a dark cupboard but now she had leisure to take them out and mourn over them and study their nature and seek the true method of subduing them into the elements of peace
all these weeks she had been conscious of their existence in a dull kind of way though they were hidden out of sight
now once for all she would consider them and appoint to each of them its right work in her life
so she sat almost motionless for hours in the drawingroom going over the bitterness of every remembrance with an unwincing resolution
only once she cried aloud at the stinging thought of the faithlessness which gave birth to that abasing falsehood
she now would not even acknowledge the force of the temptation her plans for frederick had all failed and the temptation lay there a dead mockerya mockery which had never had life in it the lie had been so despicably foolish seen by the light of the ensuing events and faith in the power of truth so infinitely the greater wisdom
in her nervous agitation she unconsciously opened a book of her fathers that lay upon the tablethe words that caught her eye in it seemed almost made for her present state of acute selfabasement       je ne voudrois pas reprendre mon cur en ceste sorte meurs de      honte aveugle impudent traistre et desloyal  ton dieu et      sembables choses mais je voudrois le corriger par voye de      compassion
or sus mon pauvre cur nous voil tombe dans la      fosse laquelle nous avions tant resolu deschapper
ah
revelonsnous et quittonsla pour jamais reclamons la misericorde      de dieu et esperons en elle quelle nous assistera pour desormais      estra plus fermes et remettonsnous au chemin de lhumilit
courage soyons meshuy sur nos gardes dieu nous aydera  the way of humility
ah thought margaret that is what i have missed
but courage little heart
we will turn back and by gods help we may find the lost path  so she rose up and determined at once to set to on some work which should take her out of herself
to begin with she called in martha as she passed the drawingroom door in going upstairs and tried to find out what was below the grave respectful servantlike manner which crusted over her individual character with an obedience which was almost mechanical
she found it difficult to induce martha to speak of any of her personal interests but at last she touched the right chord in naming mrs thornton
marthas whole face brightened and on a little encouragement out came a long story of how her father had been in early life connected with mrs thorntons husbandnay had even been in a position to show him some kindness what martha hardly knew for it had happened when she was quite a little child and circumstances had intervened to separate the two families until martha was nearly grown up when her father having sunk lower and lower from his original occupation as clerk in a warehouse and her mother being dead she and her sister to use marthas own expression would have been lost but for mrs thornton who sought them out and thought for them and cared for them
i had had the fever and was but delicate and mrs thornton and mr thornton too they never rested till they had nursed me up in their own house and sent me to the sea and all
the doctor said the fever was catching but they cared none for thatonly miss fanny and she went avisiting these folk that she is going to marry into
so though she was afraid at the time it has all ended well  miss fanny going to be married exclaimed margaret
yes and to a rich gentleman too only hes a deal older than she is
his name is watson and his mills are somewhere out beyond hayleigh its a very good marriage for all hes got such gray hair  at this piece of information margaret was silent long enough for martha to recover her propriety and with it her habitual shortness of answer
she swept up the hearth asked at what time she should prepare tea and quitted the room with the same wooden face with which she had entered it
margaret had to pull herself up from indulging a bad trick which she had lately fallen into of trying to imagine how every event that she heard of in relation to mr thornton would affect him whether he would like it or dislike it
the next day she had the little boucher children for their lessons and took a long walk and ended by a visit to mary higgins
somewhat to margarets surprise she found nicholas already come home from his work the lengthening light had deceived her as to the lateness of the evening
he too seemed by his manners to have entered a little more on the way of humility he was quieter and less selfasserting
so th oud gentlemans away on his travels is he said he
little uns telled me so
eh
but there sharp uns they are i amost think they beat my own wenches for sharpness though mappen its wrong to say so and one on em in her grave
theres summut in th weather i reckon as sets folk awandering
my measter him at th shop yonder is spinning about th world somewhere  is that the reason youre so soon at home tonight asked margaret innocently
thou knowst nought about it thats all said he contemptuously
im not one wi two facesone for my measter and tother for his back
i counted a th clocks in the town striking afore id leave my work
no
yon thorntons good enough for to fight wi but too good for to be cheated
it were you as getten me the place and i thank yo for it
thorntons is not a bad mill as times go
stand down lad and say yor pretty hymn to miss marget
thats right steady on thy legs and right arm out as straight as a skewer
one to stop two to stay three mak ready and four away  the little fellow repeated a methodist hymn far above his comprehension in point of language but of which the swinging rhythm had caught his ear and which he repeated with all the developed cadence of a member of parliament
when margaret had duly applauded nicholas called for another and yet another much to her surprise as she found him thus oddly and unconsciously led to take an interest in the sacred things which he had formerly scouted
it was past the usual teatime when she reached home but she had the comfort of feeling that no one had been kept waiting for her and of thinking her own thoughts while she rested instead of anxiously watching another person to learn whether to be grave or gay
after tea she resolved to examine a large packet of letters and pick out those that were to be destroyed
among them she came to four or five of mr henry lennoxs relating to fredericks affairs and she carefully read them over again with the sole intention when she began to ascertain exactly on how fine a chance the justification of her brother hung
but when she had finished the last and weighed the pros and cons the little personal revelation of character contained in them forced itself on her notice
it was evident enough from the stiffness of the wording that mr lennox had never forgotten his relation to her in any interest he might feel in the subject of the correspondence
they were clever letters margaret saw that in a twinkling but she missed out of them all hearty and genial atmosphere
they were to be preserved however as valuable so she laid them carefully on one side
when this little piece of business was ended she fell into a reverie and the thought of her absent father ran strangely in margarets head that night
she almost blamed herself for having felt her solitude and consequently his absence as a relief but these two days had set her up afresh with new strength and brighter hope
plans which had lately appeared to her in the guise of tasks now appeared like pleasures
the morbid scales had fallen from her eyes and she saw her position and her work more truly
if only mr thornton would restore her the lost friendshipnay if he would only come from time to time to cheer her father as in former daysthough she should never see him she felt as if the course of her future life though not brilliant in prospect might lie clear and even before her
she sighed as she rose up to go to bed
in spite of the one steps enough for mein spite of the one plain duty of devotion to her fatherthere lay at her heart an anxiety and a pang of sorrow
and mr hale thought of margaret that april evening just as strangely and as persistently as she was thinking of him
he had been fatigued by going about among his old friends and old familiar places
he had had exaggerated ideas of the change which his altered opinions might make in his friends reception of him but although some of them might have felt shocked or grieved or indignant at his falling off in the abstract as soon as they saw the face of the man whom they had once loved they forgot his opinions in himself or only remembered them enough to give an additional tender gravity to their manner
for mr hale had not been known to many he had belonged to one of the smaller colleges and had always been shy and reserved but those who in youth had cared to penetrate to the delicacy of thought and feeling that lay below his silence and indecision took him to their hearts with something of the protecting kindness which they would have shown to a woman
and the renewal of this kindliness after the lapse of years and an interval of so much change overpowered him more than any roughness or expression of disapproval could have done
im afraid weve done too much said mr bell
youre suffering now from having lived so long in that milton air  i am tired said mr hale
but it is not milton air
im fiftyfive years of age and that little fact of itself accounts for any loss of strength  nonsense
im upwards of sixty and feel no loss of strength either bodily or mental
dont let me hear you talking so
fiftyfive
why youre quite a young man  mr hale shook his head
these last few years said he
but after a minutes pause he raised himself from his half recumbent position in one of mr bells luxurious easychairs and said with a kind of trembling earnestness  bell
youre not to think that if i could have foreseen all that would come of my change of opinion and my resignation of my livingno
not even if i could have known how she would have sufferedthat i would undo itthe act of open acknowledgment that i no longer held the same faith as the church in which i was a priest
as i think now even if i could have foreseen that cruellest martyrdom of suffering through the sufferings of one whom i loved i would have done just the same as far as that step of openly leaving the church went
i might have done differently and acted more wisely in all that i subsequently did for my family
but i dont think god endued me with overmuch wisdom or strength he added falling back into his old position
mr bell blew his nose ostentatiously before answering
then he said  he gave you strength to do what your conscience told you was right and i dont see that we need any higher or holier strength than that or wisdom either
i know i have not that much and yet men set me down in their fools books as a wise man an independent character strongminded and all that cant
the veriest idiot who obeys his own simple law of right if it be but in wiping his shoes on a doormat is wiser and stronger than i
but what gulls men are  there was a pause
mr hale spoke first in continuation of his thought  about margaret  well
about margaret
what then  if i die  nonsense  what will become of heri often think
i suppose the lennoxes will ask her to live with them
i try to think they will
her aunt shaw loved her very well in her own quiet way but she forgets to love the absent  a very common fault
what sort of people are the lennoxes  he handsome fluent and agreeable
edith a sweet spoiled beauty
margaret loves her with all her heart and edith with as much of her heart as she can spare  now hale you know that girl of yours has got pretty nearly all my heart
i told you that before
of course as your daughter as my goddaughter i took great interest in her before i saw her the last time
but this visit that i paid to you at milton made me her slave
i went a willing old victim following the car of the conqueror
for indeed she looks as grand and serene as one who has struggled and may be struggling and yet has the victory secure in sight
yes in spite of all her present anxieties that was the look on her face
and so all i have is at her service if she needs it and will be hers whether she will or no when i die
moreover i myself will be her preux chevalier sixty and gouty though i be
seriously old friend your daughter shall be my principal charge in life and all the help that either my wit or my wisdom or my willing heart can give shall be hers
i dont choose her out as a subject for fretting
something i know of old you must have to worry yourself about or you wouldnt be happy
but youre going to outlive me by many a long year
you spare thin men are always tempting and always cheating death
its the stout florid fellows like me that always go off first  if mr bell had had a prophetic eye he might have seen the torch all but inverted and the angel with the grave and composed face standing very nigh beckoning to his friend
that night mr hale laid his head down upon the pillow on which it never more should stir with life
the servant who entered his room in the morning received no answer to his speech drew near the bed and saw the calm beautiful face lying white and cold under the ineffaceable seal of death
the attitude was exquisitely easy there had been no painno struggle
the action of the heart must have ceased as he lay down
mr bell was stunned by the shock and only recovered when the time came for being angry at every suggestion of his mans
a coroners inquest
pooh
you dont think i poisoned him
dr forbes says it is just the natural end of a heart complaint
poor old hale
you wore out that tender heart of yours before its time
poor old friend
how he talked of his wallis pack up a carpetbag for me in five minutes
here have i been talking
pack it up i say
i must go to milton by the next train  the bag was packed the cab ordered the railway reached in twenty minutes from the time of this decision
the london train whizzed by drew back some yards and in mr bell was hurried by the impatient guard
he threw himself back in his seat to try with closed eyes to understand how one in life yesterday could be dead today and shortly tears stole out between his grizzled eyelashes at the feeling of which he opened his keen eyes and looked as severely cheerful as his set determination could make him
he was not going to blubber before a set of strangers
not he
there was no set of strangers only one sitting far from him on the same side
byandby mr bell peered at him to discover what manner of man it was that might have been observing his emotion and behind the great sheet of the outspread times he recognized mr thornton
why thornton
is that you said he removing hastily to a closer proximity
he shook mr thornton vehemently by the hand until the gripe ended in a sudden relaxation for the hand was wanted to wipe away tears
he had last seen mr thornton in his friend hales company
im going to milton bound on a melancholy errand
going to break to hales daughter the news of his sudden death  death
mr hale dead  ay i keep saying it to myself hale is dead but it doesnt make it any the more real
hale is dead for all that
he went to bed well to all appearance last night and was quite cold this morning when my servant went to call him  where
i dont understand  at oxford
he came to stay with me hadnt been in oxford this seventeen yearsand this is the end of it  not one word was spoken for above a quarter of an hour
then mr thornton said  and she and stopped full short
margaret you mean
yes
i am going to tell her
poor fellow
how full his thoughts were of her all last night
good god
last night only
and how immeasurably distant he is now
but i take margaret as my child for his sake
i said last night i would take her for her own sake
well i take her for both  mr thornton made one or two fruitless attempts to speak before he could get out the words  what will become of her  i rather fancy there will be two people waiting for her myself for one
i would take a live dragon into my house to live if by hiring such a chaperon and setting up an establishment of my own i could make my old age happy with having margaret for a daughter
but there are those lennoxes  who are they asked mr thornton with trembling interest
oh smart london people who very likely will think that theyve the best right to her
captain lennox married her cousinthe girl she was brought up with
good enough people i dare say
and theres her aunt mrs shaw
there might be a way open perhaps by my offering to marry that worthy lady
but that would be quite a pis aller
and then theres that brother  what brother
a brother of her aunts  no no a clever lennox the captains a fool you must understand a young barrister who will be setting his cap at margaret
i know he has had her in his mind these five years or more one of his chums told me as much and he was only kept back by want of fortune
now that will be done away with  how asked mr thornton too earnestly curious to be aware of the impertinence of his question
why shell have my money at my death
and if this henry lennox is half good enough for her and she likes himwell
i might find another way of getting a home through a marriage
im dreadfully afraid of being tempted at an unguarded moment by her aunt  neither mr bell nor mr thornton was in a laughing humour so the oddity of any of the speeches which the former made was unnoticed by them
mr bell whistled without emitting any sound beyond a long hissing breath changed his seat without finding comfort or rest while mr thornton sat immovably still his eyes fixed on one spot in the newspaper which he had taken up in order to give himself leisure to think
where have you been asked mr bell at length
to havre
trying to detect the secret of the great rise in the price of cotton  ugh
cotton and speculations and smoke wellcleansed and wellcaredfor machinery and unwashed and neglected hands
poor old hale
poor old hale
if you could have known the change which it was to him from helstone
do you know the new forest at all  yes very shortly
then you can fancy the difference between it and milton
what part were you in
were you ever at helstone
a little picturesque village like some in the odenwald
you know helstone  i have seen it
it was a great change to leave it and come to milton  he took up his newspaper with a determined air as if resolved to avoid further conversation and mr bell was fain to resort to his former occupation of trying to find out how he could best break the news to margaret
she was at an upstairs window she saw him alight she guessed the truth with an instinctive flash
she stood in the middle of the drawingroom as if arrested in her first impulse to rush downstairs and as if by the same restraining thought she had been turned to stone so white and immovable was she
oh
dont tell me
i know it from your face
you would have sentyou would not have left himif he were alive
oh papa papa      alone
alone
when some beloved voice that was to you     both sound and sweetness faileth suddenly     and silence against which you dare not cry     aches round you like a strong disease and new     what hope
what help
what music will undo     that silence to your sense               mrs browning
the shock had been great
margaret fell into a state of prostration which did not show itself in sobs and tears or even find the relief of words
she lay on the sofa with her eyes shut never speaking but when spoken to and then replying in whispers
mr bell was perplexed
he dared not leave her he dared not ask her to accompany him back to oxford which had been one of the plans he had formed on the journey to milton her physical exhaustion was evidently too complete for her to undertake any such fatigueputting the sight that she would have to encounter out of the question
mr bell sate over the fire considering what he had better do
margaret lay motionless and almost breathless by him
he would not leave her even for the dinner which dixon had prepared for him downstairs and with sobbing hospitality would fain have tempted him to eat
he had a plateful of something brought up to him
in general he was particular and dainty enough and knew well each shade of flavour in his food but now the devilled chicken tasted like sawdust
he minced up some of the fowl for margaret and peppered and salted it well but when dixon following his directions tried to feed her the languid shake of head proved that in such a state as margaret was in food would only choke not nourish her
mr bell gave a great sigh lifted up his stout old limbs stiff with travelling from their easy position and followed dixon out of the room
i cant leave her
i must write to them at oxford to see that the preparations are made they can be getting on with these till i arrive
cant mrs lennox come to her
ill write and tell her she must
the girl must have some womanfriend about her if only to talk her into a good fit of crying  dixon was cryingenough for two but after wiping her eyes and steadying her voice she managed to tell mr bell that mrs lennox was too near her confinement to be able to undertake any journey at present
well
i suppose we must have mrs shaw shes come back to england isnt she  yes sir shes come back but i dont think she will like to leave mrs lennox at such an interesting time said dixon who did not much approve of a stranger entering the household to share with her in her ruling care of margaret
interesting time be mr bell restricted himself by coughing over the end of his sentence
she could be content to be at venice or naples or some of those popish places at the last interesting time which took place in corfu i think
and what does that little prosperous womans interesting time signify in comparison with that poor creature therethat helpless homeless friendless margaretlying as still on that sofa as if it were an altartomb and she the stone statue on it
i tell you mrs shaw shall come
see that a room or whatever she wants is got ready for her by tomorrow night
ill take care she comes  accordingly mr bell wrote a letter which mrs shaw declared with many tears to be so like one of the dear generals when he was going to have a fit of the gout that she should always value and preserve it
if he had given her the option by requesting or urging her as if a refusal were possible she might not have cometrue and sincere as was her sympathy with margaret
it needed the sharp uncourteous command to make her conquer her vis inerti and allow herself to be packed by her maid after the latter had completed the boxes
edith all cap shawl and tears came out to the top of the stairs as captain lennox was taking her mother down to the carriage  dont forget mamma margaret must come and live with us
sholto will go to oxford on wednesday and you must send word by mr bell to him when were to expect you
and if you want sholto he can go on from oxford to milton
dont forget mamma you are to bring back margaret  edith reentered the drawingroom
mr henry lennox was there cutting open the pages of a new review
without lifting his head he said if you dont like sholto to be so long absent from you edith i hope you will let me go down to milton and give what assistance i can  oh thank you said edith i dare say old mr bell will do everything he can and more help may not be needed
only one does not look for much savoirfaire from a resident fellow
dear darling margaret wont it be nice to have her here again
you were both great allies years ago  were we asked he indifferently with an appearance of being interested in a passage in the review
well perhaps noti forget
i was so full of sholto
but doesnt it fall out well that if my uncle was to die it should be just now when we are come home and settled in the old house and quite ready to receive margaret
poor thing
what a change it will be to her from milton
ill have new chintz for her bedroom and make it look new and bright and cheer her up a little  in the same spirit of kindness mrs shaw journeyed to milton occasionally dreading the first meeting and wondering how it would be got over but more frequently planning how soon she could get margaret away from that horrid place and back in the pleasant comforts of harley street
oh dear she said to her maid look at those chimneys
my poor sister hale
i dont think i could have rested at naples if i had known what it was
i must have come and fetched her and margaret away and to herself she acknowledged that she had always thought her brotherinlaw rather a weak man but never so weak as now when she saw for what a place he had exchanged the lovely helstone home
margaret had remained in the same state white motionless speechless tearless
they had told her that her aunt shaw was coming but she had not expressed either surprise or pleasure or dislike to the idea
mr bell whose appetite had returned and who appreciated dixons endeavours to gratify it in vain urged upon her to taste some sweetbreads stewed with oysters she shook her head with the same quiet obstinacy as on the previous day and he was obliged to console himself for her rejection by eating them all himself
but margaret was the first to hear the stopping of the cab that brought her aunt from the railway station
her eyelids quivered her lips coloured and trembled
mr bell went down to meet mrs shaw and when they came up margaret was standing trying to steady her dizzy self and when she saw her aunt she went forward to the arms open to receive her and first found the passionate relief of tears on her aunts shoulder
all thoughts of quiet habitual love of tenderness for years of relationship to the dead all that inexplicable likeness in look tone and gesture that seem to belong to one family and which reminded margaret so forcibly at this moment of her mother came in to melt and soften her numbed heart into the overflow of warm tears
mr bell stole out of the room and went down into the study where he ordered a fire and tried to divert his thoughts by taking down and examining the different books
each volume brought a remembrance or a suggestion of his dead friend
it might be a change of employment from his two days work of watching margaret but it was no change of thought
he was glad to catch the sound of mr thorntons voice making enquiry at the door
dixon was rather cavalierly dismissing him for with the appearance of mrs shaws maid came visions of former grandeur of the beresford blood of the station so she was pleased to term it from which her young lady had been ousted and to which she was now please god to be restored
these visions which she had been dwelling on with complacency in her conversation with mrs shaws maid skilfully eliciting meanwhile all the circumstances of state and consequence connected with the harley street establishment for the edification of the listening martha made dixon rather inclined to be supercilious in her treatment of any inhabitant of milton so though she always stood rather in awe of mr thornton she was as curt as she durst be in telling him that he could see none of the inmates of the house that night
it was rather uncomfortable to be contradicted in her statement by mr bells opening the studydoor and calling out  thornton
is that you
come in for a minute or two i want to speak to you so mr thornton went into the study and dixon had to retreat into the kitchen and reinstate herself in her own esteem by a prodigious story of sir john beresfords coach and six when he was high sheriff
i dont know what i wanted to say to you after all
only its dull enough to sit in a room where everything speaks to you of a dead friend
yet margaret and her aunt must have the drawingroom to themselves  is mrsis her aunt come asked mr thornton
come
yes
maid and all
one would have thought she might have come by herself at such a time
and now i shall have to turn out and find my way to the clarendon  you must not go to the clarendon
we have five or six empty bedrooms at home  well aired  i think you may trust my mother for that  then ill only run upstairs and wish that wan girl goodnight and make my bow to her aunt and go off with you straight  mr bell was some time upstairs
mr thornton began to think it long for he was full of business and had hardly been able to spare the time for running up to crampton and enquiring how miss hale was
when they had set out upon their walk mr bell said  i was kept by those women in the drawingroom
mrs shaw is anxious to get homeon account of her daughter she saysand wants margaret to go off with her at once
now she is no more fit for travelling than i am for flying
besides she says and very justly that she has friends she must seethat she must wish goodbye to several people and then her aunt worried her about old claims and was she forgetful of old friends
and she said with a great burst of crying she should be glad enough to go from a place where she had suffered so much
now i must return to oxford tomorrow and i dont know on which side of the scale to throw in my voice  he paused as if asking a question but he received no answer from his companion the echo of whose thoughts kept repeating  where she had suffered so much alas
and that was the way in which this eighteen months in miltonto him so unspeakably precious down to its very bitterness which was worth all the rest of lifes sweetnesswould be remembered
neither loss of father nor loss of mother dear as she was to mr thornton could have poisoned the remembrance of the weeks the days the hours when a walk of two miles every step of which was pleasant as it brought him nearer and nearer to her took him to her sweet presenceevery step of which was rich as each recurring moment that bore him away from her made him recall some fresh grace in her demeanour or pleasant pungency in her character
yes
whatever had happened to him external to his relation to her he could never have spoken of that time when he could have seen her every daywhen he had her within his grasp as it wereas a time of suffering
it had been a royal time of luxury to him with all its stings and contumelies compared to the poverty that crept round and clipped the anticipation of the future down to sordid fact and life without an atmosphere of either hope or fear
mrs thornton and fanny were in the diningroom the latter in a flutter of small exultation as the maid held up one glossy material after another to try the effect of the weddingdresses by candlelight
her mother really tried to sympathise with her but could not
neither taste nor dress were in her line of subjects and she heartily wished that fanny had accepted her brothers offer of having the wedding clothes provided by some firstrate london dressmaker without the endless troublesome discussions and unsettled waverings that arose out of fannys desire to choose and superintend everything herself
mr thornton was only too glad to mark his grateful approbation of any sensible man who could be captivated by fannys secondrate airs and graces by giving her ample means for providing herself with the finery which certainly rivalled if it did not exceed the lover in her estimation
when her brother and mr bell came in fanny blushed and simpered and fluttered over the signs of her employment in a way which could not have failed to draw attention from any one else but mr bell
if he thought about her and her silks and satins at all it was to compare her and them with the pale sorrow he had left behind him sitting motionless with bent head and folded hands in a room where the stillness was so great that you might almost fancy the rush in your straining ears was occasioned by the spirits of the dead yet hovering round their beloved
for when mr bell had first gone upstairs mrs shaw lay asleep on the sofa and no sound broke the silence
mrs thornton gave mr bell her formal hospitable welcome
she was never so gracious as when receiving her sons friends in her sons house and the more unexpected they were the more honour to her admirable housekeeping preparations for comfort
how is miss hale she asked
about as broken down by this last stroke as she can be  i am sure it is very well for her that she has such a friend as you  i wish i were her only friend madam
i daresay it sounds very brutal but here have i been displaced and turned out of my post of comforter and adviser by a fine lady aunt and there are cousins and what not claiming her in london as if she were a lapdog belonging to them
and she is too weak and miserable to have a will of her own  she must indeed be weak said mrs thornton with an implied meaning which her son understood well
but where continued mrs thornton have these relations been all this time that miss hale has appeared almost friendless and has certainly had a good deal of anxiety to bear but she did not feel interest enough in the answer to her question to wait for it
she left the room to make her household arrangements
they have been living abroad
they have some kind of claim upon her
i will do them that justice
the aunt brought her up and she and the cousin have been like sisters
the thing vexing me you see is that i wanted to take her for a child of my own and i am jealous of these people who dont seem to value the privilege of their right
now it would be different if frederick claimed her  frederick exclaimed mr thornton
who is he
what right he stopped short in his vehement question
frederick said mr bell in surprise
why dont you know
hes her brother
have you not heard  i never heard his name before
where is he
who is he  surely i told you about him when the family first came to miltonthe son who was concerned in that mutiny  i never heard of him till this moment
where does he live  in spain
hes liable to be arrested the moment he sets foot on english ground
poor fellow
he will grieve at not being able to attend his fathers funeral
we must be content with captain lennox for i dont know of any other relation  i hope i may be allowed to go  certainly thankfully
youre a good fellow after all thornton
hale liked you
he spoke to me only the other day at oxford
he regretted he had seen so little of you lately
i am obliged to you for wishing to show him respect  but about frederick
does he never come to england  never  he was not over here about the time of mrs hales death  no
why i was here then
i hadnt seen hale for years and years and if you remember i cameno it was some time after that that i came
but poor frederick hale was not here then
what made you think he was  i saw a young man walking with miss hale one day replied mr thornton and i think it was about that time  oh that would be this young lennox the captains brother
hes a lawyer and they were in pretty constant correspondence with him and i remember mr hale told me he thought he would come down
do you know said mr bell wheeling round and shutting one eye the better to bring the forces of the other to bear with keen scrutiny on mr thorntons face that i once fancied you had a little tenderness for margaret  no answer
no change of countenance
and so did poor hale
not at first and not till i had put it into his head  i admired miss hale
every one must do so
she is a beautiful creature said mr thornton driven to bay by mr bells pertinacious questioning
is that all
you can speak of her in that measured way as simply a beautiful creatureonly something to catch the eye
i did hope you had had nobleness enough in you to make you pay her the homage of the heart
though i believein fact i know she would have rejected you still to have loved her without return would have lifted you higher than all those be they who they may that have ever known her to love
beautiful creature indeed
do you speak of her as you would of a horse or a dog  mr thorntons eyes glowed like red embers
mr
bell said he before you speak so you should remember that all men are not as free to express what they feel as you are
let us talk of something else for though his heart leaped up as at a trumpetcall to every word that mr bell had said and though he knew that what he had said would henceforward bind the thought of the old oxford fellow closely up with the most precious things of his heart yet he would not be forced into any expression of what he felt towards margaret
he was no mockingbird of praise to try because another extolled what he reverenced and passionately loved to outdo him in laudation
so he turned to some of the dry matters of business that lay between mr bell and him as landlord and tenant
what is that heap of brick and mortar we came against in the yard
any repairs wanted  no none thank you  are you building on your own account
if you are im very much obliged to you  im building a diningroomfor the men i meanthe hands  i thought you were hard to please if this room wasnt good enough to satisfy you a bachelor  ive got acquainted with a strange kind of chap and i put one or two children in whom he is interested to school
so as i happened to be passing near his house one day i just went there about some trifling payment to be made and i saw such a miserable black frizzle of a dinnera greasy cinder of meat as first set me athinking
but it was not till provisions grew so high this winter that i bethought me how by buying things wholesale and cooking a good quantity of provisions together much money might be saved and much comfort gained
so i spoke to my friendor my enemythe man i told you ofand he found fault with every detail of my plan and in consequence i laid it aside both as impracticable and also because if i forced it into operation i should be interfering with the independence of my men when suddenly this higgins came to me and graciously signified his approval of a scheme so nearly the same as mine that i might fairly have claimed it and moreover the approval of several of his fellowworkmen to whom he had spoken
i was a little riled i confess by his manner and thought of throwing the whole thing overboard to sink or swim
but it seemed childish to relinquish a plan which i had once thought wise and welllaid just because i myself did not receive all the honour and consequence due to the originator
so i coolly took the part assigned to me which is something like that of a steward to a club
i buy in the provisions wholesale and provide a fitting matron or cook  i hope you give satisfaction in your new capacity
are you a good judge of potatoes and onions
but i suppose mrs thornton assists you in your marketing  not a bit replied mr thornton
she disapproves of the whole plan and now we never mention it to each other
but i manage pretty well getting in great stocks from liverpool and being served in butchers meat by our own family butcher
i can assure you the hot dinners the matron turns out are not to be despised  do you taste each dish as it goes in in virtue of your office
i hope you have a white wand  i was very scrupulous at first in confining myself to the mere purchasing part and even in that i rather obeyed the mens orders conveyed through the housekeeper than went by my own judgment
at one time the beef was too large at another the mutton was not fat enough
i think they saw how careful i was to leave them free and not to intrude my own ideas upon them so one day two or three of the menmy friend higgins among themasked me if i would not come in and take a snack
it was a very busy day but i saw that the men would be hurt if after making the advance i didnt meet them halfway so i went in and i never made a better dinner in my life
i told them my next neighbours i mean for im no speechmaker how much i enjoyed it and for some time whenever that especial dinner recurred in their dietary i was sure to be met by these men with a master theres hotpot for dinner today win yo come in if they had not asked me i would no more have intruded on them than id have gone to the mess at the barracks without invitation  i should think you were rather a restraint on your hosts conversation
they cant abuse the masters while youre there
i expect they take it out on nonhotpot days  well
hitherto weve steered clear of all vexed questions
but if any of the old disputes came up again i would certainly speak out my mind next hotpot day
but you are hardly acquainted with our darkshire fellows for all youre a darkshire man yourself
they have such a sense of humour and such a racy mode of expression
i am getting really to know some of them now and they talk pretty freely before me  nothing like the act of eating for equalising men
dying is nothing to it
the philosopher dies sententiouslythe pharisee ostentatiouslythe simplehearted humblythe poor idiot blindly as the sparrow falls to the ground the philosopher and idiot publican and pharisee all eat after the same fashiongiven an equally good digestion
theres theory for theory for you  indeed i have no theory i hate theories  i beg your pardon
to show my penitence will you accept a ten pound note towards your marketing and give the poor fellows a feast  thank you but id rather not
they pay me rent for the oven and cookingplaces at the back of the mill and will have to pay more for the new diningroom
i dont want it to fall into a charity
i dont want donations
once let in the principle and i should have people going and talking and spoiling the simplicity of the whole thing  people will talk about any new plan
you cant help that  my enemies if i have any may make a philanthropic fuss about this dinnerscheme but you are a friend and i expect that you will now pay my experiment the respect of silence
it is but a new broom at present and sweeps clean enough
but byanbye we shall meet with plenty of stumblingblocks no doubt      margarets flittin
the meanest thing to which we bid adieu     loses its meanness in the parting hour               elliott
mrs shaw took as vehement a dislike as it was possible for one of her gentle nature to do against milton
it was noisy and smoky and the poor people whom she saw in the streets were dirty and the rich ladies overdressed and not a man that she saw high or low had his clothes made to fit him
she was sure margaret would never regain her lost strength while she stayed in milton and she herself was afraid of one of her old attacks of the nerves
margaret must return with her and that quickly
this if not the exact force of her words was at any rate the spirit of what she urged on margaret till the latter weak weary and brokenspirited yielded a reluctant promise that as soon as wednesday was over she would prepare to accompany her aunt back to town leaving dixon in charge of all the arrangements for paying bills disposing of furniture and shutting up the house
before that wednesdaythat mournful wednesday when mr hale was to be interred far away from either of the homes he had known in life and far away from the wife who lay lonely among strangers and this last was margarets great trouble for she thought that if she had not given way to that overwhelming stupor during the first sad days she could have arranged things otherwisebefore that wednesday margaret received a letter from mr bell
my dear margareti did mean to have returned to milton on      thursday but unluckily it turns out to be one of the rare      occasions when we plymouth fellows are called upon to perform any      kind of duty and i must not be absent from my post
captain lennox      and mr thornton are here
the former seems a smart wellmeaning      man and has proposed to go over to milton and assist you in any      search for the will of course there is none or you would have      found it by this time if you followed my directions
then the      captain declares he must take you and his motherinlaw home and      in his wifes present state i dont see how you can expect him to      remain away longer than friday
however that dixon of yours is      trusty and can hold her or your own till i come
i will put      matters into the hands of my milton attorney if there is no will      for i doubt this smart captain is no great man of business
nevertheless his moustachios are splendid
there will have to be a      sale so select what things you wish to be reserved
or you can      send a list afterwards
now two things more and i have done
you      know or if you dont your poor father did that you are to have      my money and goods when i die
not that i mean to die yet but i      name this just to explain what is coming
these lennoxes seem very      fond of you now and perhaps may continue to be perhaps not
so it      is best to start with a formal agreement namely that you are to      pay to them two hundred and fifty pounds a year as long as you and      they find it pleasant to live together
this of course includes      dixon mind you dont be cajoled into paying more for her
then      you wont be thrown adrift if some day the captain wishes to have      his house to himself but you can carry yourself and your two      hundred and fifty pounds off somewhere else if indeed i have      not claimed you to come and keep house for me first
then as to      dress and dixon and personal expenses and confectionery all      young ladies eat confectionery till wisdom comes by age i shall      consult some lady of my acquaintance and see how much you will      have from your father before fixing this
now margaret have you      flown out before you have read this far and wondered what right      the old man has to settle your affairs for you so cavalierly
i      make no doubt you have
yet the old man has a right
he has loved      your father for five and thirty years he stood beside him on his      weddingday he closed his eyes in death
moreover he is your      godfather and as he cannot do you much good spiritually having a      hidden consciousness of your superiority in such things he would      fain do you the poor good of endowing you materially
and the old      man has not a known relation on earth who is there to mourn for      adam bell and his whole heart is set and bent upon this one      thing and margaret hale is not the girl to say him nay
write by      return if only two lines to tell me your answer
but no thanks  margaret took up a pen and scrawled with trembling hand margaret hale is not the girl to say him nay in her weak state she could not think of any other words and yet she was vexed to use these
but she was so much fatigued even by this slight exertion that if she could have thought of another form of acceptance she could not have sate up to write a syllable of it
she was obliged to lie down again and try not to think
my dearest child
has that letter vexed or troubled you  no said margaret feebly
i shall be better when tomorrow is over  i feel sure darling you wont be better till i get you out of this horrid air
how you can have borne it these two years i cant imagine  where could i go to
i could not leave papa and mamma  well dont distress yourself my dear
i dare say it was all for the best only i had no conception of how you were living
our butlers wife lives in a better house than this  it is sometimes very prettyin summer you cant judge by what it is now
i have been very happy here and margaret closed her eyes by way of stopping the conversation
the house teemed with comfort now compared to what it had been
the evenings were chilly and by mrs shaws directions fires were lighted in every bedroom
she petted margaret in every possible way and bought every delicacy or soft luxury in which she herself would have burrowed and sought comfort
but margaret was indifferent to all these things or if they forced themselves upon her attention it was simply as causes for gratitude to her aunt who was putting herself so much out of the way to think of her
she was restless though so weak
all the day long she kept herself from thinking of the ceremony which was going on at oxford by wandering from room to room and languidly setting aside such articles as she wished to retain
dixon followed her by mrs shaws desire ostensibly to receive instructions but with a private injunction to soothe her into repose as soon as might be
these books dixon i will keep
all the rest will you send to mr bell
they are of a kind that he will value for themselves as well as for papas sake
this i should like you to take this to mr thornton after i am gone
stay i will write a note with it and she sate down hastily as if afraid of thinking and wrote       dear sirthe accompanying book i am sure will be valued by you      for the sake of my father to whom it belonged
yours sincerely                                                          margaret hale    she set out again upon her travels through the house turning over articles known to her from her childhood with a sort of caressing reluctance to leave themoldfashioned worn and shabby as they might be
but she hardly spoke again and dixons report to mrs shaw was that she doubted whether miss hale heard a word of what she said though she talked the whole time in order to divert her intention the consequence of her being on her feet all day was excessive bodily weariness in the evening and a better nights rest than she had had since she heard of mr hales death
at breakfast time the next day she expressed her wish to go and bid one or two friends goodbye
mrs shaw objected  i am sure my dear you can have no friends here with whom you are sufficiently intimate to justify you in calling upon them so soon before you have been at church  but today is my only day if captain lennox comes this after noon and if we mustif i must really go tomorrow  oh yes we shall go tomorrow
i am more and more convinced that this air is bad for you and makes you look so pale and ill besides edith expects us and she may be waiting for me and you cannot be left alone my dear at your age
no if you must make these calls i will go with you
dixon can get us a coach i suppose  so mrs shaw went to take care of margaret and took her maid with her to take care of the shawls and aircushions
margarets face was too sad to lighten up into a smile at all this preparation for paying two visits that she had often made by herself at all hours of the day
she was half afraid of owning that one place to which she was going was nicholas higgins all she could do was to hope her aunt would be indisposed to get out of the coach and walk up the court and at every breath of wind have her face slapped by wet clothes hanging out to dry on ropes stretched from house to house
there was a little battle in mrs shaws mind between ease and a sense of matronly propriety but the former gained the day and with many an injunction to margaret to be careful of herself and not to catch any fever such as was always lurking in such places her aunt permitted her to go where she had often been before without taking any precaution or requiring any permission
nicholas was out only mary and one or two of the boucher children at home
margaret was vexed with herself for not having timed her visit better
mary had a very blunt intellect although her feelings were warm and kind and the instant she understood what margarets purpose was in coming to see them she began to cry and sob with so little restraint that margaret found it useless to say any of the thousand little things which had suggested themselves to her as she was coming along in the coach
she could only try to comfort her a little by suggesting the vague chance of their meeting again at some possible time in some possible place and bid her tell her father how much she wished if he could manage it that he should come to see her when he had done his work in the evening
as she was leaving the place she stopped and looked around then hesitated a little before she said  i should like to have some little thing to remind me of bessy  instantly marys generosity was keenly alive
what could they give
and on margarets singling out a little common drinkingcup which she remembered as the one always standing by bessys side with a drink for her feverish lips mary said  oh take summat better that only cost fourpence  that will do thank you said margaret and she went quickly away while the light caused by the pleasure of having something to give yet lingered on marys face
now to mrs thorntons thought she to herself
it must be done but she looked rather rigid and pale at the thoughts of it and had hard work to find the exact words in which to explain to her aunt who mrs thornton was and why she should go to bid her farewell
they for mrs shaw alighted here were shown into the drawingroom in which a fire had only just been kindled
mrs shaw huddled herself up in her shawl and shivered
what an icy room she said
they had to wait for some time before mrs thornton entered
there was some softening in her heart towards margaret now that she was going away out of her sight
she remembered her spirit as shown at various times and places even more than the patience with which she had endured long and wearing cares
her countenance was blander than usual as she greeted her there was even a shade of tenderness in her manner as she noticed the white tearswollen face and the quiver in the voice which margaret tried to make so steady
allow me to introduce my aunt mrs shaw
i am going away from milton tomorrow i do not know if you are aware of it but i wanted to see you once again mrs thornton toto apologize for my manner the last time i saw you and to say that i am sure you meant kindlyhowever much we may have misunderstood each other  mrs shaw looked extremely perplexed by what margaret had said
thanks for kindness
and apologies for failure in good manners
but mrs thornton replied  miss hale i am glad you do me justice
i did no more than i believed to be my duty in remonstrating with you as i did
i have always desired to act the part of a friend to you
i am glad you do me justice  and said margaret blushing excessively as she spoke will you do me justice and believe that though i cannoti do not chooseto give explanations of my conduct i have not acted in the unbecoming way you apprehended  margarets voice was so soft and her eyes so pleading that mrs thornton was for once affected by the charm of manner to which she had hitherto proved herself invulnerable
yes i do believe you
let us say no more about it
where are you going to reside miss hale
i understood from mr bell that you were going to leave milton
you never liked milton you know said mrs thornton with a sort of grim smile but for all that you must not expect me to congratulate you on quitting it
where shall you live  with my aunt replied margaret turning towards mrs shaw
my niece will reside with me in harley street
she is almost like a daughter to me said mrs shaw looking fondly at margaret and i am glad to acknowledge my own obligation for any kindness that has been shown to her
if you and your husband ever come to the town my son and daughter captain and mrs lennox will i am sure join with me in wishing to do anything in our power to show you attention  mrs thornton thought in her own mind that margaret had not taken much care to enlighten her aunt as to the relationship between the mr and mrs thornton towards whom the finelady aunt was extending her soft patronage so she answered shortly  my husband is dead
mr thornton is my son
i never go to london so i am not likely to be able to avail myself of your polite offers  at this instant mr thornton entered the room he had only just returned from oxford
his mourning suit spoke of the reason that had called him there
john said his mother this lady is mrs shaw miss hales aunt
i am sorry to say that miss hales call is to wish us goodbye  you are going then said he in a low voice
yes said margaret
we leave tomorrow  my soninlaw comes this evening to escort us said mrs shaw
mr thornton turned away
he had not sat down and now he seemed to be examining something on the table almost as if he had discovered an unopened letter which had made him forget the present company
he did not even seem to be aware when they got up to take leave
he started forwards however to hand mrs shaw down to the carriage
as it drove up he and margaret stood close together on the doorstep and it was impossible but that the recollection of the day of the riot should force itself into both their minds
into his it came associated with the speeches of the following day her passionate declaration that there was not a man in all that violent and a desperate crowd for whom she did not care as much as for him
and at the remembrance of her taunting words his brow grew stern though his heart beat thick with longing love
no said he i put it to the touch once and i lost it all
let her gowith her stony heart and her beautyhow set and terrible her look is now for all her loveliness of feature
she is afraid i shall speak what will require some stern repression
let her go
beauty and heiress as she may be she will find it hard to meet with a truer heart than mine
let her go  and there was no tone of regret or emotion of any kind in the voice with which he said goodbye and the offered hand was taken with a resolute calmness and dropped as carelessly as if it had been a dead and withered flower
but none in his household saw mr thornton again that day
he was busily engaged or so he said
margarets strength was so utterly exhausted by these visits that she had to submit to much watching and petting and sighing itoldyousos from her aunt
dixon said she was quite as bad as she had been on the first day she heard of her fathers death and she and mrs shaw consulted as to the desirableness of delaying the morrows journey
but when her aunt reluctantly proposed a few days delay to margaret the latter writhed her body as if in acute suffering and said  oh
let us go
i cannot be patient here
i shall not get well here
i want to forget  so the arrangements went on and captain lennox came and with him news of edith and the little boy and margaret found that the indifferent careless conversation of one who however kind was not too warm and anxious a sympathiser did her good
she roused up and by the time that she knew she might expect higgins she was able to leave the room quietly and await in her own chamber the expected summons
eh said he as she came in to think of th oud gentleman dropping off as he did
yo might ha knocked me down wi a straw when they telled me
mr
hale said i him as was th parson ay said they
then said i theres as good a man gone as ever lived on this earth let who will be tother and i came to see yo and tell yo how grieved i were but them women in th kitchen wouldnt tell yo i were there

i would not give you one penny she said smiling dont think theres any of it for you  well wench
i can nobbut say bless yo
and bless yoand amen      ease not peace
a dull rotation never at a stay      yesterdays face twin image of today                      cowper
of what each one should be he sees the form and rule      and till he reach to that his joy can neer be full                     ruckert
it was very well for margaret that the extreme quiet of the harley street house during ediths recovery from her confinement gave her the natural rest which she needed
it gave her time to comprehend the sudden change which had taken place in her circumstances within the last two months
she found herself at once an inmate of a luxurious house where the bare knowledge of the existence of every trouble or care seemed scarcely to have penetrated
the wheels of the machinery of daily life were well oiled and went along with delicious smoothness
mrs shaw and edith could hardly make enough of margaret on her return to what they persisted in calling her home
and she felt that it was almost ungrateful in her to have a secret feeling that the helstone vicaragenay even the poor little house at milton with her anxious father and her invalid mother and all the small household cares of comparative poverty composed her idea of home
edith was impatient to get well in order to fill margarets bedroom with all the soft comforts and pretty knickknacks with which her own abounded
mrs shaw and her maid found plenty of occupation in restoring margarets wardrobe to a state of elegant variety
captain lennox was easy kind and gentlemanly sate with his wife in her dressingroom an hour or two every day played with his little boy for another hour and lounged away the rest of his time at his club when he was not engaged out to dinner
just before margaret had recovered from her necessity for quiet and reposebefore she had begun to feel her life wanting and dulledith came downstairs and resumed her usual part in the household and margaret fell into the old habit of watching and admiring and ministering to her cousin
she gladly took all charge of the semblances of duties off ediths hands answered notes reminded her of engagements tended her when no gaiety was in prospect and she was consequently rather inclined to fancy herself ill
but all the rest of the family were in the full business of the london season and margaret was often left alone
then her thoughts went back to milton with a strange sense of the contrast between the life there and here
she was getting surfeited of the eventless ease in which no struggle or endeavour was required
she was afraid lest she should even become sleepily deadened into forgetfulness of anything beyond the life which was lapping her round with luxury
there might be toilers and moilers there in london but she never saw them the very servants lived in an underground world of their own of which she knew neither the hopes nor the fears they only seemed to start into existence when some want or whim of their master and mistress needed them
there was a strange unsatisfied vacuum in margarets heart and mode of life and once when she had dimly hinted this to edith the latter wearied with dancing the night before languidly stroked margarets cheek as she sat by her in the old attitudeshe on a footstool by the sofa where edith lay
poor child said edith
it is a little sad for you to be left night after night just at this time when all the world is so gay
but we shall be having our dinnerparties soonas soon as henry comes back from circuitand then there will be a little pleasant variety for you
no wonder it is moped poor darling  margaret did not feel as if the dinnerparties would be a panacea
but edith piqued herself on her dinnerparties so different as she said from the old dowager dinners under mammas rgime and mrs shaw herself seemed to take exactly the same kind of pleasure in the very different arrangements and circle of acquaintances which were to captain and mrs lennoxs taste as she did in the more formal and ponderous entertainments which she herself used to give
captain lennox was always extremely kind and brotherly to margaret
she was really very fond of him excepting when he was anxiously attentive to ediths dress and appearance with a view to her beauty making a sufficient impression on the world
then all the latent vashti in margaret was roused and she could hardly keep herself from expressing her feelings
the course of margarets day was this a quiet hour or two before a late breakfast an unpunctual meal lazily eaten by weary and halfawake people but yet at which in all its dragged out length she was expected to be present because directly afterwards came a discussion of plans at which although they none of them concerned her she was expected to give her sympathy if she could not assist with her advice an endless number of notes to write which edith invariably left to her with many caressing compliments as to her eloquence du billet a little play with sholto as he returned from his mornings walk besides the care of the children during the servants dinner a drive or callers and some dinner or morning engagement for her aunt and cousins which left margaret free it is true but rather wearied with the inactivity of the day coming upon depressed spirits and delicate health
she looked forward with longing though unspoken interest to the homely object of dixons return from milton where until now the old servant had been busily engaged in winding up all the affairs of the hale family
it had appeared a sudden famine to her heart this entire cessation of any news respecting the people among whom she had lived so long
it was true that dixon in her businesslike letters quoted every now and then an opinion of mr thorntons as to what she had better do about the furniture or how act in regard to the landlord of the crampton terrace house
but it was only here and there that the name came in or any milton name indeed and margaret was sitting one evening all alone in the lennoxs drawingroom not reading dixons letters which yet she held in her hand but thinking over them and recalling the days which had been and picturing the busy life out of which her own had been taken and never missed wondering if all went on in that whirl just as if she and her father had never been questioning within herself if no one in all the crowd missed her not higgins she was not thinking of him when suddenly mr bell was announced and margaret hurried the letters into her workbasket and started up blushing as if she had been doing some guilty thing
oh mr bell
i never thought of seeing you  but you give me a welcome i hope as well as that very pretty start of surprise  have you dined
how did you come
let me order you some dinner  if youre going to have any
otherwise you know there is no one who cares less for eating than i do
but where are the others
gone out to dinner
left you alone  oh yes
and it is such a rest
i was just thinkingbut will you run the risk of dinner
i dont know if there is anything in the house  why to tell you the truth i dined at my club
only they dont cook as well as they did so i thought if you were going to dine i might try and make out my dinner
but never mind never mind
there arent ten cooks in england to be trusted at impromptu dinners
if their skill and their fires will stand it their tempers wont
you shall make me some tea margaret
and now what were you thinking of
you were going to tell me
whose letters were those goddaughter that you hid away so speedily  only dixons replied margaret growing very red
whew
is that all
who do you think came up in the train with me  i dont know said margaret resolved against making a guess
your what dye call him
whats the right name for a cousininlaws brother  mr
henry lennox asked margaret
yes replied mr bell
you knew him formerly didnt you
what sort of a person is he margaret  i liked him long ago said margaret glancing down for a moment
and then she looked straight up and went on in her natural manner
you know we have been corresponding about frederick since but i have not seen him for nearly three years and he may be changed
what did you think of him  i dont know
he was so busy trying to find out who i was in the first instance and what i was in the second that he never let out what he was unless indeed that veiled curiosity of his as to what manner of man he had to talk to was not a good piece and a fair indication of his character
do you call him goodlooking margaret  no
certainly not
do you  not i
but i thought perhaps you might
is he a great deal here  i fancy he is when he is in town
he has been on circuit now since i came
butmr bellhave you come from oxford or from milton  from milton
dont you see im smokedried  certainly
but i thought that it might be the effect of the antiquities of oxford  come now be a sensible woman
in oxford i could have managed all the landlords in the place and had my own way with half the trouble your milton landlord has given me and defeated me after all
he wont take the house off our hands till next june twelvemonth
luckily mr thornton found a tenant for it
why dont you ask after mr thornton margaret
he has proved himself a very active friend of yours i can tell you
taken more than half the trouble off my hands  and how is he
how is mrs thornton asked margaret hurriedly and below her breath though she tried to speak out
i suppose theyre well
ive been staying at their house till i was driven out of it by the perpetual clack about that thornton girls marriage
it was too much for thornton himself though she was his sister
he used to go and sit in his own room perpetually
hes getting past the age for caring for such things either as principal or accessory
i was surprised to find the old lady falling into the current and carried away by her daughters enthusiasm for orangeblossoms and lace
i thought mrs thornton had been made of sterner stuff  she would put on any assumption of feeling to veil her daughters weakness said margaret in a low voice
perhaps so
youve studied her have you
she doesnt seem over fond of you margaret  i know it said margaret
oh here is tea at last exclaimed she as if relieved
and with tea came mr henry lennox who had walked up to harley street after a late dinner and had evidently expected to find his brother and sisterinlaw at home
margaret suspected him of being as thankful as she was at the presence of a third party on this their first meeting since the memorable day of his offer and her refusal at helstone
she could hardly tell what to say at first and was thankful for all the teatable occupations which gave her an excuse for keeping silence and him an opportunity for recovering himself
for to tell the truth he had rather forced himself up to harley street this evening with a view of getting over an awkward meeting awkward even in the presence of captain lennox and edith and doubly awkward now that he found her the only lady there and the person to whom he must naturally and perforce address a great part of his conversation
she was the first to recover her selfpossession
she began to talk on the subject which came uppermost in her mind after the first flush of awkward shyness
mr
lennox i have been so much obliged to you for all you have done about frederick  i am only sorry it has been so unsuccessful replied he with a quick glance towards mr bell as if reconnoitring how much he might say before him
margaret as if she read his thought addressed herself to mr bell both including him in the conversation and implying that he was perfectly aware of the endeavours that had been made to clear frederick
that horrocksthat very last witness of all has proved as unavailing as all the others
mr lennox has discovered that he sailed for australia only last august only two months before frederick was in england and gave us the names of  frederick in england
you never told me that exclaimed mr bell in surprise
i thought you knew
i never doubted you had been told
of course it was a great secret and perhaps i should not have named it now said margaret a little dismayed
i have never named it to either my brother or your cousin said mr lennox with a little professional dryness of implied reproach
never mind margaret
i am not living in a talking babbling world nor yet among people who are trying to worm facts out of me you neednt look so frightened because you have let the cat out of the bag to a faithful old hermit like me
i shall never name his having been in england i shall be out of temptation for no one will ask me
stay interrupting himself rather abruptly
was it at your mothers funeral  he was with mamma when she died said margaret softly
to be sure
to be sure
why some one asked me if he had not been over then and i denied it stoutlynot many weeks agowho could it have been
oh
i recollect  but he did not say the name and although margaret would have given much to know if her suspicions were right and it had been mr thornton who had made the enquiry she could not ask the question of mr bell much as she longed to do so
there was a pause for a moment or two
then mr lennox said addressing himself to margaret i suppose as mr bell is now acquainted with all the circumstances attending your brothers unfortunate dilemma i cannot do better than inform him exactly how the research into the evidence we once hoped to produce in his favour stands at present
so if he will do me the honour to breakfast with me tomorrow we will go over the names of these missing gentry  i should like to hear all the particulars if i may
cannot you come here
i dare not ask you both to breakfast though i am sure you would be welcome
but let me know all you can about frederick even though there may be no hope at present  i have an engagement at halfpast eleven
but i will certainly come if you wish it replied mr lennox with a little afterthought of extreme willingness which made margaret shrink into herself and almost wish that she had not proposed her natural request
mr bell got up and looked around him for his hat which had been removed to make room for tea
well said he i dont know what mr lennox is inclined to do but im disposed to be moving off homewards
ive been a journey today and journeys begin to tell upon my sixty and odd years  i believe i shall stay and see my brother and sister said mr lennox making no movement of departure
margaret was seized with a shy awkward dread of being left alone with him
the scene on the little terrace in the helstone garden was so present to her that she could hardly help believing it was so with him
dont go yet please mr bell said she hastily
i want you to see edith and i want edith to know you
please said she laying a light but determined hand on his arm
he looked at her and saw the confusion stirring in her countenance he sate down again as if her little touch had been possessed of resistless strength
you see how she overpowers me mr lennox said he
and i hope you noticed the happy choice of her expressions she wants me to see this cousin edith who i am told is a great beauty but she has the honesty to change her word when she comes to memrs lennox is to know me
i suppose i am not much to see eh margaret  he joked to give her time to recover from the slight flutter which he had detected in her manner on his proposal to leave and she caught the tone and threw the ball back
mr lennox wondered how his brother the captain could have reported her as having lost all her good looks
to be sure in her quiet black dress she was a contrast to edith dancing in her white crape mourning and long floating golden hair all softness and glitter
she dimpled and blushed most becomingly when introduced to mr bell conscious that she had her reputation as a beauty to keep up and that it would not do to have a mordecai refusing to worship and admire even in the shape of an old fellow of a college which nobody had ever heard of
mrs shaw and captain lennox each in their separate way gave mr bell a kind and sincere welcome winning him over to like them almost in spite of himself especially when he saw how naturally margaret took her place as sister and daughter of the house
what a shame that we were not at home to receive you said edith
you too henry
though i dont know that we should have stayed at home for you
and for mr bell
for margarets mr bell  there is no knowing what sacrifices you would not have made said her brotherinlaw
even a dinnerparty
and the delight of wearing this very becoming dress  edith did not know whether to frown or to smile but it did not suit mr lennox to drive her to the first of these alternatives so he went on
will you show your readiness to make sacrifices tomorrow morning first by asking me to breakfast to meet mr bell and secondly by being so kind as to order it at halfpast nine instead of at ten oclock
i have some letters and papers that i want to show to miss hale and mr bell  i hope mr bell will make our house his own during his stay in london said captain lennox
i am only so sorry we cannot offer him a bedroom  thank you
i am much obliged to you
you would only think me a churl if you had for i should decline it i believe in spite of all the temptations of such agreeable company said mr bell bowing all round and secretly congratulating himself on the neat turn he had given to his sentence which if put into plain language would have been more to this effect i couldnt stand the restraints of such a properbehaved and civilspoken people as these are it would be like meat without salt
im thankful they havent a bed
and how well i rounded my sentence
im absolutely catching the trick of good manners  his selfsatisfaction lasted him till he was fairly out in the streets walking side by side with henry lennox
here he suddenly remembered margarets little look of entreaty as she urged him to stay longer and he also recollected a few hints given him long ago by an acquaintance of mr lennoxs as to his admiration of margaret
it gave a new direction to his thoughts
you have known miss hale for a long time i believe
how do you think her looking
she strikes me as pale and ill  i thought her looking remarkably well
perhaps not when i first camenow i think of
but certainly when she grew animated she looked as well as ever i saw her do  she has had a great deal to go through said mr bell
yes
i have been sorry to hear of all she has had to bear not merely the common and universal sorrow arising from death but all the annoyance which her fathers conduct must have caused her and then  her fathers conduct said mr bell in an accent of surprise
you must have heard some wrong statement
he behaved in the most conscientious manner
he showed more resolute strength than i should ever have given him credit for formerly  perhaps i have been wrongly informed
but i have been told by his successor in the livinga clever sensible man and a thoroughly active clergymanthat there was no call upon mr hale to do what he did relinquish the living and throw himself and his family on the tender mercies of private teaching in a manufacturing town the bishop had offered him another living it is true but if he had come to entertain certain doubts he could have remained where he was and so had no occasion to resign
but the truth is these country clergymen live such isolated livesisolated i mean from all intercourse with men of equal cultivation with themselves by whose minds they might regulate their own and discover when they were going either too fast or too slowthat they are very apt to disturb themselves with imaginary doubts as to the articles of faith and throw up certain opportunities of doing good for very uncertain fancies of their own  i differ from you
i do not think they are very apt to do as my poor friend hale did mr bell was inwardly chafing
perhaps i used too general an expression in saying very apt but certainly their lives are such as very often to produce either inordinate selfsufficiency or a morbid state of conscience replied mr lennox with perfect coolness
you dont meet with any selfsufficiency among the lawyers for instance asked mr bell
and seldom i imagine any cases of morbid conscience he was becoming more and more vexed and forgetting his latelycaught trick of good manners
mr lennox saw now that he had annoyed his companion and as he had talked pretty much for the sake of saying something and so passing the time away while their road lay together he was very indifferent as to the exact side he took upon the question and quietly came round by saying to be sure there is something fine in a man of mr hales age leaving his home of twenty years and giving up all settled habits for an idea which was probably erroneousbut that does not matteran untangible thought
one cannot help admiring him with a mixture of pity in ones admiration something like what one feels for don quixote
such a gentleman as he was too
i shall never forget the refined and simple hospitality he showed to me that last day at helstone  only halfmollified and yet anxious in order to lull certain qualms of his own conscience to believe that mr hales conduct had a tinge of quixotism in it mr bell growled outaye
and you dont know milton
such a change from helstone
it is years since i have been at helstonebut ill answer for it it is standing there yetevery stick and every stone as it has done for the last century while milton
i go there every four or five yearsand i was born thereyet i do assure you i often lose my wayaye among the very piles of warehouses that are built upon my fathers orchard
do we part here
well goodnight sir i suppose we shall meet in harley street tomorrow morning      not all a dream
where are the sounds that swam along     the buoyant air when i was young     the last vibration now is oer     and they who listened are no more     ah
let me close my eyes and dream               w s landor
the idea of helstone had been suggested to mr bells waking mind by his conversation with mr lennox and all night long it ran riot through his dreams
he was again the tutor in the college where he now held the rank of fellow it was again a long vacation and he was staying with his newlymarried friend the proud husband and happy vicar of helstone
over babbling brooks they took impossible leaps which seemed to keep them whole days suspended in the air
time and space were not though all other things seemed real
every event was measured by the emotions of the mind not by its actual existence for existence it had none
but the trees were gorgeous in their autumnal leafinessthe warm odours of flower and herb came sweet upon the sensethe young wife moved about the house with just that mixture of annoyance at her position as regarded wealth with pride in her handsome and devoted husband which mr bell had noticed in real life a quarter of a century ago
the dream was so like life that when he awoke his present life seemed a dream
where was he
in the close handsomely furnished room of a london hotel
where were those who spoke to him moved around him touched him not an instant ago
dead
buried
lost for evermore as far as earths for evermore would extend
he was an old man so lately exultant in the full strength of manhood
the utter loneliness of his life was insupportable to think about
he got up hastily and tried to forget what never more might be in a hurried dressing for the breakfast in harley street
he could not attend to all the lawyers details which as he saw made margarets eyes dilate and her lips grow pale as one by one fate decreed or so it seemed every morsel of evidence which would exonerate frederick should fall from beneath her feet and disappear
even mr lennoxs wellregulated professional voice took a softer tenderer tone as he drew near to the extinction of the last hope
it was not that margaret had not been perfectly aware of the result before
it was only that the details of each successive disappointment came with such relentless minuteness to quench all hope that she at last fairly gave way to tears
mr lennox stopped reading
i had better not go on said he in a concerned voice
it was a foolish proposal of mine
lieutenant hale and even this giving him the title of the service from which he had so harshly been expelled was soothing to margaret
lieutenant hale is happy now more secure in fortune and future prospects than he could ever have been in the navy and has doubtless adopted his wifes country as his own  that is it said margaret
it seems so selfish in me to regret it trying to smile and yet he is lost to me and i am so lonely mr lennox turned over his papers and wished that he were as rich and prosperous as he believed he should be some day
mr bell blew his nose but otherwise he also kept silence and margaret in a minute or two had apparently recovered her usual composure
she thanked mr lennox very courteously for his trouble all the more courteously and graciously because she was conscious that by her behaviour he might probably be led to imagine that he had given her needless pain
yet it was pain she would not have been without
mr bell came up to wish her goodbye
margaret said he as he fumbled with his gloves i am going down to helstone tomorrow to look at the old place
would you like to come with me
or would it give you too much pain
speak out dont be afraid  oh mr bell said sheand could say no more
but she took his old gouty hand and kissed it
come come thats enough said he reddening with awkwardness
i suppose your aunt shaw will trust you with me
well go tomorrow morning and we shall get there about two oclock i fancy
well take a snack and order dinner at the little innthe lennard arms it used to beand go and get an appetite in the forest
can you stand it margaret
it will be a trial i know to both of us but it will be a pleasure to me at least
and there well dineit will be but doevenison if we can get it at alland then ill take my nap while you go out and see old friends
ill give you back safe and sound barring railway accidents and ill insure your life for a thousand pounds before starting which may be some comfort to your relations but otherwise ill bring you back to mrs shaw by lunch time on friday
so if you say yes ill just go upstairs and propose it  its no use my trying to say how much i shall like it said margaret through her tears
well then prove your gratitude by keeping those fountains of yours dry for the next two days
if you dont i shall feel queer myself about the lachrymal ducts and i dont like that  i wont cry a drop said margaret winking her eyes to shake the tears off her eyelashes and forcing a smile
theres my good girl
then well go upstairs and settle it all margaret was in a state of almost trembling eagerness while mr bell discussed his plan with her aunt shaw who was first startled then doubtful and perplexed and in the end yielding rather to the rough force of mr bells words than to her own conviction for to the last whether it was right or wrong proper or improper she could not settle to her own satisfaction till margarets safe return the happy fulfilment of the project gave her decision enough to say she was sure it had been a very kind thought of mr bells and just what she herself had been wishing for margaret as giving her the very change which she required after all the anxious time she had had      once and now
so on those happy days of yore     oft as i dare to dwell once more     still must i miss the friends so tried     whom death has severed from my side
but ever when true friendship binds     spirit it is that spirit finds     in spirit then our bliss we found     in spirit yet to them im bound               uhland
margaret was ready long before the appointed time and had leisure enough to cry a little quietly when unobserved and to smile brightly when any one looked at her
her last alarm was lest they should be too late and miss the train but no
they were all in time and she breathed freely and happily at length seated in the carriage opposite to mr bell and whirling away past the wellknown stations seeing the old south countrytowns and hamlets sleeping in the warm light of the pure sun which gave a yet ruddier colour to their tiled roofs so different to the cold slates of the north
broods of pigeons hovered around these peaked quaint gables slowly settling here and there and ruffling their soft shiny feathers as if exposing every fibre to the delicious warmth
there were few people about at the stations it almost seemed as if they were too lazily content to wish to travel none of the bustle and stir that margaret had noticed in her two journeys on the london and northwestern line
later on in the year this line of railway should be stirring and alive with rich pleasureseekers but as to the constant going to and fro of busy tradespeople it would always be widely different from the northern lines
here a spectator or two stood lounging at nearly every station with his hands in his pockets so absorbed in the simple act of watching that it made the travellers wonder what he could find to do when the train whirled away and only the blank of a railway some sheds and a distant field or two were left for him to gaze upon
the hot air danced over the golden stillness of the land farm after farm was left behind each reminding margaret of german idyllsof herman and dorotheaof evangeline
from this waking dream she was roused
it was the place to leave the train and take the fly to helstone
and now sharper feelings came shooting through her heart whether pain or pleasure she could hardly tell
every mile was redolent of associations which she would not have missed for the world but each of which made her cry upon the days that are no more with ineffable longing
the last time she had passed along this road was when she had left it with her father and motherthe day the season had been gloomy and she herself hopeless but they were there with her
now she was alone an orphan and they strangely had gone away from her and vanished from the face of the earth
it hurt her to see the helstone road so flooded in the sunlight and every turn and every familiar tree so precisely the same in its summer glory as it had been in former years
nature felt no change and was ever young
mr bell knew something of what would be passing through her mind and wisely and kindly held his tongue
they drove up to the lennard arms half farmhouse halfinn standing a little apart from the road as much as to say that the host did not so depend on the custom of travellers as to have to court it by any obtrusiveness they rather must seek him out
the house fronted the village green and right before it stood an immemorial limetree benched all round in some hidden recesses of whose leafy wealth hung the grim escutcheon of the lennards
the door of the inn stood wide open but there was no hospitable hurry to receive the travellers
when the landlady did appearand they might have abstracted many an article firstshe gave them a kind welcome almost as if they had been invited guests and apologised for her coming having been so delayed by saying that it was haytime and the provisions for the men had to be sent afield and she had been too busy packing up the baskets to hear the noise of wheels over the road which since they left the highway ran over soft short turf
why bless me exclaimed she as at the end of her apology a glint of sunshine showed her margarets face hitherto unobserved in that shady parlour
its miss hale jenny said she running to the door and calling to her daughter
come here come directly its miss hale and then she went up to margaret and shook hands with motherly fondness
and how are you all
hows the vicar and miss dixon
the vicar above all
god bless him
weve never ceased to be sorry that he left  margaret tried to speak and tell her of her fathers death of her mothers it was evident that mrs purkis was aware from her omission of her name
but she choked in the effort and could only touch her deep mourning and say the one word papa  surely sir its never so said mrs purkis turning to mr bell for confirmation of the sad suspicion that now entered her mind
there was a gentleman here in the springmight have been as long ago as last winterwho told us a deal of mr hale and miss margaret and he said mrs hale was gone poor lady
but never a word of the vicars being ailing  it is so however said mr bell
he died quite suddenly when on a visit to me at oxford
he was a good man mrs purkis and theres many of us that might be thankful to have as calm an end as his
come margaret my dear
her father was my oldest friend and shes my goddaughter so i thought we would just come down together and see the old place and i know of old you can give us comfortable rooms and a capital dinner
you dont remember me i see but my name is bell and once or twice when the parsonage has been full ive slept here and tasted your good ale  to be sure i ask your pardon but you see i was taken up with miss hale
let me show you to a room miss margaret where you can take off your bonnet and wash your face
its only this very morning i plunged some freshgathered roses head downward in the waterjug for thought i perhaps some one will be coming and theres nothing so sweet as springwater scented by a musk rose or two
to think of the vicar being dead
well to be sure we must all die only that gentleman said he was quite picking up after his trouble about mrs hales death  come down to me mrs purkis after you have attended to miss hale
i want to have a consultation with you about dinner  the little casement window in margarets bedchamber was almost filled up with rose and vine branches but pushing them aside and stretching a little out she could see the tops of the parsonage chimneys above the trees and distinguish many a wellknown line through the leaves
aye said mrs purkis smoothing down the bed and despatching jenny for an armful of lavenderscented towels times is changed miss our new vicar has seven children and is building a nursery ready for more just where the arbour and toolhouse used to be in old times
and he has had new grates put in and a plateglass window in the drawingroom
he and his wife are stirring people and have done a deal of good at least they say its doing good if it were not i should call it turning things upside down for very little purpose
the new vicar is a teetotaller miss and a magistrate and his wife has a deal of receipts for economical cooking and is for making bread without yeast and they both talk so much and both at a time that they knock one down as it were and its not till theyre gone and ones a little at peace that one can think that there were things one might have said on ones own side of the question
hell be after the mens cans in the hayfield and peeping in and then therell be an ado because its not gingerbeer but i cant help it
my mother and my grandmother before me sent good malt liquor to haymakers and took salts and senna when anything ailed them and i must een go on in their ways though mrs hepworth does want to give me comfits instead of medicine which as she says is a deal pleasanter only ive no faith in it
but i must go miss though im wanting to hear many a thing ill come back to you before long  mr bell had strawberries and cream a loaf of brown bread and a jug of milk together with a stilton cheese and a bottle of port for his own private refreshment ready for margaret on her coming down stairs and after this rustic luncheon they set out for a walk hardly knowing in what direction to turn so many old familiar inducements were there in each
shall we go past the vicarage asked mr bell
no not yet
we will go this way and make a round so as to come back by it said margaret
here and there old trees had been felled the autumn before or a squatters cottage roughlybuilt and decaying cottage had disappeared
margaret missed them each and all and grieved over them like old friends
they came past the spot where she and mr lennox had sketched
the white lightningscarred trunk of the venerable beech among whose roots they had sate down was there no more the old man the inhabitant of the ruinous cottage was dead the cottage had been pulled down and a new one tidy and respectable had been built in its stead
there was a small garden on the place where the beechtree had been
i did not think i had been so old said margaret after a pause of silence and she turned away sighing
yes said mr bell
it is the first changes among familiar things that make such a mystery of time to the young afterwards we lose the sense of the mysterious
i take changes in all i see as a matter of course
the instability of all human things is familiar to me to you it is new and oppressive  let us go on to see little susan said margaret drawing her companion up a grassy roadway leading under the shadow of a forest glade
with all my heart though i have not an idea who little susan may be
but i have a kindness for all susans for simple susans sake  my little susan was disappointed when i left without wishing her goodbye and it has been on my conscience ever since that i gave her pain which a little more exertion on my part might have prevented
but it is a long way
are you sure you will not be tired  quite sure
that is if you dont walk so fast
you see here there are no views that can give one an excuse for stopping to take breath
you would think it romantic to be walking with a person fat and scant o breath if i were hamlet prince of denmark
have compassion on my infirmities for his sake  i will walk slower for your own sake
i like you twenty times better than hamlet  on the principle that a living ass is better than a dead lion  perhaps so
i dont analyse my feelings  i am content to take your liking me without examining too curiously into the materials it is made of
only we need not walk at a snails pace  very well
walk at your own pace and i will follow
or stop still and meditate like the hamlet you compare yourself to if i go too fast  thank you
but as my mother has not murdered my father and afterwards married my uncle i shouldnt know what to think about unless it were balancing the chances of our having a wellcooked dinner or not
what do you think  i am in good hopes
she used to be considered a famous cook as far as helstone opinion went  but have you considered the distraction of mind produced by all this haymaking  margaret felt all mr bells kindness in trying to make cheerful talk about nothing to endeavour to prevent her from thinking too curiously about the past
but she would rather have gone over these dearloved walks in silence if indeed she were not ungrateful enough to wish that she might have been alone
they reached the cottage where susans widowed mother lived
susan was not there
she was gone to the parochial school
margaret was disappointed and the poor woman saw it and began to make a kind of apology
oh
it is quite right said margaret
i am very glad to hear it
i might have thought of it
only she used to stop at home with you  yes she did and i miss her sadly
i used to teach her what little i knew at nights
it were not much to be sure
but she were getting such a handy girl that i miss her sore
but shes a deal above me in learning now and the mother sighed
im all wrong growled mr bell
dont mind what i say
im a hundred years behind the world
but i should say that the child was getting a better and simpler and more natural education stopping at home and helping her mother and learning to read a chapter in the new testament every night by her side than from all the schooling under the sun  margaret did not want to encourage him to go on by replying to him and so prolonging the discussion before the mother
so she turned to her and asked  how is old betty barnes  i dont know said the woman rather shortly
wese not friends  why not asked margaret who had formerly been the peacemaker of the village
she stole my cat  did she know it was yours  i dont know
i reckon not  well
could not you get it back again when you told her it was yours  no
for shed burnt it  burnt it exclaimed both margaret and mr bell
roasted it explained the woman
it was no explanation
by dint of questioning margaret extracted from her the horrible fact that betty barnes having been induced by a gipsy fortuneteller to lend the latter her husbands sunday clothes on promise of having them faithfully returned on the saturday night before goodman barnes should have missed them became alarmed by their nonappearance and her consequent dread of her husbands anger and as according to one of the savage country superstitions the cries of a cat in the agonies of being boiled or roasted alive compelled as it were the powers of darkness to fulfil the wishes of the executioner resort had been had to the charm
the poor woman evidently believed in its efficacy her only feeling was indignation that her cat had been chosen out from all others for a sacrifice
margaret listened in horror and endeavoured in vain to enlighten the womans mind but she was obliged to give it up in despair
step by step she got the woman to admit certain facts of which the logical connexion and sequence was perfectly clear to margaret but at the end the bewildered woman simply repeated her first assertion namely that it were very cruel for sure and she should not like to do it but that there was nothing like it for giving a person what they wished for she had heard it all her life but it were very cruel for all that margaret gave it up in despair and walked away sick at heart
you are a good girl not to triumph over me said mr bell
how
what do you mean  i own i am wrong about schooling
anything rather than have that child brought up in such practical paganism  oh
i remember
poor little susan
i must go and see her would you mind calling at the school  not a bit
i am curious to see something of the teaching she is to receive  they did not speak much more but thridded their way through many a bosky dell whose soft green influence could not charm away the shock and the pain in margarets heart caused by the recital of such cruelty a recital too the manner of which betrayed such utter want of imagination and therefore of any sympathy with the suffering animal
the buzz of voices like the murmur of a hive of busy human bees made itself heard as soon as they emerged from the forest on the more open villagegreen on which the school was situated
the door was wide open and they entered
a brisk lady in black here there and everywhere perceived them and bade them welcome with somewhat of the hostessair which margaret remembered her mother was wont to assume only in a more soft and languid manner when any rare visitors strayed in to inspect the school
she knew at once it was the present vicars wife her mothers successor and she would have drawn back from the interview had it been possible but in an instant she had conquered this feeling and modestly advanced meeting many a bright glance of recognition and hearing many a halfsuppressed murmur of its miss hale the vicars lady heard the name and her manner at once became more kindly
margaret wished she could have helped feeling that it also became more patronizing
the lady held out a hand to mr bell with  your father i presume miss hale
i see it by the likeness
i am sure i am very glad to see you sir and so will the vicar be  margaret explained that it was not her father and stammered out the fact of his death wondering all the time how mr hale could have borne coming to revisit helstone if it had been as the vicars lady supposed
she did not hear what mrs hepworth was saying and left it to mr bell to reply looking round meanwhile for her old acquaintances
ah
i see you would like to take a class miss hale
i know it by myself
first class stand up for a parsing lesson with miss hale  poor margaret whose visit was sentimental not in any degree inspective felt herself taken in but as in some way bringing her in contact with little eager faces once wellknown and who had received the solemn rite of baptism from her father she sate down half losing herself in tracing out the changing features of the girls and holding susans hand for a minute or two unobserved by all while the first class sought for their books and the vicars lady went as near as a lady could towards holding mr bell by the button while she explained the phonetic system to him and gave him a conversation she had had with the inspector about it
margaret bent over her book and seeing nothing but thathearing the buzz of childrens voices old times rose up and she thought of them and her eyes filled with tears till all at once there was a pauseone of the girls was stumbling over the apparently simple word a uncertain what to call it
a an indefinite article said margaret mildly
i beg your pardon said the vicars wife all eyes and ears but we are taught by mr milsome to call a anwho can remember  an adjective absolute said halfadozen voices at once
and margaret sate abashed
the children knew more than she did
mr bell turned away and smiled
margaret spoke no more during the lesson
but after it was over she went quietly round to one or two old favourites and talked to them a little
they were growing out of children into great girls passing out of their recollection in their rapid development as she by her three years absence was vanishing from theirs
still she was glad to have seen them all again though a tinge of sadness mixed itself with her pleasure
when school was over for the day it was yet early in the summer afternoon and mrs hepworth proposed to margaret that she and mr bell should accompany her to the parsonage and seethe word improvements had half slipped out of her mouth but she substituted the more cautious term alterations which the present vicar was making
margaret did not care a straw about seeing the alterations which jarred upon her fond recollection of what her home had been but she longed to see the old place once more even though she shivered away from the pain which she knew she should feel
the parsonage was so altered both inside and out that the real pain was less than she anticipated
it was not like the same place
the garden the grassplat formerly so daintily trim that even a stray roseleaf seemed like a fleck on the exquisite arrangement and propriety was strewed with childrens things a bag of marbles here a hoop there a strawhat forced down upon a rosetree as on a peg to the destruction of a long beautiful tender branch laden with flowers which in former days would have been trained up tenderly as if beloved
the little square matted hall was equally filled with signs of merry healthy rough childhood
ah said mrs hepworth you must excuse this untidiness miss hale
when the nursery is finished i shall insist upon a little order
we are building a nursery out of your room i believe
how did you manage miss hale without a nursery  we were but two said margaret
you have many children i presume  seven
look here
we are throwing out a window to the road on this side
mr hepworth is spending an immense deal of money on this house but really it was scarcely habitable when we camefor so large a family as ours i mean of course every room in the house was changed besides the one of which mrs hepworth spoke which had been mr hales study formerly and where the green gloom and delicious quiet of the place had conduced as he had said to a habit of meditation but perhaps in some degree to the formation of a character more fitted for thought than action
the new window gave a view of the road and had many advantages as mrs hepworth pointed out
from it the wandering sheep of her husbands flock might be seen who straggled to the tempting beerhouse unobserved as they might hope but not unobserved in reality for the active vicar kept his eye on the road even during the composition of his most orthodox sermons and had a hat and stick hanging ready at hand to seize before sallying out after his parishioners who had need of quick legs if they could take refuge in the jolly forester before the teetotal vicar had arrested them
the whole family were quick brisk loudtalking kindhearted and not troubled with much delicacy of perception
margaret feared that mrs hepworth would find out that mr bell was playing upon her in the admiration he thought fit to express for everything that especially grated on his taste
but no
she took it all literally and with such good faith that margaret could not help remonstrating with him as they walked slowly away from the parsonage back to their inn
dont scold margaret
it was all because of you
if she had not shown you every change with such evident exultation in their superior sense in perceiving what an improvement this and that would be i could have behaved well
but if you must go on preaching keep it till after dinner when it will send me to sleep and help my digestion  they were both of them tired and margaret herself so much so that she was unwilling to go out as she had proposed to do and have another ramble among the woods and fields so close to the home of her childhood
and somehow this visit to helstone had not been allhad not been exactly what she had expected
there was change everywhere slight yet pervading all
households were changed by absence or death or marriage or the natural mutations brought by days and months and years which carry us on imperceptibly from childhood to youth and thence through manhood to age whence we drop like fruit fully ripe into the quiet mother earth
places were changeda tree gone here a bough there bringing in a long ray of light where no light was beforea road was trimmed and narrowed and the green straggling pathway by its side enclosed and cultivated
a great improvement it was called but margaret sighed over the old picturesqueness the old gloom and the grassy wayside of former days
she sate by the window on the little settle sadly gazing out upon the gathering shades of night which harmonized well with her pensive thought
mr bell slept soundly after his unusual exercise through the day
at last he was roused by the entrance of the teatray brought in by a flushedlooking countrygirl who had evidently been finding some variety from her usual occupation of waiter in assisting this day in the hayfield
hallo
whos there
where are we
whos thatmargaret
oh now i remember all
i could not imagine what woman was sitting there in such a doleful attitude with her hands clasped straight out upon her knees and her face looking so steadfastly before her
what are you looking at asked mr bell coming to the window and standing behind margaret
nothing said she rising up quickly and speaking as cheerfully as she could at a moments notice
nothing indeed
a bleak background of trees some white linen hung out on the sweetbriar hedge and a great waft of damp air
shut the window and come in and make tea  margaret was silent for some time
she played with her teaspoon and did not attend particularly to what mr bell said
he contradicted her and she took the same sort of smiling notice of his opinion as if he had agreed with her
then she sighed and putting down her spoon she began apropos of nothing at all and in the highpitched voice which usually shows that the speaker has been thinking for some time on the subject that they wish to introducemr
bell you remember what we were saying about frederick last night dont you  last night
where was i
oh i remember
why it seems a week ago
yes to be sure i recollect we talked about him poor fellow  yesand do you remember that mr lennox spoke about his having been in england about the time of dear mammas death asked margaret her voice now lower than usual
i recollect
i hadnt heard of it before  and i thoughti always thought that papa had told you about it  no
he never did
but what about it margaret  i want to tell you of something i did that was very wrong about that time said margaret suddenly looking up at him with her clear honest eyes
i told a lie and her face became scarlet
true that was bad i own not but what i have told a pretty round number in my life not all in downright words as i suppose you did but in actions or in some shabby circumlocutory way leading people either to disbelieve the truth or believe a falsehood
you know who is the father of lies margaret
well
a great number of folk thinking themselves very good have odd sorts of connexion with lies lefthand marriages and secondcousinsonceremoved
the tainting blood of falsehood runs through us all
i should have guessed you as far from it as most people
what
crying child
nay now well not talk of it if it ends in this way
i dare say you have been sorry for it and that you wont do it again and its long ago now and in short i want you to be very cheerful and not very sad this evening  margaret wiped her eyes and tried to talk about something else but suddenly she burst out afresh
please mr bell let me tell you about ityou could perhaps help me a little no not help me but if you knew the truth perhaps you could put me to rightsthat is not it after all said she in despair at not being able to express herself more exactly as she wished
mr bells whole manner changed
tell me all about it child said he
its a long story but when fred came mamma was very ill and i was undone with anxiety and afraid too that i might have drawn him into danger and we had an alarm just after her death for dixon met some one in miltona man called leonardswho had known fred and who seemed to owe him a grudge or at any rate to be tempted by the recollection of the reward offered for his apprehension and with this new fright i thought i had better hurry off fred to london where as you would understand from what we said the other night he was to go to consult mr lennox as to his chances if he stood trial
so wethat is he and iwent to the railway station it was one evening and it was just getting rather dusk but still light enough to recognize and be recognized and we were too early and went out to walk in a field just close by i was always in a panic about this leonards who was i knew somewhere in the neighbourhood and then when we were in the field the low red sunlight just in my face some one came by on horseback in the road just below the fieldstyle on which we stoodi saw him look at me but i did not know who it was at first the sun was so in my eyes but in an instant the dazzle went off and i saw it was mr thornton and we bowed  and he saw frederick of course said mr bell helping her on with her story as he thought
yes and then at the station a man came uptipsy and reelingand he tried to collar fred and overbalanced himself as fred wrenched himself away and fell over the hedge of the platform not far not deep not above three feet but oh
mr bell somehow that fall killed him  how awkward
it was this leonards i suppose
and how did fred get off  oh
he went off immediately after the fall which we never thought could have done the poor fellow any harm it seemed so slight an injury  then he did not die directly  no
not for two or three days
and thenoh mr bell
now comes the bad part said she nervously twining her fingers together
a police inspector came and taxed me with having been a companion of the young man whose push or blow had occasioned leonards death that was a false accusation you know but we had not heard that fred had sailed he might still be in london and liable to be arrested on this false charge and his identity with the lieutenant hale accused of causing the mutiny discovered he might be shot all this flashed through my mind and i said it was not me
i was not at the railway station that night
i knew nothing about it
i had no conscience or thought but to save frederick  i say it was right
i should have done the same
you forgot yourself in thought for another
i hope i should have done the same  no you would not
it was wrong disobedient faithless
at that very time fred was safely out of england and in my blindness i forgot that there was another witness who could testify to my being there  who  mr
thornton
you know he had seen me close to the station we had bowed to each other  well
he would know nothing of this riot about the drunken fellows death
i suppose the injury never came to anything  no
the proceedings they had begun to talk about on the inquest were stopped
mr thornton did know all about it
he was a magistrate and he found out that it was not the fall that had caused the death
but not before he knew what i had said
oh mr bell she suddenly covered her face with her hands as if wishing to hide herself from the presence of the recollection
did you have any explanation with him
did you ever tell him the strong instinctive motive  the instinctive want of faith and clutching at a sin to keep myself from sinking said she bitterly
no
how could i
he knew nothing of frederick
to put myself to rights in his good opinion was i to tell him the secrets of our family involving as they seemed to do the chances of poor fredericks entire exculpation
freds last words had been to enjoin me to keep his visit a secret from all
you see papa never told even you
no
i could bear the shamei thought i could at least
i did bear it
mr thornton has never respected me since  he respects you i am sure said mr bell
to be sure it accounts a little for
but he always speaks of you with regard and esteem though now i understand certain reservations in his manner  margaret did not speak did not attend to what mr bell had to say lost all sense of it
byandby she said  will you tell me what you refer to about reservations in his manner of speaking to me  oh
simply he has annoyed me by not joining in my praises of you
like an old fool i thought that every one would have the same opinion as i had and he evidently could not agree with me
i was puzzled at the time
but he must be perplexed if the affair has never been in the least explained
there was first your walking out with a young man in the dark  but it was my brother said margaret surprised
true
but how was he to know that  i dont know
i never thought anything of that kind said margaret reddening and looking hurt and offended
and perhaps he never would but for the liewhich under the circumstances i maintain was necessary  it was not
i know it now
i bitterly repent it  there was a long pause of silence
margaret was the first to speak
i am not likely ever to see mr thornton againand there she stopped
there are many things more unlikely i should say replied mr bell
but i believe i never shall
still somehow one does not like to have sunk so low inin a friends opinion as i have done in his her eyes were full of tears but her voice was steady and mr bell was not looking at her
and now that frederick has given up all hope and almost all wish of ever clearing himself and returning to england it would be only doing myself justice to have all this explained
if you please and if you can if there is a good opportunity dont force an explanation upon him pray but if you can will you tell him the whole circumstances and tell him also that i gave you leave to do so because i felt that for poor papas sake i should not like to lose his respect though we may never be likely to meet again  certainly
i think he ought to know
i do not like you to rest even under a shadow of an impropriety he would not know what to think of seeing you alone with a young man  as for that said margaret rather haughtily i hold it is honi soit qui mal y pense yet still i should choose to have it explained if any natural opportunity for easy explanation occurs
but it is not to clear myself of any suspicion of improper conduct that i wish to have him toldif i thought that he had suspected me i should not care for his good opinionno
it is that he may learn how i was tempted and how i fell into the snare why i told that falsehood in short  which i dont blame you for
it is no partiality of mine i assure you  what other people may think of the rightness or wrongness is nothing in comparison to my own deep knowledge my innate conviction that it was wrong
but we will not talk of that any more if you please
it is donemy sin is sinned
i have now to put it behind me and be truthful for evermore if i can  very well
if you like to be uncomfortable and morbid be so
i always keep my conscience as tight shut up as a jackinabox for when it jumps into existence it surprises me by its size
so i coax it down again as the fisherman coaxed the genii
wonderful says i to think that you have been concealed so long and in so small a compass that i really did not know of your existence
pray sir instead of growing larger and larger every instant and bewildering me with your misty outlines would you once more compress yourself into your former dimensions and when ive got him down dont i clap the seal on the vase and take good care how i open it again and how i go against solomon wisest of men who confined him there  but it was no smiling matter to margaret
she hardly attended to what mr bell was saying
her thoughts ran upon the idea before entertained but which now had assumed the strength of a conviction that mr thornton no longer held his former good opinion of herthat he was disappointed in her
she did not feel as if any explanation could ever reinstate hernot in his love for that and any return on her part she had resolved never to dwell upon and she kept rigidly to her resolutionbut in the respect and high regard which she had hoped would have ever made him willing in the spirit of gerald griffins beautiful lines      to turn and look back when thou hearest     the sound of my name  she kept choking and swallowing all the time that she thought about it
she tried to comfort herself with the idea that what he imagined her to be did not alter the fact of what she was
but it was a truism a phantom and broke down under the weight of her regret
she had twenty questions on the tip of her tongue to ask mr bell but not one of them did she utter
mr bell thought that she was tired and sent her early to her room where she sate long hours by the open window gazing out on the purple dome above where the stars arose and twinkled and disappeared behind the great umbrageous trees before she went to bed
all night long too there burnt a little light on earth a candle in her old bedroom which was the nursery with the present inhabitants of the parsonage until the new one was built
a sense of change of individual nothingness of perplexity and disappointment overpowered margaret
nothing had been the same and this slight allpervading instability had given her greater pain than if all had been too entirely changed for her to recognise it
i begin to understand now what heaven must beand oh
the grandeur and repose of the wordsthe same yesterday today and for ever everlasting
from everlasting to everlasting thou art god that beautiful sky above me looks as though it could not change and yet it will
i am so tiredso tired of being whirled on through all these phases of my life in which nothing abides by me no creature no place it is like the circle in which the victims of earthly passion eddy continually
i am in the mood in which women of another religion take the veil
i seek heavenly steadfastness in earthly monotony
if i were a roman catholic and could deaden my heart stun it with some great blow i might become a nun
but i should pine after my kind no not my kind for love for my species could never fill my heart to the utter exclusion of love for individuals
perhaps it ought to be so perhaps not i cannot decide tonight  wearily she went to bed wearily she arose in four or five hours time
but with the morning came hope and a brighter view of things
after all it is right said she hearing the voices of children at play while she was dressing
if the world stood still it would retrograde and become corrupt if that is not irish
looking out of myself and my own painful sense of change the progress of all around me is right and necessary
i must not think so much of how circumstances affect me myself but how they affect others if i wish to have a right judgment or a hopeful trustful heart and with a smile ready in her eyes to quiver down to her lips she went into the parlour and greeted mr bell
ah missy
you were up late last night and so youre late this morning
now ive got a little piece of news for you
what do you think of an invitation to dinner
a morning call literally in the dewy morning
why ive had the vicar here already on his way to the school
how much the desire of giving our hostess a teetotal lecture for the benefit of the haymakers had to do with his earliness i dont know but here he was when i came down just before nine and we are asked to dine there today  but edith expects me backi cannot go said margaret thankful to have so good an excuse
yes
i know so i told him
i thought you would not want to go
still it is open if you would like it  oh no said margaret
let us keep to our plan
let us start at twelve
it is very good and kind of them but indeed i could not go  very well
dont fidget yourself and ill arrange it all  before they left margaret stole round to the back of the vicarage garden and gathered a little straggling piece of honeysuckle
she would not take a flower the day before for fear of being observed and her motives and feelings commented upon
but as she returned across the common the place was reinvested with the old enchanting atmosphere
the common sounds of life were more musical there than anywhere else in the whole world the light more golden the life more tranquil and full of dreamy delight
as margaret remembered her feelings yesterday she said to herself  and i too change perpetuallynow this now thatnow disappointment and peevish because all is not exactly as i had pictured it and now suddenly discovering that the reality is far more beautiful than i had imagined it
oh helstone
i shall never love any place like you  a few days afterwards she had found her level and decided that she was very glad to have been there and that she had seen it again and that to her it would always be the prettiest spot in the world but that it was so full of associations with former days and especially with her father and mother that if it were all to come over again she should shrink back from such another visit as that which she had paid with mr bell
something wanting
experience like a pale musician holds     a dulcimer of patience in his hand     whence harmonies we cannot understand     of gods will in his worlds the strain unfolds     in sad perplexed minors               mrs browning
about this time dixon returned from milton and assumed her post as margarets maid
she brought endless pieces of milton gossip how martha had gone to live with miss thornton on the latters marriage with an account of the bridesmaids dresses and breakfasts at that interesting ceremony how people thought that mr thornton had made too grand a wedding of it considering he had lost a deal by the strike and had had to pay so much for the failure of his contracts how little money articles of furniturelong cherished by dixonhad fetched at the sale which was a shame considering how rich folks were at milton how mrs thornton had come one day and got two or three good bargains and mr thornton had come the next and in his desire to obtain one or two things had bid against himself much to the enjoyment of the bystanders so as dixon observed that made things even if mrs thornton paid too little mr thornton paid too much
mr bell had sent all sorts of orders about the books there was no understanding him he was so particular if he had come himself it would have been all right but letters always were and always will be more puzzling than they are worth
dixon had not much to tell about the higginses
her memory had an aristocratic bias and was very treacherous whenever she tried to recall any circumstance connected with those below her in life
nicholas was very well she believed
he had been several times at the house asking for news of miss margaretthe only person who ever did ask except once mr thornton
and mary
oh
of course she was very well a great stout slatternly thing
she did hear or perhaps it was only a dream of hers though it would be strange if she had dreamt of such people as the higginses that mary had gone to work at mr thorntons mill because her father wished her to know how to cook but what nonsense that could mean she didnt know
margaret rather agreed with her that the story was incoherent enough to be like a dream
still it was pleasant to have some one now with whom she could talk of milton and milton people
dixon was not overfond of the subject rather wishing to leave that part of her life in shadow
she liked much more to dwell upon speeches of mr bells which had suggested an idea to her of what was really his intentionmaking margaret his heiress
but her young lady gave her no encouragement nor in any way gratified her insinuating enquiries however disguised in the form of suspicions or assertions
all this time margaret had a strange undefined longing to hear that mr bell had gone to pay one of his business visits to milton for it had been well understood between them at the time of their conversation at helstone that the explanation she had desired should only be given to mr thornton by word of mouth and even in that manner should be in nowise forced upon him
mr bell was no great correspondent but he wrote from time to time long or short letters as the humour took him and although margaret was not conscious of any definite hope on receiving them yet she always put away his notes with a little feeling of disappointment
he was not going to milton he said nothing about it at any rate
well
she must be patient
sooner or later the mists would be cleared away
mr bells letters were hardly like his usual self they were short and complaining with every now and then a little touch of bitterness that was unusual
he did not look forward to the future he rather seemed to regret the past and be weary of the present
margaret fancied that he could not be well but in answer to some enquiry of hers as to his health he sent her a short note saying there was an oldfashioned complaint called the spleen that he was suffering from that and it was for her to decide if it was more mental or physical but that he should like to indulge himself in grumbling without being obliged to send a bulletin every time
in consequence of this note margaret made no more enquiries about his health
one day edith let out accidentally a fragment of a conversation which she had had with mr bell when he was last in london which possessed margaret with the idea that he had some notion of taking her to pay a visit to her brother and new sisterinlaw at cadiz in the autumn
she questioned and crossquestioned edith till the latter was weary and declared that there was nothing more to remember all he had said was that he halfthought he should go and hear for himself what frederick had to say about the mutiny and that it would be a good opportunity for margaret to become acquainted with her new sisterinlaw that he always went somewhere during the long vacation and did not see why he should not go to spain as well as anywhere else
that was all
edith hoped margaret did not want to leave them that she was so anxious about all this
and then having nothing else particular to do she cried and said that she knew she cared much more for margaret than margaret did for her
margaret comforted her as well as she could but she could hardly explain to her how this idea of spain mere chteau en espagne as it might be charmed and delighted her
edith was in the mood to think that any pleasure enjoyed away from her was a tacit affront or at best a proof of indifference
so margaret had to keep her pleasure to herself and could only let it escape by the safetyvalve of asking dixon when she dressed for dinner if she would not like to see master frederick and his new wife very much indeed
shes a papist miss isnt she  i believeoh yes certainly said margaret a little damped for an instant at this recollection
and they live in a popish country  yes  then im afraid i must say that my soul is dearer to me than even master frederick his own dear self
i should be in a perpetual terror miss lest i should be converted  oh said margaret i do not know that i am going and if i go i am not such a fine lady as to be unable to travel without you
no
dear old dixon you shall have a long holiday if we go
but im afraid it is a long if  now dixon did not like this speech
in the first place she did not like margarets trick of calling her dear old dixon whenever she was particularly demonstrative
she knew that miss hale was apt to call all people that she liked old as a sort of term of endearment but dixon always winced away from the application of the word to herself who being not much past fifty was she thought in the very prime of life
secondly she did not like being so easily taken at her word she had with all her terror a lurking curiosity about spain the inquisition and popish mysteries
so after clearing her throat as if to show her willingness to do away with difficulties she asked miss hale whether she thought if she took care never to see a priest or enter into one of their churches there would be so very much danger of her being converted
master frederick to be sure had gone over unaccountably
i fancy it was love that first predisposed him to conversion said margaret sighing
indeed miss said dixon well
i can preserve myself from priests and from churches but love steals in unawares
i think its as well i should not go  margaret was afraid of letting her mind run too much upon this spanish plan
but it took off her thoughts from too impatiently dwelling upon her desire to have all explained to mr thornton
mr bell appeared for the present to be stationary at oxford and to have no immediate purpose of going to milton and some secret restraint seemed to hang over margaret and prevent her from even asking or alluding again to any probability of such a visit on his part
nor did she feel at liberty to name what edith had told her of the idea he had entertainedit might be but for five minutesof going to spain
he had never named it at helstone during all that sunny day of leisure it was very probably but the fancy of a momentbut if it were true what a bright outlet it would be from the monotony of her present life which was beginning to fall upon her
one of the great pleasures of margarets life at this time was in ediths boy
he was the pride and plaything of both father and mother as long as he was good but he had a strong will of his own and as soon as he burst out into one of his stormy passions edith would throw herself back in despair and fatigue and sigh out oh dear what shall i do with him
do margaret please ring the bell for hanley  but margaret almost liked him better in these manifestations of character than in his good bluesashed moods
she would carry him off into a room where they two alone battled it out she with a firm power which subdued him into peace while every sudden charm and wile she possessed was exerted on the side of right until he would rub his little hot and tearsmeared face all over hers kissing and caressing till he often fell asleep in her arms or on her shoulder
those were margarets sweetest moments
they gave her a taste of the feeling that she believed would be denied to her for ever
mr henry lennox added a new and not disagreeable element to the course of the household life by his frequent presence
margaret thought him colder if more brilliant than formerly but there were strong intellectual tastes and much and varied knowledge which gave flavour to the otherwise rather insipid conversation
margaret saw glimpses in him of a slight contempt for his brother and sisterinlaw and for their mode of life which he seemed to consider as frivolous and purposeless
he once or twice spoke to his brother in margarets presence in a pretty sharp tone of enquiry as to whether he meant entirely to relinquish his profession and on captain lennoxs reply that he had quite enough to live upon she had seen mr lennoxs curl of the lip as he said and is that all you live for  but the brothers were much attached to each other in the way that any two persons are when the one is cleverer and always leads the other and this last is patiently content to be led
mr lennox was pushing on in his profession cultivating with profound calculation all those connections that might eventually be of service to him keensighted farseeing intelligent sarcastic and proud
since the one long conversation relating to fredericks affairs which she had with him the first evening in mr bells presence she had had no great intercourse with him further than that which arose out of their close relations with the same household
but this was enough to wear off the shyness on her side and any symptoms of mortified pride and vanity on his
they met continually of course but she thought that he rather avoided being alone with her she fancied that he as well as she perceived that they had drifted strangely apart from their former anchorage side by side in many of their opinions and all their tastes
and yet when he had spoken unusually well or with remarkable epigrammatic point she felt that his eye sought the expression of her countenance first of all if but for an instant and that in the family intercourse which constantly threw them together her opinion was the one to which he listened with a deferencethe more complete because it was reluctantly paid and concealed as much as possible
neer to be found again      my own my fathers friend
i cannot part with thee
i neer have shown thou neer hast known       how dear thou art to me               anon
the elements of the dinnerparties which mrs lennox gave were these her friends contributed the beauty captain lennox the easy knowledge of the subjects of the day and mr henry lennox and the sprinkling of rising men who were received as his friends brought the wit the cleverness the keen and extensive knowledge of which they knew well enough how to avail themselves without seeming pedantic or burdening the rapid flow of conversation
these dinners were delightful but even here margarets dissatisfaction found her out
every talent every feeling every acquirement nay even every tendency towards virtue was used up as materials for fireworks the hidden sacred fire exhausted itself in sparkle and crackle
they talked about art in a merely sensuous way dwelling on outside effects instead of allowing themselves to learn what it has to teach
they lashed themselves up into an enthusiasm about high subjects in company and never thought about them when they were alone they squandered their capabilities of appreciation into a mere flow of appropriate words
one day after the gentlemen had come up into the drawingroom mr lennox drew near to margaret and addressed her in almost the first voluntary words he had spoken to her since she had returned to live in harley street
you did not look pleased at what shirley was saying at dinner  didnt i
my face must be very expressive replied margaret
it always was
it has not lost the trick of being eloquent  i did not like said margaret hastily his way of advocating what he knew to be wrongso glaringly wrongeven in jest  but it was very clever
how every word told
did you remember the happy epithets  yes  and despise them you would like to add
pray dont scruple though he is my friend  there
that is the exact tone in you thatshe stopped short
he listened for a moment to see if she would finish her sentence but she only reddened and turned away before she did so however she heard him say in a very low clear voice  if my tones or modes of thought are what you dislike will you do me the justice to tell me so and so give me the chance of learning to please you  all these weeks there was no intelligence of mr bells going to milton
he had spoken of it at helstone as of a journey which he might have to take in a very short time from then but he must have transacted his business by writing
margaret thought ere now and she knew that if he could he would avoid going to a place which he disliked and moreover would little understand the secret importance which she affixed to the explanation that could only be given by word of mouth
she knew that he would feel that it was necessary that it should be done but whether in summer autumn or winter it would signify very little
it was now august and there had been no mention of the spanish journey to which he had alluded to edith and margaret tried to reconcile herself to the fading away of this illusion
but one morning she received a letter saying that next week he meant to come up to town he wanted to see her about a plan which he had in his head and moreover he intended to treat himself to a little doctoring as he had begun to come round to her opinion that it would be pleasanter to think that his health was more in fault than he when he found himself irritable and cross
there was altogether a tone of forced cheerfulness in the letter as margaret noticed afterwards but at the time her attention was taken up by ediths exclamations
coming up to town
oh dear
and i am so worn out by the heat that i dont believe i have strength enough in me for another dinner
besides everybody has left but our dear stupid selves who cant settle where to go to
there would be nobody to meet him  im sure he would much rather come and dine with us quite alone than with the most agreeable strangers you could pick up
besides if he is not well he wont wish for invitations
i am glad he has owned it at last
i was sure he was ill from the whole tone of his letters and yet he would not answer me when i asked him and i had no third person to whom i could apply for news  oh
he is not very ill or he would not think of spain  he never mentions spain  no
but his plan that is to be proposed evidently relates to that
but would you really go in such weather as this  oh it will get cooler every day
yes
think of it
i am only afraid i have thought and wished too muchin that absorbing wilful way which is sure to be disappointedor else gratified to the letter while in the spirit it gives no pleasure  but thats superstitious im sure margaret  no i dont think it is
only it ought to warn me and check me from giving way to such passionate wishes
it is a sort of give me children or else i die im afraid my cry is let me go to cadiz or else i die  my dear margaret
youll be persuaded to stay there and then what shall i do
oh
i wish i could find somebody for you to marry here that i could be sure of you  i shall never marry  nonsense and double nonsense
why as sholto says youre such an attraction to the house that he knows ever so many men who will be glad to visit here next year for your sake  margaret drew herself up haughtily
do you know edith i sometimes think your corfu life has taught you  well  just a shade or two of coarseness  edith began to sob so bitterly and to declare so vehemently that margaret had lost all love for her and no longer looked upon her as a friend that margaret came to think that she had expressed too harsh an opinion for the relief of her own wounded pride and ended by being ediths slave for the rest of the day while that little lady overcome by wounded feeling lay like a victim on the sofa heaving occasionally a profound sigh till at last she fell asleep
mr bell did not make his appearance even on the day to which he had for a second time deferred his visit
the next morning there came a letter from wallis his servant stating that his master had not been feeling well for some time which had been the true reason of his putting off his journey and that at the very time when he should have set out for london he had been seized with an apoplectic fit it was indeed wallis added the opinion of the medical menthat he could not survive the night and more than probable that by the time miss hale received this letter his poor master would be no more
margaret received this letter at breakfasttime and turned very pale as she read it then silently putting into ediths hands she left the room
edith was terribly shocked as she read it and cried in a sobbing frightened childish way much to her husbands distress
mrs shaw was breakfasting in her own room and upon him devolved the task of reconciling his wife to the near contact into which she seemed to be brought with death for the first time that she could remember in her life
here was a man who was to have dined with them today lying dead or dying instead
it was some time before she could think of margaret
then she started up and followed her upstairs into her room
dixon was packing up a few toilette articles and margaret was hastily putting on her bonnet shedding tears all the time and her hands trembling so that she could hardly tie the strings
oh dear margaret
how shocking
what are you doing
are you going out
sholto would telegraph or do anything you like  i am going to oxford
there is a train in halfanhour
dixon has offered to go with me but i could have gone by myself
i must see him again
besides he may be better and want some care
he has been like a father to me
dont stop me edith  but i must
mamma wont like it at all
come and ask her about it margaret
you dont know where youre going
i should not mind if he had a house of his own but in his fellows rooms
come to mamma and do ask her before you go
it will not take a minute  margaret yielded and lost her train
in the suddenness of the event mrs shaw became bewildered and hysterical and so the precious time slipped by
but there was another train in a couple of hours and after various discussions on propriety and impropriety it was decided that captain lennox should accompany margaret as the one thing to which she was constant was her resolution to go alone or otherwise by the next train whatever might be said of the propriety or impropriety of the step
her fathers friend her own friend was lying at the point of death and the thought of this came upon her with such vividness that she was surprised herself at the firmness with which she asserted something of her right to independence of action and five minutes before the time of starting she found herself sitting in a railway carriage opposite to captain lennox
it was always a comfort to her to think that she had gone though it was only to hear that he had died in the night
she saw the rooms that he had occupied and associated them ever after most fondly in her memory with the idea of her father and his one cherished and faithful friend
they had promised edith before starting that if all had ended as they feared they would return to dinner so that long lingering look around the room in which her father had died had to be interrupted and a quiet farewell taken of the kind old face that had so often come out with pleasant words and merry quips and cranks
captain lennox fell asleep on their journey home and margaret could cry at leisure and bethink her of this fatal year and all the woes it had brought to her
no sooner was she fully aware of one loss than another camenot to supersede her grief for the one before but to reopen wounds and feelings scarcely healed
but at the sound of the tender voices of her aunt and edith of merry little sholtos glee at her arrival and at the sight of the welllighted rooms with their mistress pretty in her paleness and her eager sorrowful interest margaret roused herself from her heavy trance of almost superstitious hopelessness and began to feel that even around her joy and gladness might gather
she had ediths place on the sofa sholto was taught to carry aunt margarets cup of tea very carefully to her and by the time she went up to dress she could thank god for having spared her dear old friend a long or a painful illness
breathing tranquillity
and down the sunny beach she paces slowly     with many doubtful pauses by the way     grief hath an influence so hushed and holy               hood
is not margaret the heiress whispered edith to her husband as they were in their room alone at night after the sad journey to oxford
she had pulled his tall head down and stood upon tiptoe and implored him not to be shocked before she ventured to ask this question
captain lennox was however quite in the dark if he had ever heard he had forgotten it could not be much that a fellow of a small college had to leave but he had never wanted her to pay for her board and two hundred and fifty pounds a year was something ridiculous considering that she did not take wine
edith came down upon her feet a little bit sadder with a romance blown to pieces
a week afterwards she came prancing towards her husband and made him a low curtsey  i am right and you are wrong most noble captain
margaret has had a lawyers letter and she is residuary legateethe legacies being about two thousand pounds and the remainder about forty thousand at the present value of property in milton  indeed
and how does she take her good fortune  oh it seems she knew she was to have it all along only she had no idea it was so much
she looks very white and pale and says shes afraid of it but thats nonsense you know and will soon go off
i left mamma pouring congratulations down her throat and stole away to tell you  it seemed to be supposed by general consent that the most natural thing was to consider mr lennox henceforward as margarets legal adviser
she was so entirely ignorant of all forms of business that in nearly everything she had to refer to him
he chose out her attorney he came to her with papers to be signed
he was never so happy as when teaching her of what all these mysteries of the law were the signs and types
henry said edith one day archly do you know what i hope and expect all these long conversations with margaret will end in  no i dont said he reddening
and i desire you not to tell me  oh very well then i need not tell sholto not to ask mr montagu so often to the house  just as you choose said he with forced coolness
what you are thinking of may or may not happen but this time before i commit myself i will see my ground clear
ask whom you choose
it may not be very civil edith but if you meddle in it you will mar it
she has been very farouche with me for a long time and is only just beginning to thaw a little from her zenobia ways
she has the making of a cleopatra in her if only she were a little more pagan  for my part said edith a little maliciously i am very glad she is a christian
i know so very few  there was no spain for margaret that autumn although to the last she hoped that some fortunate occasion would call frederick to paris whither she could easily have met with a convoy
instead of cadiz she had to content herself with cromer
to that place her aunt shaw and the lennoxes were bound
they had all along wished her to accompany them and consequently with their characters they made but lazy efforts to forward her own separate wish
perhaps cromer was in one sense of the expression the best for her
she needed bodily strengthening and bracing as well as rest
among other hopes that had vanished was the hope the trust she had had that mr bell would have given mr thornton the simple facts of the family circumstances which had preceded the unfortunate accident that led to leonards death
whatever opinionhowever changed it might be from what mr thornton had once entertained she had wished it to be based upon a true understanding of what she had done and why she had done it
it would have been a pleasure to her would have given her rest on a point on which she should now all her life be restless unless she could resolve not to think upon it
it was now so long after the time of these occurrences that there was no possible way of explaining them save the one which she had lost by mr bells death
she might just submit like many another to be misunderstood but though reasoning herself into the belief that in this hers was no uncommon lot her heart did not ache the less with longing that some timeyears and years hencebefore he died at any rate he might know how much she had been tempted
she thought that she did not want to hear that all was explained to him if only she could be sure that he would know
but this wish was vain like so many others and when she had schooled herself into this conviction she turned with all her heart and strength to the life that lay immediately before her and resolved to strive and make the best of that
she used to sit long hours upon the beach gazing intently on the waves as they chafed with perpetual motion against the pebbly shoreor she looked out upon the more distant heave and sparkle against the sky and heard without being conscious of hearing the eternal psalm which went up continually
she was soothed without knowing how or why
listlessly she sat there on the ground her hands clasped round her knees while her aunt shaw did small shoppings and edith and captain lennox rode far and wide on shore and inland
the nurses sauntering on with their charges would pass and repass her and wonder in whispers what she could find to look at so long day after day
and when the family gathered at dinnertime margaret was so silent and absorbed that edith voted her moped and hailed a proposal of her husbands with great satisfaction that mr henry lennox should be asked to take cromer for a week on his return from scotland in october
but all this time for thought enabled margaret to put events in their right places as to origin and significance both as regarded her past life and her future
those hours by the seaside were not lost as any one might have seen who had had the perception to read or the care to understand the look that margarets face was gradually acquiring
mr henry lennox was excessively struck by the change
the sea has done miss hale an immense deal of good i should fancy said he when she first left the room after his arrival in their family circle
she looks ten years younger than she did in harley street  thats the bonnet i got her said edith triumphantly
i knew it would suit her the moment i saw it  i beg your pardon said mr lennox in the halfcontemptuous halfindulgent tone he generally used to edith
but i believe i know the difference between the charms of a dress and the charms of a woman
no mere bonnet would have made miss hales eyes so lustrous and yet so soft or her lips so ripe and redand her face altogether so full of peace and lightshe is like and yet morehe dropped his voicelike the margaret hale of helstone  from this time the clever and ambitious man bent all his powers to gaining margaret
he loved her sweet beauty
he saw the latent sweep of her mind which could easily he thought be led to embrace all the objects on which he had set his heart
he looked upon her fortune only as a part of the complete and superb character of herself and her position yet he was fully aware of the rise which it would immediately enable him the poor barrister to take
eventually he would earn such success and such honours as would enable him to pay her back with interest that first advance in wealth which he should owe to her
he had been to milton on business connected with her property on his return from scotland and with the quick eye of a skilled lawyer ready ever to take in and weigh contingencies he had seen that much additional value was yearly accruing to the lands and tenements which she owned in that prosperous and increasing town
he was glad to find that the present relationship between margaret and himself of client and legal adviser was gradually superseding the recollection of that unlucky mismanaged day at helstone
he had thus unusual opportunities of intimate intercourse with her besides those that arose from the connection between the families
margaret was only too willing to listen as long as he talked of milton though he had seen none of the people whom she more especially knew
it had been the tone with her aunt and cousin to speak of milton with dislike and contempt just such feelings as margaret was ashamed to remember she had expressed and felt on first going to live there
but mr lennox almost exceeded margaret in his appreciation of the character of milton and its inhabitants
their energy their power their indomitable courage in struggling and fighting their lurid vividness of existence captivated and arrested his attention
he was never tired of talking about them and had never perceived how selfish and material were too many of the ends they proposed to themselves as the result of all their mighty untiring endeavour till margaret even in the midst of her gratification had the candour to point this out as the tainting sin in so much that was noble and to be admired
still when other subjects palled upon her and she gave but short answers to many questions henry lennox found out that an enquiry as to some darkshire peculiarity of character called back the light into her eye the glow into her cheek
when they returned to town margaret fulfilled one of her seaside resolves and took her life into her own hands
before they went to cromer she had been as docile to her aunts laws as if she were still the scared little stranger who cried herself to sleep that first night in the harley street nursery
but she had learnt in those solemn hours of thought that she herself must one day answer for her own life and what she had done with it and she tried to settle that most difficult problem for woman how much was to be utterly merged in obedience to authority and how much might be set apart for freedom in working
mrs shaw was as goodtempered as could be and edith had inherited this charming domestic quality margaret herself had probably the worst temper of the three for her quick perceptions and overlively imagination made her hasty and her early isolation from sympathy had made her proud but she had an indescribable childlike sweetness of heart which made her manners even in her rarely wilful moods irresistible of old and now chastened even by what the world called her good fortune she charmed her reluctant aunt into acquiescence with her will
so margaret gained the acknowledgment of her right to follow her own ideas of duty
only dont be strongminded pleaded edith
mamma wants you to have a footman of your own and im sure youre very welcome for theyre great plagues
only to please me darling dont go and have a strong mind its the only thing i ask
footman or no footman dont be strongminded  dont be afraid edith
ill faint on your hands at the servants dinnertime the very first opportunity and then what with sholto playing with the fire and the baby crying youll begin to wish for a strongminded woman equal to any emergency  and youll not grow too good to joke and be merry  not i i shall be merrier than i have ever been now i have got my own way  and youll not go a figure but let me buy your dresses for you  indeed i mean to buy them for myself
you shall come with me if you like but no one can please me but myself  oh
i was afraid youd dress in brown and dustcolour not to show the dirt youll pick up in all those places
im glad youre going to keep one or two vanities just by way of specimens of the old adam  i am going to be just the same edith if you and my aunt could but fancy so
only as i have neither husband nor child to give me natural duties i must make myself some in addition to ordering my gowns  in the family conclave which was made up of edith her mother and her husband it was decided that perhaps all these plans of hers would only secure her the more for henry lennox
they kept her out of the way of other friends who might have been eligible sons or brothers and it was also agreed that she never seemed to take much pleasure in the society of any one but henry out of their own family
the other admirers attracted by her appearance or the reputation of her fortune were swept away by her unconscious smiling disdain into the paths frequented by other beauties less fastidious or other heiresses with a larger amount of gold
henry and she grew slowly into closer intimacy but neither he nor she were people to brook the slightest notice of their proceedings
changes at milton
here we go up up up     and here we go down down downee               nursery song
meanwhile at milton the chimneys smoked the ceaseless roar and mighty beat and dazzling whirr of machinery struggled and strove perpetually
senseless and purposeless were wood and iron and steam in their endless labours but the persistence of their monotonous work was rivalled in tireless endurance by the strong crowds who with sense and with purpose were busy and restless in seeking afterwhat
in the streets there were few loiterersnone walking for mere pleasure every mans face was set in lines of eagerness or anxiety news was sought for with fierce avidity and men jostled each other aside in the mart and in the exchange as they did in life in the deep selfishness of competition
there was gloom over the town
few came to buy and those who did were looked at suspiciously by the sellers for credit was insecure and the most stable might have their fortunes affected by the sweep in the great neighbouring port among the shipping houses
hitherto there had been no failures in milton but from the immense speculations that had come to light in making a bad end in america and yet nearer home it was known that some milton houses of business must suffer so severely that every day mens faces asked if their tongues did not what news
who is gone
how will it affect me and if two or three spoke together they dwelt rather on the names of those who were safe than dared to hint at those likely in their opinion to go for idle breath may at such times cause the downfall of some who might otherwise weather the storm and one going down drags many after
thornton is safe say they
his business is largeextending every year but such a head as he has and so prudent with all his daring then one man draws another aside and walks a little apart and with head inclined into his neighbours ear he says thorntons business is large but he has spent his profits in extending it he has no capital laid by his machinery is new within these two years and has cost himwe wont say whata word to the wise but that mr harrison was a croakera man who had succeeded to his fathers trademade fortune which he had feared to lose by altering his mode of business to any having a larger scope yet he grudged every penny made by others more daring and farsighted
but the truth was mr thornton was hard pressed
he felt it acutely in his vulnerable pointhis pride in the commercial character which he had established for himself
architect of his own fortunes he attributed this to no special merit or qualities of his own but to the power which he believed that commerce gave to every brave honest and persevering man to raise himself to a level from which he might see and read the great game of worldly success and honestly by such farsightedness command more power and influence than in any other mode of life
far away in the east and in the west where his person would never be known his name was to be regarded and his wishes to be fulfilled and his word pass like gold
that was the idea of merchantlife with which mr thornton had started
her merchants be like princes said his mother reading the text aloud as if it were a trumpetcall to invite her boy to the struggle
he was but like many othersmen women and childrenalive to distant and dead to near things
he sought to possess the influence of a name in foreign countries and faraway seasto become the head of a firm that should be known for generations and it had taken him long silent years to come even to a glimmering of what he might be now today here in his own town his own factory among his own people
he and they had led parallel livesvery close but never touchingtill the accident or so it seemed of his acquaintance with higgins
once brought face to face man to man with an individual of the masses around him and take notice out of the character of master and workman in the first instance they had each begun to recognise that we have all of us one human heart it was the fine point of the wedge and until now when the apprehension of losing his connection with two or three of the workmen whom he had so lately begun to know as menof having a plan or two which were experiments lying very close to his heart roughly nipped off without trialgave a new poignancy to the subtle fear that came over him from time to time until now he had never recognised how much and how deep was the interest he had grown of late to feel in his position of manufacturer simply because it led him into such close contact and gave him the opportunity of so much power among a race of people strange shrewd ignorant but above all full of character and strong human feeling
he reviewed his position as a milton manufacturer
the strike a year and a half agoor more for it was now untimely wintry weather in a late springthat strike when he was young and he now was oldhad prevented his completing some of the large orders he had then on hand
he had locked up a good deal of his capital in new and expensive machinery and he had also bought cotton largely for the fulfilment of these orders taken under contract
that he had not been able to complete them was owing in some degree to the utter want of skill on the part of the irish hands whom he had imported much of their work was damaged and unfit to be sent forth by a house which prided itself on turning out nothing but firstrate articles
for many months the embarrassment caused by the strike had been an obstacle in mr thorntons way and often when his eye fell on higgins he could have spoken angrily to him without any present cause just from feeling how serious was the injury that had arisen from this affair in which he was implicated
but when he became conscious of this sudden quick resentment he resolved to curb it
it would not satisfy him to avoid higgins he must convince himself that he was master over his own anger by being particularly careful to allow higgins access to him whenever the strict rules of business or mr thorntons leisure permitted
and byandbye he lost all sense of resentment in wonder how it was or could be that two men like himself and higgins living by the same trade working in their different ways at the same object could look upon each others position and duties in so strangely different a way
and thence arose that intercourse which though it might not have the effect of preventing all future clash of opinion and action when the occasion arose would at any rate enable both master and man to look upon each other with far more charity and sympathy and bear with each other more patiently and kindly
besides this improvement of feeling both mr thornton and his workmen found out their ignorance as to positive matters of fact known heretofore to one side but not to the other
but now had come one of those periods of bad trade when the market falling brought down the value of all large stocks mr thorntons fell to nearly half
no orders were coming in so he lost the interest of the capital he had locked up in machinery indeed it was difficult to get payment for the orders completed yet there was the constant drain of expenses for working the business
then the bills became due for the cotton he had purchased and money being scarce he could only borrow at exorbitant interest and yet he could not realise any of his property
but he did not despair he exerted himself day and night to foresee and to provide for all emergencies he was as calm and gentle to the women in his home as ever to the workmen in his mill he spoke not many words but they knew him by this time and many a curt decided answer was received by them rather with sympathy for the care they saw pressing upon him than with the suppressed antagonism which had formerly been smouldering and ready for hard words and hard judgments on all occasions
th measters a deal to potter him said higgins one day as he heard mr thorntons short sharp inquiry why such a command had not been obeyed and caught the sound of the suppressed sigh which he heaved in going past the room where some of the men were working
higgins and another man stopped overhours that night unknown to any one to get the neglected piece of work done and mr thornton never knew but that the overlooker to whom he had given the command in the first instance had done it himself
eh
i reckon i know whod ha been sorry for to see our measter sitting so like a piece o grey calico
th oud parson would ha fretted his womans heart out if hed seen the woeful looks i have seen on our measters face thought higgins one day as he was approaching mr thornton in marlborough street
measter said he stopping his employer in his quick resolved walk and causing that gentleman to look up with a sudden annoyed start as if his thoughts had been far away
have yo heerd aught of miss marget lately  misswho replied mr thornton
miss margetmiss haleth oud parsons daughteryo known who i mean well enoughif yoll only think a bit there was nothing disrespectful in the tone in which this was said
oh yes and suddenly the wintry frostbound look of care had left mr thorntons face as if some soft summer gale had blown all anxiety away from his mind and though his mouth was as much compressed as before his eyes smiled out benignly on his questioner
shes my landlord now you know higgins
i hear of her through her agent here every now and then
shes well and among friendsthank you higgins that thank you lingered after the other words and yet came with so much warmth of feeling let in a new light to the acute higgins
it might be but a willothwisp but he thought he would follow it and ascertain whither it would lead him
and shes not getten married measter  not yet the face was cloudy once more
there is some talk of it as i understand with a connection of the family  then shell not be for coming to milton again i reckon  no  stop a minute measter then going up confidentially close he said is th young gentleman cleared he enforced the depth of his intelligence by a wink of the eye which only made things more mysterious to mr thornton
th young gentleman i meanmaster frederick they caed himher brother as was over here yo known  over here  ay to be sure at th missuss death
yo need na be feared of my telling for mary and me we knowed it all along only we held our peace for we got it through mary working in th house  and he was over
it was her brother  sure enough and i reckoned yo knowed it or id never ha let on
yo knowed she had a brother  yes i know all about him
and he was over at mrs hales death  nay
im not going for to tell more
ive maybe getten them into mischief already for they kept it very close
i nobbut wanted to know if theyd getten him cleared  not that i know of
i know nothing
i only hear of miss hale now as my landlord and through her lawyer  he broke off from higgins to follow the business on which he had been bent when the latter first accosted him leaving higgins baffled in his endeavour
it was her brother said mr thornton to himself
i am glad
i may never see her again but it is a comforta reliefto know that much
i knew she could not be unmaidenly and yet i yearned for conviction
now i am glad  it was a little golden thread running through the dark web of his present fortunes which were growing ever gloomier and more gloomy
his agent had largely trusted a house in the american trade which went down along with several others just at this time like a pack of cards the fall of one compelling other failures
what were mr thorntons engagements
could he stand
night after night he took books and papers into his own private room and sate up there long after the family were gone to bed
he thought no one knew of this occupation of the hours he should have spent in sleep
one morning when daylight was stealing in through the crevices of his shutters and he had never been in bed and in hopeless indifference of mind was thinking that he could do without the hour or two of rest which was all that he should be able to take before the stir of daily labour began again the door of his room opened and his mother stood there dressed as she had been the day before
she had never laid herself down to slumber any more than he
their eyes met
their faces were cold and rigid and wan from long watching
mother
why are you not in bed  son john said she do you think i can sleep with an easy mind while you keep awake full of care
you have not told me what your trouble is but sore trouble you have had these many days past  trade is bad  and you dread  i dread nothing replied he drawing up his head and holding it erect
i know that no man will suffer by me
that was my anxiety  but how do you stand
shall youwill it be a failure her steady voice trembling in an unwonted manner
not a failure
i must give up business but i pay all men
i might redeem myselfi am sorely tempted  how
oh john
keep up your nametry all risks for that
how redeem it  by a speculation offered to me but full of risk but if successful placing me high above watermark so that no one need ever know the strait i am in
still if it fails  and if it fails said she advancing and laying her hand on his arm her eyes full of eager light
she held her breath to hear the end of his speech
honest men are ruined by a rogue said he gloomily
as i stand now my creditors money is safeevery farthing of it but i dont know where to find my ownit may be all gone and i penniless at this moment
therefore it is my creditors money that i should risk  but if it succeeded they need never know
is it so desperate a speculation
i am sure it is not or you would never have thought of it
if it succeeded  i should be a rich man and my peace of conscience would be gone  why
you would have injured no one  no but i should have run the risk of ruining many for my own paltry aggrandisement
mother i have decided
you wont much grieve over our leaving this house shall you dear mother  no
but to have you other than what you are will break my heart
what can you do  be always the same john thornton in whatever circumstances endeavouring to do right and making great blunders and then trying to be brave in setting to afresh
but it is hard mother
i have worked and planned
i have discovered new powers in my situation too lateand now all is over
i am too old to begin again with the same heart
it is hard mother  he turned away from her and covered his face with his hands
i cant think said she with gloomy defiance in her tone how it comes about
here is my boygood son just man tender heartand he fails in all he sets his mind upon he finds a woman to love and she cares no more for his affection than if he had been a common man he labours and his labour comes to nought
other people grow rich and hold their paltry names high and dry above shame  shame never touched me said he in a low tone but she went on
i sometimes have wondered where justice was gone to and now i dont believe there is such a thing in the worldnow you are come to this you my own john thornton though you and i may be beggars togethermy own dear son  she fell upon his neck and kissed him through her tears
mother said he holding her gently in his arms who has sent me my lot in life both of good and evil  she shook her head
she would have nothing to do with religion just then
mother he went on seeing that she would not speak
i too have been rebellious but im striving to be so no longer
help me as you helped me when i was a child
then you said many good wordswhen my father died and we were sometimes sorely short of comfortswhich we shall never be now you said brave noble trustful words then mother which i have never forgotten though they may have lain dormant
speak to me again in the old way mother
do not let us have to think that the world has too much hardened our hearts
if you would say the old good words it would make me feel something of the pious simplicity of my childhood
i say them to myself but they would come differently from you remembering all the cares and trials you have had to bear  i have had a many said she sobbing but none so sore as this
to see you cast down from your rightful place
i could say it for myself john but not for you
not for you
god has seen fit to be very hard on you very  she shook with the sobs that come so convulsively when an old person weeps
the silence around her struck her at last and she quieted herself to listen
no sound
she looked
her son sate by the table his arms thrown half across it his head bent face downwards
oh john she said and she lifted his face up
such a strange pallid look of gloom was on it that for a moment it struck her that this look was the forerunner of death but as the rigidity melted out of the countenance and the natural colour returned and she saw that he was himself once again all worldly mortification sank to nothing before the consciousness of the great blessing that he himself by his simple existence was to her
she thanked god for this and this alone with a fervour that swept away all rebellious feelings from her mind
he did not speak readily but he went and opened the shutters and let the ruddy light of dawn flood the room
but the wind was in the east the weather was piercing cold as it had been for weeks there would be no demand for light summer goods this year
that hope for the revival of trade must utterly be given up
it was a great comfort to have had this conversation with his mother and to feel sure that however they might henceforward keep silence on all these anxieties they yet understood each others feelings and were if not in harmony at least in discord with each other in their way of viewing them
fannys husband was vexed at thorntons refusal to take any share in the speculation which he had offered to him and withdrew from any possibility of being supposed able to assist him with the ready money which indeed the speculator needed for his own venture
there was nothing for it at last but that which mr thornton had dreaded for many weeks he had to give up the business in which he had been so long engaged with so much honour and success and look out for a subordinate situation
marlborough mills and the adjacent dwelling were held under a long lease they must if possible be relet
there was an immediate choice of situations offered to mr thornton
mr hamper would have been only too glad to have secured him as a steady and experienced partner for his son whom he was setting up with a large capital in a neighbouring town but the young man was halfeducated as regarded information and wholly uneducated as regarded any other responsibility than that of getting money and brutalised both as to his pleasures and his pains
mr thornton declined having any share in a partnership which would frustrate what few plans he had that survived the wreck of his fortunes
he would sooner consent to be only a manager where he could have a certain degree of power beyond the mere moneygetting part than have to fall in with the tyrannical humours of a moneyed partner with whom he felt sure that he should quarrel in a few months
so he waited and stood on one side with profound humility as the news swept through the exchange of the enormous fortune which his brotherinlaw had made by his daring speculation
it was a nine days wonder
success brought with it its worldly consequence of extreme admiration
no one was considered so wise and farseeing as mr watson
meeting again
bear up brave heart
we will be calm and strong     sure we can master eyes or cheek or tongue     nor let the smallest telltale sign appear     she ever was and is and will be dear               rhyming play
it was a hot summers evening
edith came into margarets bedroom the first time in her habit the second ready dressed for dinner
no one was there at first the next time edith found dixon laying out margarets dress on the bed but no margaret
edith remained to fidget about
oh dixon
not those horrid blue flowers to that dead goldcoloured gown
what taste
wait a minute and i will bring you some pomegranate blossoms  its not a dead goldcolour maam
its a strawcolour
and blue always goes with strawcolour but edith had brought the brilliant scarlet flowers before dixon had got half through her remonstrance
where is miss hale asked edith as soon as she had tried the effect of the garniture
i cant think she went on pettishly how my aunt allowed her to get into such rambling habits in milton
im sure im always expecting to hear of her having met with something horrible among all those wretched places she pokes herself into
i should never dare to go down some of those streets without a servant
theyre not fit for ladies  dixon was still huffed about her despised taste so she replied rather shortly  its no wonder to my mind when i hear ladies talk such a deal about ladiesand when theyre such fearful delicate dainty ladies tooi say its no wonder to me that there are no longer any saints on earth  oh margaret
here you are
i have been so wanting you
but how your cheeks are flushed with the heat poor child
but only think what that tiresome henry has done really he exceeds brotherinlaws limits
just when my party was made up so beautifullyfitted in so precisely for mr colthurstthere has henry come with an apology it is true and making use of your name for an excuse and asked me if he may bring that mr thornton of miltonyour tenant you knowwho is in london about some law business
it will spoil my number quite  i dont mind dinner
i dont want any said margaret in a low voice
dixon can get me a cup of tea here and i will be in the drawingroom by the time you come up
i shall really be glad to lie down  no no
that will never do
you do look wretchedly white to be sure but that is just the heat and we cant do without you possibly
those flowers a little lower dixon
they look glorious flames margaret in your black hair
you know we planned you to talk about milton to mr colthurst
oh
to be sure
and this man comes from milton
i believe it will be capital after all
mr colthurst can pump him well on all the subjects in which he is interested and it will be great fun to trace out your experiences and this mr thorntons wisdom in mr colthursts next speech in the house
really i think it is a happy hit of henrys
i asked him if he was a man one would be ashamed of and he replied not if youve any sense in you my little sister so i suppose he is able to sound his hs which is not a common darkshire accomplishmenteh margaret  mr
lennox did not say why mr thornton was come up to town
was it law business connected with the property asked margaret in a constrained voice
oh
hes failed or something of the kind that henry told you of that day you had such a headachewhat was it
there thats capital dixon
miss hale does us credit does she not
i wish i was as tall as a queen and as brown as a gipsy margaret  but about mr thornton  oh
i really have such a terrible head for law business
henry will like nothing better than to tell you all about it
i know the impression he made upon me was that mr thornton is very badly off and a very respectable man and that im to be very civil to him and as i did not know how i came to you to ask you to help me
and now come down with me and rest on the sofa for a quarter of an hour  the privileged brotherinlaw came early and margaret reddening as she spoke began to ask him the questions she wanted to hear answered about mr thornton
he came up about this subletting the propertymarlborough mills and the house and premises adjoining i mean
he is unable to keep it on and there are deeds and leases to be looked over and agreements to be drawn up
i hope edith will receive him properly but she was rather put out as i could see by the liberty i had taken in begging for an invitation for him
but i thought you would like to have some attention shown him and one would be particularly scrupulous in paying every respect to a man who is going down in the world he had dropped his voice to speak to margaret by whom he was sitting but as he ended he sprang up and introduced mr thornton who had that moment entered to edith and captain lennox
margaret looked with an anxious eye at mr thornton while he was thus occupied
it was considerably more than a year since she had seen him and events had occurred to change him much in that time
his fine figure yet bore him above the common height of men and gave him a distinguished appearance from the ease of motion which arose out of it and was natural to him but his face looked older and careworn yet a noble composure sate upon it which impressed those who had just been hearing of his changed position with a sense of inherent dignity and manly strength
he was aware from the first glance he had given round the room that margaret was there he had seen her intent look of occupation as she listened to mr henry lennox and he came up to her with the perfectly regulated manner of an old friend
with his first calm words a vivid colour flashed into her cheeks which never left them again during the evening
she did not seem to have much to say to him
she disappointed him by the quiet way in which she asked what seemed to him to be the merely necessary questions respecting her old acquaintances in milton but others came inmore intimate in the house than heand he fell into the background where he and mr lennox talked together from time to time
you think miss hale looking well said mr lennox dont you
milton didnt agree with her i imagine for when she first came to london i thought i had never seen any one so much changed
tonight she is looking radiant
but she is much stronger
last autumn she was fatigued with a walk of a couple of miles
on friday evening we walked up to hampstead and back
yet on saturday she looked as well as she does now  we who
they two alone
mr colthurst was a very clever man and a rising member of parliament
he had a quick eye at discerning character and was struck by a remark which mr thornton made at dinnertime
he enquired from edith who that gentleman was and rather to her surprise she found from the tone of his indeed that mr thornton of milton was not such an unknown name to him as she had imagined it would be
her dinner was going off well
henry was in good humour and brought out his dry caustic wit admirably
mr thornton and mr colthurst found one or two mutual subjects of interest which they could only touch upon then reserving them for more private afterdinner talk
margaret looked beautiful in the pomegranate flowers and if she did lean back in her chair and speak but little edith was not annoyed for the conversation flowed on smoothly without her
margaret was watching mr thorntons face
he never looked at her so she might study him unobserved and note the changes which even this short time had wrought in him
only at some unexpected mot of mr lennoxs his face flashed out into the old look of intense enjoyment the merry brightness returned to his eyes the lips just parted to suggest the brilliant smile of former days and for an instant his glance instinctively sought hers as if he wanted her sympathy
but when their eyes met his whole countenance changed he was grave and anxious once more and he resolutely avoided even looking near her again during dinner
there were only two ladies beside their own party and as these were occupied in conversation by her aunt and edith when they went up into the drawingroom margaret languidly employed herself about some work
presently the gentlemen came up mr colthurst and mr thornton in close conversation
mr lennox drew near to margaret and said in a low voice  i really think edith owes me thanks for my contribution to her party
youve no idea what an agreeable sensible fellow this tenant of yours is
he has been the very man to give colthurst all the facts he wanted coaching in
i cant conceive how he contrived to mismanage his affairs  with his powers and opportunities you would have succeeded said margaret
he did not quite relish the tone in which she spoke although the words but expressed a thought which had passed through his own mind
as he was silent they caught a swell in the sound of conversation going on near the fireplace between mr colthurst and mr thornton
i assure you i heard it spoken of with great interestcuriosity as to its result perhaps i should rather say
i heard your name frequently mentioned during my short stay in the neighbourhood then they lost some words and when next they could hear mr thornton was speaking
i have not the elements for popularityif they spoke of me in that way they were mistaken
i fall slowly into new projects and i find it difficult to let myself be known even by those whom i desire to know and with whom i would fain have no reserve
yet even with all these drawbacks i felt that i was on the right path and that starting from a kind of friendship with one i was becoming acquainted with many
the advantages were mutual we were both unconsciously and consciously teaching each other  you say were i trust you are intending to pursue the same course  i must stop colthurst said henry lennox hastily
and by an abrupt yet apropos question he turned the current of the conversation so as not to give mr thornton the mortification of acknowledging his want of success and consequent change of position
but as soon as the newlystarted subject had come to a close mr thornton resumed the conversation just where it had been interrupted and gave mr colthurst the reply to his inquiry
i have been unsuccessful in business and have had to give up my position as a master
i am on the lookout for a situation in milton where i may meet with employment under some one who will be willing to let me go along my own way in such matters as these
i can depend upon myself for having no goahead theories that i would rashly bring into practice
my only wish is to have the opportunity of cultivating some intercourse with the hands beyond the mere cash nexus but it might be the point archimedes sought from which to move the earth to judge by the importance attached to it by some of our manufacturers who shake their heads and look grave as soon as i name the one or two experiments that i should like to try  you call them experiments i notice said mr colthurst with a delicate increase of respect in his manner
because i believe them to be such
i am not sure of the consequences that may result from them
but i am sure they ought to be tried
i have arrived at the conviction that no mere institutions however wise and however much thought may have been required to organise and arrange them can attach class to class as they should be attached unless the working out of such institutions bring the individuals of the different classes into actual personal contact
such intercourse is the very breath of life
a working man can hardly be made to feel and know how much his employer may have laboured in his study at plans for the benefit of his workpeople
a complete plan emerges like a piece of machinery apparently fitted for every emergency
but the hands accept it as they do machinery without understanding the intense mental labour and forethought required to bring it to such perfection
but i would take an idea the working out of which would necessitate personal intercourse it might not go well at first but at every hitch interest would be felt by an increasing number of men and at last its success in working come to be desired by all as all had borne a part in the formation of the plan and even then i am sure that it would lose its vitality cease to be living as soon as it was no longer carried on by that sort of common interest which invariably makes people find means and ways of seeing each other and becoming acquainted with each others characters and persons and even tricks of temper and modes of speech
we should understand each other better and ill venture to say we should like each other more  and you think they may prevent recurrence of strikes  not at all
my utmost expectation only goes as far as thisthat they may render strikes not the bitter venomous sources of hatred they have hitherto been
a more hopeful man might imagine that a closer and more genial intercourse between classes might do away with strikes
but i am not a hopeful man  suddenly as if a new idea had struck him he crossed over to where margaret was sitting and began without preface as if he knew she had been listening to all that had passed  miss hale i had a roundrobin from some of my meni suspect in higgins handwritingstating their wish to work for me if ever i was in a position to employ men again on my own behalf
that was good wasnt it  yes
just right
i am glad of it said margaret looking up straight into his face with her speaking eyes and then dropping them under his eloquent glance
he gazed back at her for a minute as if he did not know exactly what he was about
then sighed and saying i knew you would like it he turned away and never spoke to her again until he bid her a formal good night  as mr lennox took his departure margaret said with a blush that she could not repress and with some hesitation  can i speak to you tomorrow
i want your help aboutsomething  certainly
i will come at whatever time you name
you cannot give me a greater pleasure than by making me of any use
at eleven
very well  his eye brightened with exultation
how she was learning to depend upon him
it seemed as if any day now might give him the certainty without having which he had determined never to offer to her again
pack clouds away      for joy or grief for hope or fear     for all hereafter as for here     in peace or strife in storm or shine               anon
edith went about on tiptoe and checked sholto in all loud speaking that next morning as if any sudden noise would interrupt the conference that was taking place in the drawingroom
two oclock came and they still sate there with closed doors
then there was a mans footstep running down stairs and edith peeped out of the drawingroom
well henry said she with a look of interrogation
well said he rather shortly
come in to lunch  no thank you i cant
ive lost too much time here already  then its not all settled said edith despondingly
no
not at all
it never will be settled if the it is what i conjecture you mean
that will never be edith so give up thinking about it  but it would be so nice for us all pleaded edith
i should always feel comfortable about the children if i had margaret settled down near to me
as it is i am always afraid of her going off to cadiz  i will try when i marry to look out for a young lady who has a knowledge of the management of children
that is all i can do
miss hale will not have me
and i shall not ask her  then what have you been talking about  a thousand things you would not understand investments and leases and value of land  oh go away if thats all
you and she will be unbearably stupid if youve been talking all this time about such weary things  very well
im coming again tomorrow and bringing mr thornton with me to have some more talk with miss hale  mr
thornton
what has he to do with it  he is miss hales tenant said mr lennox turning away
and he wishes to give up his lease  oh
very well
i cant understand details so dont give them me  the only detail i want you to understand is to let us have the back drawingroom undisturbed as it was today
in general the children and servants are so in and out that i can never get any business satisfactorily explained and the arrangements we have to make tomorrow are of importance  no one ever knew why mr lennox did not keep to his appointment on the following day
mr thornton came true to his time and after keeping him waiting for nearly an hour margaret came in looking very white and anxious
she began hurriedly  i am so sorry mr lennox is not herehe could have done it so much better than i can
he is my adviser in this  i am sorry that i came if it troubles you
shall i go to mr lennoxs chambers and try and find him  no thank you
i wanted to tell you how grieved i was to find that i am to lose you as a tenant
but mr lennox says things are sure to brighten  mr
lennox knows little about it said mr thornton quietly
happy and fortunate in all a man cares for he does not understand what it is to find oneself no longer youngyet thrown back to the startingpoint which requires the hopeful energy of youthto feel one half of life gone and nothing donenothing remaining of wasted opportunity but the bitter recollection that it has been
miss hale would rather not hear mr lennoxs opinion of my affairs
those who are happy and successful themselves are too apt to make light of the misfortunes of others  you are unjust said margaret gently
mr
lennox has only spoken of the great probability which he believes there to be of your redeemingyour more than redeeming what you have lostdont speak till i have endedpray dont and collecting herself once more she went on rapidly turning over some law papers and statement of accounts in a trembling hurried manner
oh
here it is
andhe drew me out a proposali wish he was here to explain itshowing that if you would take some money of mine eighteen hundred and fiftyseven pounds lying just at this moment unused in the bank and bringing me in only two and a half per centyou could pay me much better interest and might go on working marlborough mills her voice had cleared itself and become more steady
mr thornton did not speak and she went on looking for some paper on which were written down the proposals for security for she was most anxious to have it all looked upon in the light of a mere business arrangement in which the principal advantage would be on her side
while she sought for this paper her very heartpulse was arrested by the tone in which mr thornton spoke
his voice was hoarse and trembling with tender passion as he said  margaret  for an instant she looked up and then sought to veil her luminous eyes by dropping her forehead on her hands
again stepping nearer he besought her with another tremulous eager call upon her name
margaret  still lower went the head more closely hidden was the face almost resting on the table before her
he came close to her
he knelt by her side to bring his face to a level with her ear and whisperedpanted out the words  take careif you do not speaki shall claim you as my own in some strange presumptuous waysend me away at once if i must gomargaret  at that third call she turned her face still covered with her small white hands towards him and laid it on his shoulder even hiding it there and it was too delicious to feel her soft cheek against his for him to wish to see either deep blushes or loving eyes
he clasped her close
but they both kept silence
at length she murmured in a broken voice  oh mr thornton i am not good enough  not good enough
dont mock my own deep feeling of unworthiness  after a minute or two he gently disengaged her hands from her face and laid her arms as they had once before been placed to protect him from the rioters
do you remember love he murmured
and how i requited you with my insolence the next day  i remember how wrongly i spoke to youthat is all  look here
lift up your head
i have something to show you she slowly faced him glowing with beautiful shame
do you know these roses he said drawing out his pocketbook in which were treasured up some dead flowers
no she replied with innocent curiosity
did i give them to you  no
vanity you did not
you may have worn sister roses very probably  she looked at them wondering for a minute then she smiled a little as she said  they are from helstone are they not
i know the deep indentations round the leaves
oh
have you been there
when were you there  i wanted to see the place where margaret grew to what she is even at the worst time of all when i had no hope of ever calling her mine
i went there on my return from havre  you must give them to me she said trying to take them out of his hand with gentle violence
very well
only you must pay me for them  how shall i ever tell aunt shaw she whispered after some time of delicious silence
let me speak to her  oh no
i owe to herbut what will she say  i can guess
her first exclamation will be that man  hush said margaret or i shall try and show you your mothers indignant tones as she says that woman   the end

the  cult of beauty  a manual of personal hygiene
by c j s thompson  extract from preface
too much care cannot be taken of the exterior of the human body on which the general health so largely depends
the most recent discoveries in science go to prove that cleanliness with proper attention to bodily exercise is the greatest enemy to disease and decay
quackery has never been more rampant than it is today and advertised secret preparations for beautifying the person meet us at every turn
it is with the object of showing how beauty may be preserved and aided on purely hygienic principles that this work has been written the greatest secret of beauty being health   contents   quackery says mr thompson was never more rampant than it is today with regard to aids in beautifying the person his little book is based on purely hygienic principles and comprises recipes for toilet purposes which he warrants are practical and harmless these are virtues in any book of health and beauty and mr thompsons advice and guidance are we find not wanting in soundness and commonsensesaturday review   london walter scott limited paternoster square

the letters of the younger pliny
in  vols first and second series
translated with an introductory essay by john b firth ba late scholar of queens college oxford
the correspondence of pliny the younger depicts for us the everyday life of a roman gentleman in the best sense of the term
we see him practising at the bar we see him engaged in the civil magistracies at rome and in the governorship of the important province of bithynia we see him consulted by the emperor on affairs of state and occupying a definite place among the amici caesaris best of all perhaps we see him in his daily life a devoted scholar never so happy as when he is in his study laboriously seeking to perfect his style whether in verse or prose by the models of the great writers of the past and the criticisms of the friends whom he has summoned in a friendly way to hear his compositions read or recited
