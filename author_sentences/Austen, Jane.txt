volume i       emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twentyone years in the world with very little to distress or vex her
she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sisters marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period
her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection
sixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouses family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of emma
between them it was more the intimacy of sisters
even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming miss taylors judgment but directed chiefly by her own
the real evils indeed of emmas situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments
the danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her
sorrow camea gentle sorrowbut not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousnessmiss taylor married
it was miss taylors loss which first brought grief
it was on the weddingday of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance
the wedding over and the bridepeople gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening
her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost
the event had every promise of happiness for her friend
mr weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what selfdenying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black mornings work for her
the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day
she recalled her past kindnessthe kindness the affection of sixteen yearshow she had taught and how she had played with her from five years oldhow she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in healthand how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood
a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the intercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed isabellas marriage on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection
she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent wellinformed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family interested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hersone to whom she could speak every thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault
how was she to bear the changeit was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them and a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude
she dearly loved her father but he was no companion for her
he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful
the evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had not married early was much increased by his constitution and habits for having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity of mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him at any time
her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony being settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach and many a long october and november evening must be struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next visit from isabella and her husband and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again
highbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town to which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies and name did really belong afforded her no equals
the woodhouses were first in consequence there
all looked up to them
she had many acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day
it was a melancholy change and emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful
his spirits required support
he was a nervous man easily depressed fond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them hating change of every kind
matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughters marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield
emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner  poor miss taylori wish she were here again
what a pity it is that mr weston ever thought of her  i cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot
mr weston is such a goodhumoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wifeand you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own  a house of her ownbut where is the advantage of a house of her own
this is three times as largeand you have never any odd humours my dear  how often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see uswe shall be always meeting
we must begin we must go and pay wedding visit very soon  my dear how am i to get so far
randalls is such a distance
i could not walk half so far  no papa nobody thought of your walking
we must go in the carriage to be sure  the carriage
but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little wayand where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit  they are to be put into mr westons stable papa
you know we have settled all that already
we talked it all over with mr weston last night
and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughters being housemaid there
i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else
that was your doing papa
you got hannah that good place
nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned herjames is so obliged to you  i am very glad i did think of her
it was very lucky for i would not have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account and i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil prettyspoken girl i have a great opinion of her
whenever i see her she always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner and when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it
i am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great comfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see
whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know she will be hearing of us
he will be able to tell her how we all are  emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own
the backgammontable was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary
mr knightley a sensible man about seven or eightandthirty was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly connected with it as the elder brother of isabellas husband
he lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor and always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual as coming directly from their mutual connexions in london
he had returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square
it was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time
mr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good and his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were answered most satisfactorily
when this was over mr woodhouse gratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come out at this late hour to call upon us
i am afraid you must have had a shocking walk  not at all sir
it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire  but you must have found it very damp and dirty
i wish you may not catch cold  dirty sir
look at my shoes
not a speck on them  well
that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal of rain here
it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast
i wanted them to put off the wedding  by the byei have not wished you joy
being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry with my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well
how did you all behave
who cried most  ah
poor miss taylor
tis a sad business  poor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly say poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independenceat any rate it must be better to have only one to please than two  especially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature said emma playfully
that is what you have in your head i knowand what you would certainly say if my father were not by  i believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse with a sigh
i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome  my dearest papa
you do not think i could mean you or suppose mr knightley to mean you
what a horrible idea
oh no
i meant only myself
mr knightley loves to find fault with me you knowin a jokeit is all a joke
we always say what we like to one another  mr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body
emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i meant no reflection on any body
miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one
the chances are that she must be a gainer  well said emma willing to let it passyou want to hear about the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly
every body was punctual every body in their best looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen
oh no we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart and were sure of meeting every day  dear emma bears every thing so well said her father
but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for  emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles
it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said mr knightley
we should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to miss taylors advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at miss taylors time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure
every friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily married  and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma and a very considerable onethat i made the match myself
i made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place and be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would never marry again may comfort me for any thing  mr knightley shook his head at her
her father fondly replied ah
my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things for whatever you say always comes to pass
pray do not make any more matches  i promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed for other people
it is the greatest amusement in the world
and after such success you knowevery body said that mr weston would never marry again
oh dear no
mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerfulmr
weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it
oh no
mr weston certainly would never marry again
some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed and others of the son and the uncle not letting him
all manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none of it
ever since the dayabout four years agothat miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchells i made up my mind on the subject
i planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed me in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave off matchmaking  i do not understand what you mean by success said mr knightley
success supposes endeavour
your time has been properly and delicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage
a worthy employment for a young ladys mind
but if which i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards why do you talk of success
where is your merit
what are you proud of
you made a lucky guess and that is all that can be said  and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guessi pity youi thought you clevererfor depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck
there is always some talent in it
and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know that i am so entirely without any claim to it
you have drawn two pretty pictures but i think there may be a thirda something between the donothing and the doall
if i had not promoted mr westons visits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed many little matters it might not have come to any thing after all
i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that  a straightforward openhearted man like weston and a rational unaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their own concerns
you are more likely to have done harm to yourself than good to them by interference  emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part
but my dear pray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up ones family circle grievously  only one more papa only for mr elton
poor mr elton
you like mr elton papai must look about for a wife for him
there is nobody in highbury who deserves himand he has been here a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably that it would be a shame to have him single any longerand i thought when he was joining their hands today he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him
i think very well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing him a service  mr
elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him
but if you want to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come and dine with us some day
that will be a much better thing
i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him  with a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr knightley laughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much better thing
invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife
depend upon it a man of six or sevenandtwenty can take care of himself       mr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property
he had received a good education but on succeeding early in life to a small independence had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied
captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend
miss churchill however being of age and with the full command of her fortunethough her fortune bore no proportion to the familyestatewas not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it took place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill who threw her off with due decorum
it was an unsuitable connexion and did not produce much happiness
mrs weston ought to have found more in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best
she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brothers unreasonable anger nor from missing the luxuries of her former home
they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe
captain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills as making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst of the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage he was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain
from the expense of the child however he was soon relieved
the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mothers been the means of a sort of reconciliation and mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease
some scruples and some reluctance the widowerfather may be supposed to have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills and he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to improve as he could
a complete change of life became desirable
he quitted the militia and engaged in trade having brothers already established in a good way in london which afforded him a favourable opening
it was a concern which brought just employment enough
he had still a small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away
he had by that time realised an easy competenceenough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had always longed forenough to marry a woman as portionless even as miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition
it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished
he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through
he had never been an unhappy man his own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage but his second must shew him how delightful a welljudging and truly amiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen to excite gratitude than to feel it
he had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was his own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncles heir it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age
it was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his fathers assistance
his father had no apprehension of it
the aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely but it was not in mr westons nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed so deservedly dear
he saw his son every year in london and was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too
he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern
mr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life
his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved
now upon his fathers marriage it was very generally proposed as a most proper attention that the visit should take place
there was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when mrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and miss bates returned the visit
now was the time for mr frank churchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion
for a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs weston had received
i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written to mrs weston
i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed
mr woodhouse told me of it
mr woodhouse saw the letter and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life  it was indeed a highly prized letter
mrs weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured
she felt herself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her
she knew that at times she must be missed and could not think without pain of emmas losing a single pleasure or suffering an hours ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear emma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been and had sense and energy and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations
and then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield so convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr westons disposition and circumstances which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together
her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her satisfactionher more than satisfactionher cheerful enjoyment was so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity poor miss taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own
but never did she go without mr woodhouses giving a gentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor
she would be very glad to stay  there was no recovering miss taylornor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation to mr woodhouse
the compliments of his neighbours were over he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event and the weddingcake which had been a great distress to him was all eat up
his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he could never believe other people to be different from himself
what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any weddingcake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any bodys eating it
he had been at the pains of consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject
mr perry was an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr woodhouses life and upon being applied to he could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination that weddingcake might certainly disagree with manyperhaps with most people unless taken moderately
with such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the cake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone
there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs westons weddingcake in their hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it
mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way
he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked
he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinnerparties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms
fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley comprehended many such
not unfrequently through emmas persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a cardtable for him
real longstanding regard brought the westons and mr knightley and by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr woodhouses drawingroom and the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being thrown away
after these came a second set among the most comeatable of whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses
had it taken place only once a year it would have been a grievance
mrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a very old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille
she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite
her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young handsome rich nor married
miss bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect
she had never boasted either beauty or cleverness
her youth had passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible
and yet she was a happy woman and a woman whom no one named without goodwill
it was her own universal goodwill and contented temper which worked such wonders
she loved every body was interested in every bodys happiness quicksighted to every bodys merits thought herself a most fortunate creature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother and so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted for nothing
the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature her contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body and a mine of felicity to herself
she was a great talker upon little matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial communications and harmless gossip
mrs goddard was the mistress of a schoolnot of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanitybut a real honest oldfashioned boardingschool where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education without any danger of coming back prodigies
mrs goddards school was in high reputeand very deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty of wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands
it was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church
she was a plain motherly kind of woman who had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a teavisit and having formerly owed much to mr woodhouses kindness felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancywork whenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside
these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her fathers sake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston
she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated
as she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her a most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen whom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty
a very gracious invitation was returned and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion
harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody
somebody had placed her several years back at mrs goddards school and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlourboarder
this was all that was generally known of her history
she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her
she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort which emma particularly admired
she was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance
she was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smiths conversation but she found her altogether very engagingnot inconveniently shy not unwilling to talkand yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement
encouragement should be given
those soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be wasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions
the acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her
the friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort of people must be doing her harm
they were a family of the name of martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm of mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwellvery creditably she believedshe knew mr knightley thought highly of thembut they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect
she would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners
it would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking highly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers
she was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking and listening and forming all these schemes in the inbetweens that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the suppertable which always closed such parties and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware
with an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively with the real goodwill of a mind delighted with its own ideas did she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests
upon such occasions poor mr woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare
he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat
such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could with thorough selfapprobation recommend though he might constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things to say  mrs
bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs
an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome
serle understands boiling an egg better than any body
i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you seeone of our small eggs will not hurt you
miss bates let emma help you to a little bit of tarta very little bit
ours are all appletarts
you need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here
i do not advise the custard
mrs goddard what say you to half a glass of wine
a small halfglass put into a tumbler of water
i do not think it could disagree with you  emma allowed her father to talkbut supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy
the happiness of miss smith was quite equal to her intentions
miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last
harriet smiths intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing
quick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other
as a walking companion emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her
in that respect mrs westons loss had been important
her father never went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied and since mrs westons marriage her exercise had been too much confined
she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant and a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges
but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs
harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to
her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected
altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smiths being exactly the young friend she wantedexactly the something which her home required
such a friend as mrs weston was out of the question
two such could never be granted
two such she did not want
it was quite a different sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent
mrs weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem
harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful
for mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing
her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents but harriet could not tell
she was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain
emma was obliged to fancy what she likedbut she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth
harriet had no penetration
she had been satisfied to hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her and looked no farther
mrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the school in general formed naturally a great part of the conversationand but for her acquaintance with the martins of abbeymill farm it must have been the whole
but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place
emma encouraged her talkativenessamused by such a picture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of mrs martins having two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddards drawingroom and of her having an upper maid who had lived fiveandtwenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys and one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed and of mrs martins saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summerhouse in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink teaa very handsome summerhouse large enough to hold a dozen people  for some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause but as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose
she had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter a son and sons wife who all lived together but when it appeared that the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always mentioned with approbation for his great goodnature in doing something or other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin no wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she were not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever
with this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number and meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin and there was evidently no dislike to it
harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very goodhumoured and obliging
he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them and in every thing else he was so very obliging
he had his shepherds son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her
she was very fond of singing
he could sing a little himself
she believed he was very clever and understood every thing
he had a very fine flock and while she was with them he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country
she believed every body spoke well of him
his mother and sisters were very fond of him
mrs martin had told her one day and there was a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body to be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married he would make a good husband
not that she wanted him to marry
she was in no hurry at all
well done mrs martin thought emma
you know what you are about  and when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send mrs goddard a beautiful goosethe finest goose mrs goddard had ever seen
mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all the three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson to sup with her  mr
martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business
he does not read  oh yesthat is noi do not knowbut i believe he has read a good dealbut not what you would think any thing of
he reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay in one of the window seatsbut he reads all them to himself
but sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read something aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining
and i know he has read the vicar of wakefield
he never read the romance of the forest nor the children of the abbey
he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can  the next question was  what sort of looking man is mr martin  oh
not handsomenot at all handsome
i thought him very plain at first but i do not think him so plain now
one does not you know after a time
but did you never see him
he is in highbury every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston
he has passed you very often  that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name
a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity
the yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i can have nothing to do
a degree or two lower and a creditable appearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other
but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it  to be sure
oh yes
it is not likely you should ever have observed him but he knows you very well indeedi mean by sight  i have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man
i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well
what do you imagine his age to be  he was fourandtwenty the th of last june and my birthday is the rd just a fortnight and a days differencewhich is very odd  only fourandtwenty
that is too young to settle
his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry
they seem very comfortable as they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him she would probably repent it
six years hence if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own with a little money it might be very desirable  six years hence
dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old  well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence
mr martin i imagine has his fortune entirely to makecannot be at all beforehand with the world
whatever money he might come into when his father died whatever his share of the family property it is i dare say all afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though with diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet  to be sure so it is
but they live very comfortably
they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year  i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marryi mean as to being acquainted with his wifefor though his sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether objected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice
the misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates
there can be no doubt of your being a gentlemans daughter and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you  yes to be sure i suppose there are
but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do  you understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i would have you so firmly established in good society as to be independent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse
i want to see you permanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say that if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries i wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters to be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere farmers daughter without education  to be sure
yes
not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some educationand been very well brought up
however i do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife
i shall always have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth and should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well educated as me
but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman certainly i had better not visit her if i can help it  emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love
the young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriets side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own
they met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the donwell road
he was on foot and after looking very respectfully at her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion
emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin
his appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriets inclination
harriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her fathers gentleness with admiration as well as wonder
mr martin looked as if he did not know what manner was
they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose
only think of our happening to meet himhow very odd
it was quite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls
he did not think we ever walked this road
he thought we walked towards randalls most days
he has not been able to get the romance of the forest yet
he was so busy the last time he was at kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again tomorrow
so very odd we should happen to meet
well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected
what do you think of him
do you think him so very plain  he is very plain undoubtedlyremarkably plainbut that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility
i had no right to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no idea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air
i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility  to be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not so genteel as real gentlemen  i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin
at hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated well bred men
i should be surprized if after seeing them you could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creatureand rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before
do not you begin to feel that now
were not you struck
i am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner and the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated as i stood here  certainly he is not like mr knightley
he has not such a fine air and way of walking as mr knightley
i see the difference plain enough
but mr knightley is so very fine a man  mr
knightleys air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr martin with him
you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley
but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to
what say you to mr weston and mr elton
compare mr martin with either of them
compare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking of being silent
you must see the difference  oh yesthere is a great difference
but mr weston is almost an old man
mr weston must be between forty and fifty  which makes his good manners the more valuable
the older a person grows harriet the more important it is that their manners should not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness or coarseness or awkwardness becomes
what is passable in youth is detestable in later age
mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr westons time of life  there is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly
but there may be pretty good guessing
he will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss  will he indeed
that will be very bad  how much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended
he was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing elsewhich is just as it should be for a thriving man
what has he to do with books
and i have no doubt that he will thrive and be a very rich man in timeand his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us  i wonder he did not remember the bookwas all harriets answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself
she therefore said no more for some time
her next beginning was  in one respect perhaps mr eltons manners are superior to mr knightleys or mr westons
they have more gentleness
they might be more safely held up as a pattern
there is an openness a quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body likes in him because there is so much goodhumour with itbut that would not do to be copied
neither would mr knightleys downright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits him very well his figure and look and situation in life seem to allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him he would not be sufferable
on the contrary i think a young man might be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model
mr elton is goodhumoured cheerful obliging and gentle
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late
i do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be
if he means any thing it must be to please you
did not i tell you what he said of you the other day  she then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from mr elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed and smiled and said she had always thought mr elton very agreeable
mr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriets head
she thought it would be an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural and probable for her to have much merit in planning it
she feared it was what every body else must think of and predict
it was not likely however that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of harriets coming to hartfield
the longer she considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency
mr eltons situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connexions at the same time not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet
he had a comfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income for though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him as a goodhumoured wellmeaning respectable young man without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world
she had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on harriets there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy
and he was really a very pleasing young man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like
he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense withbut the girl who could be gratified by a robert martins riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr eltons admiration
i do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston said mr knightley of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing  a bad thing
do you really think it a bad thingwhy so  i think they will neither of them do the other any good  you surprize me
emma must do harriet good and by supplying her with a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good
i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure
how very differently we feelnot think they will do each other any good
this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about emma mr knightley  perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you knowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle  mr
weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject
we were speaking of it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with
mr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case
you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life
i can imagine your objection to harriet smith
she is not the superior young woman which emmas friend ought to be
but on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed it will be an inducement to her to read more herself
they will read together
she means it i know  emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old
i have seen a great many lists of her drawingup at various times of books that she meant to read regularly throughand very good lists they werevery well chosen and very neatly arrangedsometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule
the list she drew up when only fourteeni remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now
but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma
she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding
where miss taylor failed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothingyou never could persuade her to read half so much as you wishedyou know you could not  i dare say replied mrs weston smiling that i thought so thenbut since we have parted i can never remember emmas omitting to do any thing i wished  there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as thatsaid mr knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done
but i he soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses must still see hear and remember
emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family
at ten years old she had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen
she was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident
and ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house and of you all
in her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her
she inherits her mothers talents and must have been under subjection to her  i should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on your recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouses family and wanted another situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body
i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held  yes said he smiling
you are better placed here very fit for a wife but not at all for a governess
but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield
you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor  thank you
there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr weston  why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne
we will not despair however
weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him  i hope not thatit is not likely
no mr knightley do not foretell vexation from that quarter  not i indeed
i only name possibilities
i do not pretend to emmas genius for foretelling and guessing
i hope with all my heart the young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortunebut harriet smithi have not half done about harriet smith
i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have
she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing
she is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse because undesigned
her ignorance is hourly flattery
how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority
and as for harriet i will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance
hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to
she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home
i am much mistaken if emmas doctrines give any strength of mind or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in lifethey only give a little polish  i either depend more upon emmas good sense than you do or am more anxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance
how well she looked last night  oh
you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you
very well i shall not attempt to deny emmas being pretty  pretty
say beautiful rather
can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogetherface and figure  i do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers
but i am a partial old friend  such an eyethe true hazle eyeand so brilliant
regular features open countenance with a complexion
oh
what a bloom of full health and such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure
there is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head her glance
one hears sometimes of a child being the picture of health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grownup health
she is loveliness itself
mr knightley is not she  i have not a fault to find with her person he replied
i think her all you describe
i love to look at her and i will add this praise that i do not think her personally vain
considering how very handsome she is she appears to be little occupied with it her vanity lies another way
mrs weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm  and i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm
with all dear emmas little faults she is an excellent creature
where shall we see a better daughter or a kinder sister or a truer friend
no no she has qualities which may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong she will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the right a hundred times  very well i will not plague you any more
emma shall be an angel and i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john and isabella
john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children
i am sure of having their opinions with me  i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emmas mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smiths intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you
pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself
it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr knightley at this little remains of office  not at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it
it is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found for it shall be attended to  mrs
john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy about her sister  be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry
i will keep my illhumour to myself
i have a very sincere interest in emma
isabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a greater interest perhaps hardly so great
there is an anxiety a curiosity in what one feels for emma
i wonder what will become of her  so do i said mrs weston gently very much  she always declares she will never marry which of course means just nothing at all
but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for
it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object
i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good
but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom from home  there does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present said mrs weston as can well be and while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor mr woodhouses account
i do not recommend matrimony at present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you  part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr westons on the subject as much as possible
there were wishes at randalls respecting emmas destiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield
emma could not feel a doubt of having given harriets fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of mr eltons being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on harriets side as there could be any occasion for
she was quite convinced of mr eltons being in the fairest way of falling in love if not in love already
she had no scruple with regard to him
he talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add
his perception of the striking improvement of harriets manner since her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment
you have given miss smith all that she required said he you have made her graceful and easy
she was a beautiful creature when she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature  i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints
she had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself
i have done very little  if it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant mr elton  i have perhaps given her a little more decision of character have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before  exactly so that is what principally strikes me
so much superadded decision of character
skilful has been the hand  great has been the pleasure i am sure
i never met with a disposition more truly amiable  i have no doubt of it and it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover
she was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriets picture
did you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did you ever sit for your picture  harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say with a very interesting navet  oh
dear no never  no sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed  what an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be
i would give any money for it
i almost long to attempt her likeness myself
you do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had a great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of my friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general
but from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust
but really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me
it would be such a delight to have her picture  let me entreat you cried mr elton it would indeed be a delight
let me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend
i know what your drawings are
how could you suppose me ignorant
is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figurepieces in her drawingroom at randalls  yes good manthought emmabut what has all that to do with taking likenesses
you know nothing of drawing
dont pretend to be in raptures about mine
keep your raptures for harriets face
well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe i shall try what i can do
harriets features are very delicate which makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch  exactly sothe shape of the eye and the lines about the mouthi have not a doubt of your success
pray pray attempt it
as you will do it it will indeed to use your own words be an exquisite possession  but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit
she thinks so little of her own beauty
did not you observe her manner of answering me
how completely it meant why should my picture be drawn  oh
yes i observed it i assure you
it was not lost on me
but still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded  harriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others
emma wished to go to work directly and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they might decide together on the best size for harriet
her many beginnings were displayed
miniatures halflengths wholelengths pencil crayon and watercolours had been all tried in turn
she had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to
she played and sangand drew in almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of
she was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved
there was merit in every drawingin the least finished perhaps the most her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same
they were both in ecstasies
a likeness pleases every body and miss woodhouses performances must be capital
no great variety of faces for you said emma
i had only my own family to study from
there is my fatheranother of my fatherbut the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore
mrs weston again and again and again you see
dear mrs weston
always my kindest friend on every occasion
she would sit whenever i asked her
there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figureand the face not unlike
i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet
then here come all my attempts at three of those four childrenthere they are henry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other and any one of them might do for any one of the rest
she was so eager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the air and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any of mamas children ever were
here is my sketch of the fourth who was a baby
i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see
he had nestled down his head most conveniently
thats very like
i am rather proud of little george
the corner of the sofa is very good
then here is my lastunclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size wholelengthmy last and my bestmy brother mr john knightleythis did not want much of being finished when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness
i could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i had really made a very good likeness of itmrs weston and i were quite agreed in thinking it very likeonly too handsometoo flatteringbut that was a fault on the right sideafter all this came poor dear isabellas cold approbation ofyes it was a little likebut to be sure it did not do him justice
we had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all
it was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i could bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in brunswick squareand as i said i did then forswear ever drawing any body again
but for harriets sake or rather for my own and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present i will break my resolution now  mr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe
exactly so
no husbands and wives with so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once
but as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer
she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait
it was to be a wholelength in watercolours like mr john knightleys and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece
the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist
but there was no doing any thing with mr elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch
she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence but was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to place himself elsewhere
it then occurred to her to employ him in reading
if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness indeed
it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen the irksomeness of miss smiths  mr elton was only too happy
harriet listened and emma drew in peace
she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmedthere was no being displeased with such an encourager for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible
she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable
the sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first days sketch to wish to go on
there was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling its destined place with credit to them botha standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations as mr eltons very promising attachment was likely to add
harriet was to sit again the next day and mr elton just as he ought entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again
by all means
we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party  the same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction took place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress of the picture which was rapid and happy
every body who saw it was pleased but mr elton was in continual raptures and defended it through every criticism
miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wantedobserved mrs weston to himnot in the least suspecting that she was addressing a loverthe expression of the eye is most correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes
it is the fault of her face that she has them not  do you think so replied he
i cannot agree with you
it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature
i never saw such a likeness in my life
we must allow for the effect of shade you know  you have made her too tall emma said mr knightley
emma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmly added  oh no
certainly not too tall not in the least too tall
consider she is sitting downwhich naturally presents a differentwhich in short gives exactly the ideaand the proportions must be preserved you know
proportions foreshorteningoh no
it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smiths
exactly so indeed  it is very pretty said mr woodhouse
so prettily done
just as your drawings always are my dear
i do not know any body who draws so well as you do
the only thing i do not thoroughly like is that she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl over her shouldersand it makes one think she must catch cold  but my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer
look at the tree  but it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear  you sir may say any thing cried mr elton but i must confess that i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss smith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit
any other situation would have been much less in character
the navet of miss smiths mannersand altogetheroh it is most admirable
i cannot keep my eyes from it
i never saw such a likeness  the next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a few difficulties
it must be done directly it must be done in london the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions must not be applied to because it was december and mr woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of december
but no sooner was the distress known to mr elton than it was removed
his gallantry was always on the alert
might he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it
he could ride to london at any time
it was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand  he was too goodshe could not endure the thoughtshe would not give him such a troublesome office for the worldbrought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurancesand a very few minutes settled the business
mr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough
what a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he received it
this man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma
i should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love
he is an excellent young man and will suit harriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal
i come in for a pretty good share as a second
but it is his gratitude on harriets account       the very day of mr eltons going to london produced a fresh occasion for emmas services towards her friend
harriet had been at hartfield as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell
half a minute brought it all out
she had heard as soon as she got back to mrs goddards that mr martin had been there an hour before and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself and this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct proposal of marriage
who could have thought it
she was so surprized she did not know what to do
yes quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so
and he wrote as if he really loved her very muchbut she did not knowand so she was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she should do emma was halfashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful
upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking
he will connect himself well if he can  will you read the letter cried harriet
pray do
iid rather you would  emma was not sorry to be pressed
she read and was surprized
the style of the letter was much above her expectation
there were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer
it was short but expressed good sense warm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling
she paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add is it a good letter
or is it too short  yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowlyso good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him
i can hardly imagine the young man whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the style of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise not diffuse enough for a woman
no doubt he is a sensible man and i suppose may have a natural talent forthinks strongly and clearlyand when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find proper words
it is so with some men
yes i understand the sort of mind
vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse
a better written letter harriet returning it than i had expected  well said the still waiting harrietwellandand what shall i do  what shall you do
in what respect
do you mean with regard to this letter  yes  but what are you in doubt of
you must answer it of courseand speedily  yes
but what shall i say
dear miss woodhouse do advise me  oh no no
the letter had much better be all your own
you will express yourself very properly i am sure
there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing
your meaning must be unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires will present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded
you need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment  you think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down
ought to refuse him
my dear harriet what do you mean
are you in any doubt as to that
i thoughtbut i beg your pardon perhaps i have been under a mistake
i certainly have been misunderstanding you if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer
i had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it  harriet was silent
with a little reserve of manner emma continued  you mean to return a favourable answer i collect  no i do not that is i do not meanwhat shall i do
what would you advise me to do
pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do  i shall not give you any advice harriet
i will have nothing to do with it
this is a point which you must settle with your feelings  i had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet contemplating the letter
for a little while emma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say  i lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him
if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say no directly
it is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings with half a heart
i thought it my duty as a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you
but do not imagine that i want to influence you  oh
no i am sure you are a great deal too kind tobut if you would just advise me what i had best dono no i do not mean thatas you say ones mind ought to be quite made upone should not be hesitatingit is a very serious thingit will be safer to say no perhapsdo you think i had better say no  not for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise you either way
you must be the best judge of your own happiness
if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate
you blush harrietdoes any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition
harriet harriet do not deceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion
at this moment whom are you thinking of  the symptoms were favourableinstead of answering harriet turned away confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though the letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted about without regard
emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes
at last with some hesitation harriet said  miss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must do as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mindto refuse mr martin
do you think i am right  perfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just what you ought
while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving
dear harriet i give myself joy of this
it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr martin
while you were in the smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would not influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me
i could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbeymill farm
now i am secure of you for ever  harriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck her forcibly
you could not have visited me she cried looking aghast
no to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before
that would have been too dreadfulwhat an escapedear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world  indeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you but it must have been
you would have thrown yourself out of all good society
i must have given you up  dear mehow should i ever have borne it
it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more  dear affectionate creatureyou banished to abbeymill farmyou confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life
i wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it
he must have a pretty good opinion of himself  i do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet her conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured and i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard forbut that is quite a different thing fromand you know though he may like me it does not follow that i shouldand certainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen peopleand if one comes to compare them person and manners there is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable
however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to meand his writing such a letterbut as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration  thank you thank you my own sweet little friend
we will not be parted
a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter  oh noand it is but a short letter too  emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could write a good letter  oh
yes very
nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always happy with pleasant companions
i am quite determined to refuse him
but how shall i do
what shall i say  emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence
the looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful that emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all
this letter however was written and sealed and sent
the business was finished and harriet safe
she was rather low all the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr elton
i shall never be invited to abbeymill again was said in rather a sorrowful tone
nor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet
you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbeymill  and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield  some time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened
i am sure miss nash wouldfor miss nash thinks her own sister very well married and it is only a linendraper  one should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school harriet
i dare say miss nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married
even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes
as to any thing superior for you i suppose she is quite in the dark
the attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittletattle of highbury yet
hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves  harriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering that people should like her so much
the idea of mr elton was certainly cheering but still after a time she was tenderhearted again towards the rejected mr martin
now he has got my letter said she softly
i wonder what they are all doingwhether his sisters knowif he is unhappy they will be unhappy too
i hope he will not mind it so very much  let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed cried emma
at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name  my picturebut he has left my picture in bondstreet  has he sothen i know nothing of mr elton
no my dear little modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be in bondstreet till just before he mounts his horse tomorrow
it is his companion all this evening his solace his delight
it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession
how cheerful how animated how suspicious how busy their imaginations all are  harriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger
harriet slept at hartfield that night
for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a bedroom appropriated to herself and emma judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible just at present
she was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs goddards but it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield to make a regular visit of some days
while she was gone mr knightley called and sat some time with mr woodhouse and emma till mr woodhouse who had previously made up his mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it and was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples of his own civility to leave mr knightley for that purpose
mr knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering by his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other
well i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take emmas advice and go out for a quarter of an hour
as the sun is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can
i treat you without ceremony mr knightley
we invalids think we are privileged people  my dear sir do not make a stranger of me  i leave an excellent substitute in my daughter
emma will be happy to entertain you
and therefore i think i will beg your excuse and take my three turnsmy winter walk  you cannot do better sir  i would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley but i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey  thank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i think the sooner you go the better
i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you  mr woodhouse at last was off but mr knightley instead of being immediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined for more chat
he began speaking of harriet and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before
i cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a pretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of her disposition
her character depends upon those she is with but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman  i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting  come said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will tell you that you have improved her
you have cured her of her schoolgirls giggle she really does you credit  thank you
i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may
you do not often overpower me with it  you are expecting her again you say this morning  almost every moment
she has been gone longer already than she intended  something has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps  highbury gossipstiresome wretches  harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would  emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing
he presently added with a smile  i do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you that i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage  indeed
how so
of what sort  a very serious sort i assure you still smiling
very serious
i can think of but one thingwho is in love with her
who makes you their confidant  emma was more than half in hopes of mr eltons having dropt a hint
mr knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew mr elton looked up to him
i have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable quarterrobert martin is the man
her visit to abbeymill this summer seems to have done his business
he is desperately in love and means to marry her  he is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet means to marry him  well well means to make her an offer then
will that do
he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it
he knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and i believe considers me as one of his best friends
he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early whether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his choice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered especially since your making so much of her as in a line of society above him
i was very much pleased with all that he said
i never hear better sense from any one than robert martin
he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging
he told me every thing his circumstances and plans and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage
he is an excellent young man both as son and brother
i had no hesitation in advising him to marry
he proved to me that he could afford it and that being the case i was convinced he could not do better
i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy
if he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought highly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had
this happened the night before last
now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should be at mrs goddards today and she may be detained by a visitor without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch  pray mr knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech how do you know that mr martin did not speak yesterday  certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred
was not she the whole day with you  come said she i will tell you something in return for what you have told me
he did speak yesterdaythat is he wrote and was refused  this was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed and mr knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure as he stood up in tall indignation and said  then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her
what is the foolish girl about  oh
to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage
a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her  nonsense
a man does not imagine any such thing
but what is the meaning of this
harriet smith refuse robert martin
madness if it is so but i hope you are mistaken  i saw her answernothing could be clearer  you saw her answeryou wrote her answer too
emma this is your doing
you persuaded her to refuse him  and if i did which however i am far from allowing i should not feel that i had done wrong
mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriets equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her
by your account he does seem to have had some scruples
it is a pity that they were ever got over  not harriets equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly and warmly and with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he is not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation
emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you
what are harriet smiths claims either of birth nature or education to any connexion higher than robert martin
she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision at all and certainly no respectable relations
she is known only as parlourboarder at a common school
she is not a sensible girl nor a girl of any information
she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself
at her age she can have no experience and with her little wit is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her
she is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all
my only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being beneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him
i felt that as to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse
but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well
the advantage of the match i felt to be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cryout upon her extreme good luck
even your satisfaction i made sure of
it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friends leaving highbury for the sake of her being settled so well
i remember saying to myself even emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a good match  i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing
what
think a farmer and with all his sense and all his merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate friend
not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own
i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings
i assure you mine are very different
i must think your statement by no means fair
you are not just to harriets claims
they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in societythe sphere in which she moves is much above hisit would be a degradation  a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a respectable intelligent gentlemanfarmer  as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense
she is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought upthere can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentlemanand a gentleman of fortuneher allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfortthat she is a gentlemans daughter is indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemens daughters no one i apprehend will denyshe is superior to mr robert martin  whoever might be her parents said mr knightley whoever may have had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society
after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs goddards hands to shift as she canto move in short in mrs goddards line to have mrs goddards acquaintance
her friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was good enough
she desired nothing better herself
till you chose to turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set nor any ambition beyond it
she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer
she had no sense of superiority then
if she has it now you have given it
you have been no friend to harriet smith emma
robert martin would never have proceeded so far if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him
i know him well
he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion
and as to conceit he is the farthest from it of any man i know
depend upon it he had encouragement  it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again
you are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before are unjust to harriet
harriets claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them
she is not a clever girl but she has better sense than you are aware of and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly
waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and goodnatured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninetynine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with wellinformed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice
her goodnature too is not so very slight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness of temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great readiness to be pleased with other people
i am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper the highest claims a woman could possess  upon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have is almost enough to make me think so too
better be without sense than misapply it as you do  to be sure cried she playfully
i know that is the feeling of you all
i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights inwhat at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment
oh
harriet may pick and chuse
were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you
and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives
nopray let her have time to look about her  i have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr knightley presently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet
you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her
vanity working on a weak head produces every sort of mischief
nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high
miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl
men of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives
men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurityand most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed
let her marry robert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune she may be a parlourboarder at mrs goddards all the rest of her lifeor at least for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate and is glad to catch at the old writingmasters son  we think so very differently on this point mr knightley that there can be no use in canvassing it
we shall only be making each other more angry
but as to my letting her marry robert martin it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application
she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do
his appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad that if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now
i can imagine that before she had seen any body superior she might tolerate him
he was the brother of her friends and he took pains to please her and altogether having seen nobody better that must have been his great assistant she might not while she was at abbeymill find him disagreeable
but the case is altered now
she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet  nonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr knightleyrobert martins manners have sense sincerity and goodhumour to recommend them and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand  emma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone
she did not repent what she had done she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable
some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence with only one attempt on emmas side to talk of the weather but he made no answer
he was thinking
the result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words
robert martin has no great lossif he can but think so and i hope it will not be long before he does
your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of matchmaking it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you haveand as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain  emma laughed and disclaimed
he continued  depend upon it elton will not do
elton is a very good sort of man and a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely to make an imprudent match
he knows the value of a good income as well as any body
elton may talk sentimentally but he will act rationally
he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you can be with harriets
he knows that he is a very handsome young man and a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present i am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away
i have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece  i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again
if i had set my heart on mr eltons marrying harriet it would have been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want to keep harriet to myself
i have done with matchmaking indeed
i could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls
i shall leave off while i am well  good morning to yousaid he rising and walking off abruptly
he was very much vexed
he felt the disappointment of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly
emma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more indistinctness in the causes of hers than in his
she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversarys wrong as mr knightley
he walked off in more complete selfapprobation than he left for her
she was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives
harriets staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy
the possibility of the young mans coming to mrs goddards that morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause gave alarming ideas
the dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits and without having any such reason to give for her long absence she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind and convinced her that let mr knightley think or say what he would she had done nothing which womans friendship and womans feelings would not justify
he had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered that mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of mr knightleys pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about
he certainly might have heard mr elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done and mr elton might not be of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them but then mr knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives
mr knightley saw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest and more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very sure did not belong to mr elton
harriets cheerful look and manner established hers she came back not to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton
miss nash had been telling her something which she repeated immediately with great delight
mr perry had been to mrs goddards to attend a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met mr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whistclub night which he had been never known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been determined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious
mr perry could not quite understand him but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case and he told him so and mr elton only looked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits
miss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more about mr elton and said looking so very significantly at her that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be but she only knew that any woman whom mr elton could prefer she should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt mr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness       mr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel with herself
he was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven
she was sorry but could not repent
on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days
the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after mr eltons return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sittingroom he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought and as for harriets feelings they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted
emma was soon perfectly satisfied of mr martins being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantage to the latter
her views of improving her little friends mind by a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on tomorrow
it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriets fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hotpressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies
in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon
miss nash headteacher at mrs goddards had written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken the first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouses help to get a great many more
emma assisted with her invention memory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form as well as quantity
mr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in
so many clever riddles as there used to be when he was younghe wondered he could not remember them
but he hoped he should in time and it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid  his good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind but he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about so much something he thought might come from that quarter
it was by no means his daughters wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition
mr elton was the only one whose assistance she asked
he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums that he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections and at the same time as she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips
they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled and rather sentimentally recited that wellknown charade  my first doth affliction denote     which my second is destind to feel and my whole is the best antidote     that affliction to soften and heal   made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already
why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton said she that is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be easier to you  oh no
he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life
the stupidest fellow
he was afraid not even miss woodhousehe stopt a momentor miss smith could inspire him  the very next day however produced some proof of inspiration
he called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own
i do not offer it for miss smiths collection said he
being my friends i have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it  the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could understand
there was deep consciousness about him and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friends
he was gone the next momentafter another moments pause  take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards harrietit is for you
take your own  but harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and emma never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself
to miss   charade
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings     lords of the earth
their luxury and ease
another view of man my second brings     behold him there the monarch of the seas
but ah
united what reverse we have
mans boasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave     and woman lovely woman reigns alone
thy ready wit the word will soon supply     may its approval beam in that soft eye
she cast her eye over it pondered caught the meaning read it through again to be quite certain and quite mistress of the lines and then passing it to harriet sat happily smiling and saying to herself while harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness very well mr elton very well indeed
i have read worse charades
courtshipa very good hint
i give you credit for it
this is feeling your way
this is saying very plainlypray miss smith give me leave to pay my addresses to you
approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance  may its approval beam in that soft eye
harriet exactly
soft is the very word for her eyeof all epithets the justest that could be given
thy ready wit the word will soon supply
humphharriets ready wit
all the better
a man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so
ah
mr knightley i wish you had the benefit of this i think this would convince you
for once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken
an excellent charade indeed
and very much to the purpose
things must come to a crisis soon now  she was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the eagerness of harriets wondering questions
what can it be miss woodhousewhat can it be
i have not an ideai cannot guess it in the least
what can it possibly be
do try to find it out miss woodhouse
do help me
i never saw any thing so hard
is it kingdom
i wonder who the friend wasand who could be the young lady
do you think it is a good one
can it be woman
and woman lovely woman reigns alone
can it be neptune
behold him there the monarch of the seas
or a trident
or a mermaid
or a shark
oh no
shark is only one syllable
it must be very clever or he would not have brought it
oh
miss woodhouse do you think we shall ever find it out  mermaids and sharks
nonsense
my dear harriet what are you thinking of
where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark
give me the paper and listen
for miss  read miss smith
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings     lords of the earth
their luxury and ease
that is court
another view of man my second brings     behold him there the monarch of the seas
that is shipplain as it can benow for the cream
but ah
united courtship you know what reverse we have
mans boasted power and freedom all are flown
lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave     and woman lovely woman reigns alone
a very proper complimentand then follows the application which i think my dear harriet you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending
read it in comfort to yourself
there can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you  harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion
she read the concluding lines and was all flutter and happiness
she could not speak
but she was not wanted to speak
it was enough for her to feel
emma spoke for her
there is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment said she that i cannot have a doubt as to mr eltons intentions
you are his objectand you will soon receive the completest proof of it
i thought it must be so
i thought i could not be so deceived but now it is clear the state of his mind is as clear and decided as my wishes on the subject have been ever since i knew you
yes harriet just so long have i been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened
i could never tell whether an attachment between you and mr elton were most desirable or most natural
its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other
i am very happy
i congratulate you my dear harriet with all my heart
this is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating
this is a connexion which offers nothing but good
it will give you every thing that you wantconsideration independence a proper homeit will fix you in the centre of all your real friends close to hartfield and to me and confirm our intimacy for ever
this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us  dear miss woodhouseand dear miss woodhouse was all that harriet with many tender embraces could articulate at first but when they did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw felt anticipated and remembered just as she ought
mr eltons superiority had very ample acknowledgment
whatever you say is always right cried harriet and therefore i suppose and believe and hope it must be so but otherwise i could not have imagined it
it is so much beyond any thing i deserve
mr elton who might marry any body
there cannot be two opinions about him
he is so very superior
only think of those sweet versesto miss  dear me how clevercould it really be meant for me  i cannot make a question or listen to a question about that
it is a certainty
receive it on my judgment
it is a sort of prologue to the play a motto to the chapter and will be soon followed by matteroffact prose  it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected
i am sure a month ago i had no more idea myselfthe strangest things do take place  when miss smiths and mr eltons get acquaintedthey do indeedand really it is strange it is out of the common course that what is so evidently so palpably desirablewhat courts the prearrangement of other people should so immediately shape itself into the proper form
you and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes
your marrying will be equal to the match at randalls
there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow
the course of true love never did run smooth   a hartfield edition of shakespeare would have a long note on that passage  that mr elton should really be in love with meme of all people who did not know him to speak to him at michaelmas
and he the very handsomest man that ever was and a man that every body looks up to quite like mr knightley
his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week
and so excellent in the church
miss nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to highbury
dear me
when i look back to the first time i saw him
how little did i thinkthe two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very goodnatured
and how beautiful we thought he looked
he was arminarm with mr cole  this is an alliance which whoeverwhatever your friends may be must be agreeable to them provided at least they have common sense and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools
if they are anxious to see you happily married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of itif they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be well married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them  yes very true
how nicely you talk i love to hear you
you understand every thing
you and mr elton are one as clever as the other
this charadeif i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it  i thought he meant to try his skill by his manner of declining it yesterday  i do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read  i never read one more to the purpose certainly  it is as long again as almost all we have had before  i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour
such things in general cannot be too short  harriet was too intent on the lines to hear
the most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind
it is one thing said she presentlyher cheeks in a glowto have very good sense in a common way like every body else and if there is any thing to say to sit down and write a letter and say just what you must in a short way and another to write verses and charades like this  emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr martins prose
such sweet lines continued harrietthese two lastbut how shall i ever be able to return the paper or say i have found it outoh
miss woodhouse what can we do about that  leave it to me
you do nothing
he will be here this evening i dare say and then i will give it him back and some nonsense or other will pass between us and you shall not be committedyour soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming
trust to me  oh
miss woodhouse what a pity that i must not write this beautiful charade into my book
i am sure i have not got one half so good  leave out the two last lines and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book  oh
but those two lines are  the best of all
grantedfor private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them
they are not at all the less written you know because you divide them
the couplet does not cease to be nor does its meaning change
but take it away and all appropriation ceases and a very pretty gallant charade remains fit for any collection
depend upon it he would not like to have his charade slighted much better than his passion
a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither
give me the book i will write it down and then there can be no possible reflection on you  harriet submitted though her mind could hardly separate the parts so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love
it seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity
i shall never let that book go out of my own hands said she
very well replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased
but here is my father coming you will not object to my reading the charade to him
it will be giving him so much pleasure
he loves any thing of the sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment
he has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us allyou must let me read it to him  harriet looked grave
my dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this charadeyou will betray your feelings improperly if you are too conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it
do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration
if he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper while i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you
do not let us be too solemn on the business
he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade  oh
noi hope i shall not be ridiculous about it
do as you please  mr woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears how does your book go onhave you got any thing fresh  yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh
a piece of paper was found on the table this morningdropt we suppose by a fairycontaining a very pretty charade and we have just copied it in  she read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read slowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations of every part as she proceededand he was very much pleased and as she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion
aye thats very just indeed thats very properly said
very true
woman lovely woman it is such a pretty charade my dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought itnobody could have written so prettily but you emma  emma only nodded and smiledafter a little thinking and a very tender sigh he added  ah
it is no difficulty to see who you take after
your dear mother was so clever at all those things
if i had but her memory
but i can remember nothingnot even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza and there are several
kitty a fair but frozen maid     kindled a flame i yet deplore the hoodwinkd boy i called to aid though of his near approach afraid     so fatal to my suit before
and that is all that i can recollect of itbut it is very clever all the way through
but i think my dear you said you had got it  yes papa it is written out in our second page
we copied it from the elegant extracts
it was garricks you know  aye very truei wish i could recollect more of it
kitty a fair but frozen maid
the name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near being christened catherine after her grandmama
i hope we shall have her here next week
have you thought my dear where you shall put herand what room there will be for the children  oh
yesshe will have her own room of course the room she always hasand there is the nursery for the childrenjust as usual you know
why should there be any change  i do not know my dearbut it is so long since she was herenot since last easter and then only for a few daysmr
john knightleys being a lawyer is very inconvenientpoor isabellashe is sadly taken away from us alland how sorry she will be when she comes not to see miss taylor here  she will not be surprized papa at least  i do not know my dear
i am sure i was very much surprized when i first heard she was going to be married  we must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella is here  yes my dear if there is timebutin a very depressed toneshe is coming for only one week
there will not be time for any thing  it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longerbut it seems a case of necessity
mr john knightley must be in town again on the th and we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country that two or three days are not to be taken out for the abbey
mr knightley promises to give up his claim this christmasthough you know it is longer since they were with him than with us  it would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were to be anywhere but at hartfield  mr woodhouse could never allow for mr knightleys claims on his brother or any bodys claims on isabella except his own
he sat musing a little while and then said  but i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back so soon though he does
i think emma i shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us
she and the children might stay very well  ah
papathat is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will
isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband  this was too true for contradiction
unwelcome as it was mr woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughters attachment to her husband she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them
harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here
i am sure she will be pleased with the children
we are very proud of the children are not we papa
i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john  aye i wonder which she will
poor little dears how glad they will be to come
they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet  i dare say they are sir
i am sure i do not know who is not  henry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama
henry is the eldest he was named after me not after his father
john the second is named after his father
some people are surprized i believe that the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry which i thought very pretty of her
and he is a very clever boy indeed
they are all remarkably clever and they have so many pretty ways
they will come and stand by my chair and say grandpapa can you give me a bit of string and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas
i think their father is too rough with them very often  he appears rough to you said emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough
he wishes his boys to be active and hardy and if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then but he is an affectionate fathercertainly mr john knightley is an affectionate father
the children are all fond of him  and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way  but they like it papa there is nothing they like so much
it is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way to the other  well i cannot understand it  that is the case with us all papa
one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other  later in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four oclock dinner the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again
harriet turned away but emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a pushof having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up
his ostensible reason however was to ask whether mr woodhouses party could be made up in the evening without him or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield
if he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend cole had been saying so much about his dining with himhad made such a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come
emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber
he reurgedshe redeclined and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it  oh
here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us thank you for the sight of it
we admired it so much that i have ventured to write it into miss smiths collection
your friend will not take it amiss i hope
of course i have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines  mr elton certainly did not very well know what to say
he looked rather doubtinglyrather confused said something about honourglanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively
with the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said  you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two
he may be sure of every womans approbation while he writes with such gallantry  i have no hesitation in saying replied mr elton though hesitating a good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in sayingat least if my friend feels at all as i doi have not the smallest doubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it looking at the book again and replacing it on the table he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life  after this speech he was gone as soon as possible
emma could not think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh
she ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriets share
though now the middle of december there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise and on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family who lived a little way out of highbury
their road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane leading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street of the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode of mr elton
a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed and then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage an old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it could be
it had no advantage of situation but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyesemmas remark was  there it is
there go you and your riddlebook one of these daysharriets was  oh what a sweet househow very beautifulthere are the yellow curtains that miss nash admires so much  i do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded but then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury  harriet she found had never in her life been inside the vicarage and her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors and probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love with mr eltons seeing ready wit in her
i wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going inno servant that i want to inquire about of his housekeeperno message from my father  she pondered but could think of nothing
after a mutual silence of some minutes harriet thus began again  i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married
so charming as you are  emma laughed and replied  my being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry i must find other people charmingone other person at least
and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all  ahso you say but i cannot believe it  i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself is out of the question and i do not wish to see any such person
i would rather not be tempted
i cannot really change for the better
if i were to marry i must expect to repent it  dear meit is so odd to hear a woman talk so  i have none of the usual inducements of women to marry
were i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing
but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall
and without love i am sure i should be a fool to change such a situation as mine
fortune i do not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husbands house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any mans eyes as i am in my fathers  but then to be an old maid at last like miss bates  that is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i thought i should ever be like miss bates
so sillyso satisfiedso smilingso prosingso undistinguishing and unfastidiousand so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry tomorrow
but between us i am convinced there never can be any likeness except in being unmarried  but still you will be an old maid
and thats so dreadful  never mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public
a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid
the proper sport of boys and girls but a single woman of good fortune is always respectable and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else
and the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper
those who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small and generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross
this does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very much to the taste of every body though single and though poor
poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm  dear me
but what shall you do
how shall you employ yourself when you grow old  if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than oneandtwenty
womans usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation
if i draw less i shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpetwork
and as for objects of interest objects for the affections which is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall be very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much to care about
there will be enough of them in all probability to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need
there will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder
my nephews and niecesi shall often have a niece with me  do you know miss batess niece
that is i know you must have seen her a hundred timesbut are you acquainted  oh
yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to highbury
by the bye that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece
heaven forbid
at least that i should ever bore people half so much about all the knightleys together as she does about jane fairfax
one is sick of the very name of jane fairfax
every letter from her is read forty times over her compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month
i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death  they were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics were superseded
emma was very compassionate and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse
she understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and their temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into their troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as goodwill
in the present instance it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to harriet as they walked away  these are the sights harriet to do one good
how trifling they make every thing else appeari feel now as if i could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind  very true said harriet
poor creatures
one can think of nothing else  and really i do not think the impression will soon be over said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them into the lane again
i do not think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still greater within
oh
dear no said her companion
they walked on
the lane made a slight bend and when that bend was passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near as to give emma time only to say farther  ah
harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts
well smiling i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important
if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves  harriet could just answer oh
dear yes before the gentleman joined them
the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting
he had been going to call on them
his visit he would now defer but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done
mr elton then turned back to accompany them
to fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma to meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase of love on each side
i should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration
it must if i were not here
i wish i were anywhere else  anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road
but she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriets habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that in short they would both be soon after her
this would not do she immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her halfboot and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in half a minute
they did as they were desired and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot she had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken by a child from the cottage setting out according to orders with her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield
to walk by the side of this child and talk to and question her was the most natural thing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been acting just then without design and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her
she gained on them however involuntarily the childs pace was quick and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them
mr elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very pleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more when they both looked around and she was obliged to join them
mr elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail and emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterdays party at his friend coles and that she was come in herself for the stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the celery the beetroot and all the dessert
this would soon have led to something better of course was her consoling reflection any thing interests between those who love and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart
if i could but have kept longer away  they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and fall behind to arrange it once more
she then broke the lace off short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently obliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort
part of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am to contrive
i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope i am not often so illequipped
mr elton i must beg leave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on  mr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage
the room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied and looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately communicated the door between them was open and emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner
she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it but she fully intended that mr elton should close it
it was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room
for ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself
it could be protracted no longer
she was then obliged to be finished and make her appearance
the lovers were standing together at one of the windows
it had a most favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully
but it would not do he had not come to the point
he had been most agreeable most delightful he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious
cautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure  still however though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them forward to the great event
mr elton must now be left to himself
it was no longer in emmas power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures
the coming of her sisters family was so very near at hand that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay at hartfield it was not to be expectedshe did not herself expectthat any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers
they might advance rapidly if they would however they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no
she hardly wished to have more leisure for them
there are people who the more you do for them the less they will do for themselves
mr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest
till this year every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to seabathing for the children and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all by mr woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london even for poor isabellas sake and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit
he thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms were needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished and mr and mrs john knightley their five children and a competent number of nurserymaids all reaching hartfield in safety
the bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to welcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this but the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by mrs john knightley that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance all the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing which they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them
mrs john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle quiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate wrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for these higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible
she could never see a fault in any of them
she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance of her father she inherited also much of his constitution was delicate in her own health overcareful of that of her children had many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr wingfield in town as her father could be of mr perry
they were alike too in a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance
mr john knightley was a tall gentlemanlike and very clever man rising in his profession domestic and respectable in his private character but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour
he was not an illtempered man not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased
the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his
he had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted and he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing
he was not a great favourite with his fair sisterinlaw
nothing wrong in him escaped her
she was quick in feeling the little injuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself
perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabellas sister but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father
there he had not always the patience that could have been wished
mr woodhouses peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally illbestowed
it did not often happen for mr john knightley had really a great regard for his fatherinlaw and generally a strong sense of what was due to him but it was too often for emmas charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured though the offence came not
the beginning however of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality
they had not been long seated and composed when mr woodhouse with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughters attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last
ah my dear said he poor miss taylorit is a grievous business  oh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must miss her
and dear emma toowhat a dreadful loss to you bothi have been so grieved for youi could not imagine how you could possibly do without herit is a sad change indeedbut i hope she is pretty well sir  pretty well my deari hopepretty welli do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably  mr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls
oh
nonone in the least
i never saw mrs weston better in my lifenever looking so well
papa is only speaking his own regret  very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply
and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father
mr woodhouse hesitatednot near so often my dear as i could wish  oh
papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married
either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or hereand as you may suppose isabella most frequently here
they are very very kind in their visits
mr weston is really as kind as herself
papa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving isabella a false idea of us all
every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipatedwhich is the exact truth  just as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hoped it was from your letters
her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy
i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended and now you have emmas account i hope you will be satisfied  why to be sure said mr woodhouseyes certainlyi cannot deny that mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty oftenbut thenshe is always obliged to go away again  it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papayou quite forget poor mr weston  i think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr weston has some little claim
you and i emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband
i being a husband and you not being a wife the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force
as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can  me my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part are you talking about mei am sure nobody ought to be or can be a greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought of miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world and as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think there is nothing he does not deserve
i believe he is one of the very besttempered men that ever existed
excepting yourself and your brother i do not know his equal for temper
i shall never forget his flying henrys kite for him that very windy day last easterand ever since his particular kindness last september twelvemonth in writing that note at twelve oclock at night on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham i have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existenceif any body can deserve him it must be miss taylor  where is the young man said john knightley
has he been here on this occasionor has he not  he has not been here yet replied emma
there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended in nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately  but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father
he wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her and a very proper handsome letter it was
she shewed it to me
i thought it very well done of him indeed
whether it was his own idea you know one cannot tell
he is but young and his uncle perhaps  my dear papa he is threeandtwenty
you forget how time passes  threeandtwentyis he indeedwell i could not have thought itand he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother
well time does fly indeedand my memory is very bad
however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure
i remember it was written from weymouth and dated sept thand began my dear madam but i forget how it went on and it was signed f
c weston churchilli remember that perfectly  how very pleasing and proper of him cried the goodhearted mrs john knightley
i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man
but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father
there is something so shocking in a childs being taken away from his parents and natural home
i never could comprehend how mr weston could part with him
to give up ones child
i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else  nobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy observed mr john knightley coolly
but you need not imagine mr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john
mr weston is rather an easy cheerfultempered man than a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect much more upon what is called society for his comforts that is upon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords  emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr weston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass
she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the allsufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brothers disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was importantit had a high claim to forbearance
mr knightley was to dine with themrather against the inclination of mr woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him in isabellas first day
emmas sense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between mr knightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation
she hoped they might now become friends again
she thought it was time to make up
makingup indeed would not do
she certainly had not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had
concession must be out of the question but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children with herthe youngest a nice little girl about eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield and very happy to be danced about in her aunts arms
it did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity
emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby  what a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces
as to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree  if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them as you are where these children are concerned we might always think alike  to be sureour discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong  yes said he smilingand reason good
i was sixteen years old when you were born  a material difference then she repliedand no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does not the lapse of oneandtwenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer  yesa good deal nearer  but still not near enough to give me a chance of being right if we think differently  i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child
come my dear emma let us be friends and say no more about it
tell your aunt little emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now  thats true she criedvery true
little emma grow up a better woman than your aunt
be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited
now mr knightley a word or two more and i have done
as far as good intentions went we were both right and i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong
i only want to know that mr martin is not very very bitterly disappointed  a man cannot be more so was his short full answer
ahindeed i am very sorrycome shake hands with me  this had just taken place and with great cordiality when john knightley made his appearance and how dye do george and john how are you succeeded in the true english style burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment which would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing for the good of the other
the evening was quiet and conversable as mr woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions on one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr knightleys their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixingand emma only occasionally joining in one or the other
the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative and who was always the greater talker
as a magistrate he had generally some point of law to consult john about or at least some curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand the homefarm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear next year and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong
the plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree and the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn was entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his cooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness
while they were thus comfortably occupied mr woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter
my poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand and interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one of her five childrenhow long it is how terribly long since you were here
and how tired you must be after your journey
you must go to bed early my dearand i recommend a little gruel to you before you goyou and i will have a nice basin of gruel together
my dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel  emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the mr knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herselfand two basins only were ordered
after a little more discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say with an air of grave reflection  it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here
i never had much opinion of the sea air  mr
wingfield most strenuously recommended it siror we should not have gone
he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bellas throatboth sea air and bathing  ah
my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body
i am sure it almost killed me once  come come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject i must beg you not to talk of the sea
it makes me envious and miserablei who have never seen it
south end is prohibited if you please
my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you  oh
good mr perryhow is he sir  why pretty well but not quite well
poor perry is bilious and he has not time to take care of himselfhe tells me he has not time to take care of himselfwhich is very sadbut he is always wanted all round the country
i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere
but then there is not so clever a man any where  and mrs perry and the children how are they
do the children grow
i have a great regard for mr perry
i hope he will be calling soon
he will be so pleased to see my little ones  i hope he will be here tomorrow for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence
and my dear whenever he comes you had better let him look at little bellas throat  oh
my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it
either bathing has been of the greatest service to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of mr wingfields which we have been applying at times ever since august  it is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to herand if i had known you were wanting an embrocation i would have spoken to  you seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates said emma i have not heard one inquiry after them  oh
the good batesesi am quite ashamed of myselfbut you mention them in most of your letters
i hope they are quite well
good old mrs batesi will call upon her tomorrow and take my childrenthey are always so pleased to see my childrenand that excellent miss batessuch thorough worthy peoplehow are they sir  why pretty well my dear upon the whole
but poor mrs bates had a bad cold about a month ago  how sorry i am
but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn
mr wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavyexcept when it has been quite an influenza  that has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree you mention
perry says that colds have been very general but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november
perry does not call it altogether a sickly season  no i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except  ah
my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always a sickly season
nobody is healthy in london nobody can be
it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there
so far offand the air so bad  no indeedwe are not at all in a bad air
our part of london is very superior to most othersyou must not confound us with london in general my dear sir
the neighbourhood of brunswick square is very different from almost all the rest
we are so very airy
i should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the townthere is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my children in but we are so remarkably airymr
wingfield thinks the vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as to air  ah
my dear it is not like hartfield
you make the best of itbut after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same
now i cannot say that i think you are any of you looking well at present  i am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those little nervous headaches and palpitations which i am never entirely free from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were a little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness of coming
i hope you will think better of their looks tomorrow for i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether in such good case
i trust at least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband
middling my dear i cannot compliment you
i think mr john knightley very far from looking well  what is the matter sirdid you speak to me cried mr john knightley hearing his own name
i am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you looking wellbut i hope it is only from being a little fatigued
i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home  my dear isabellaexclaimed he hastilypray do not concern yourself about my looks
be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children and let me look as i chuse  i did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother cried emma about your friend mr grahams intending to have a bailiff from scotland to look after his new estate
what will it answer
will not the old prejudice be too strong  and she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing worse to hear than isabellas kind inquiry after jane fairfax and jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising
that sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs john knightleyit is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment accidentally in town
what happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them
i always regret excessively on dear emmas account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all
she would be such a delightful companion for emma  mr woodhouse agreed to it all but added  our little friend harriet smith however is just such another pretty kind of young person
you will like harriet
emma could not have a better companion than harriet  i am most happy to hear itbut only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superiorand exactly emmas age  this topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of similar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation
the gruel came and supplied a great deal to be saidmuch praise and many commentsundoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution and pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerablybut unfortunately among the failures which the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore most prominent was in her own cook at south end a young woman hired for the time who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin
often as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able to get any thing tolerable
here was a dangerous opening
ah said mr woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concernthe ejaculation in emmas ear expressed ah
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to south end
it does not bear talking of and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel
after an interval of some minutes however he began with  i shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn instead of coming here  but why should you be sorry siri assure you it did the children a great deal of good  and moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not have been to south end
south end is an unhealthy place
perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end  i know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is quite a mistake sirwe all had our health perfectly well there never found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy and i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly  you should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhereperry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best of all the seabathing places
a fine open sea he says and very pure air
and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the seaa quarter of a mile offvery comfortable
you should have consulted perry  but my dear sir the difference of the journeyonly consider how great it would have beenan hundred miles perhaps instead of forty  ah
my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundredbetter not move at all better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air
this is just what perry said
it seemed to him a very illjudged measure  emmas attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her brotherinlaws breaking out
mr
perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for
why does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i doat my taking my family to one part of the coast or anotheri may be allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perryi want his directions no more than his drugs he pausedand growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness if mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself  true true cried mr knightley with most ready interpositionvery true
thats a consideration indeedbut john as to what i was telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows i cannot conceive any difficulty
i should not attempt it if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path
the only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps
i shall see you at the abbey tomorrow morning i hope and then we will look them over and you shall give me your opinion  mr woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been attributing many of his own feelings and expressionsbut the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it
there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs john knightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister
she had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass so swiftly
it was a delightful visitperfect in being much too short
in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas
mr weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls one dayeven mr woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party
how they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he could but as his son and daughters carriage and horses were actually at hartfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for harriet also
harriet mr elton and mr knightley their own especial set were the only persons invited to meet themthe hours were to be early as well as the numbers few mr woodhouses habits and inclination being consulted in every thing
the evening before this great event for it was a very great event that mr woodhouse should dine out on the th of december had been spent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house
emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls
she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat mrs goddard was full of care and affection mr perry was talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss without many tears
emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs goddards unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much mr eltons would be depressed when he knew her state and left her at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much
she had not advanced many yards from mrs goddards door when she was met by mr elton himself evidently coming towards it and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalidof whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going to inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfieldthey were overtaken by mr john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for
they joined company and proceeded together
emma was just describing the nature of her friends complainta throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her a quick low pulse c and she was sorry to find from mrs goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sorethroats and had often alarmed her with them mr elton looked all alarm on the occasion as he exclaimed  a sorethroati hope not infectious
i hope not of a putrid infectious sort
has perry seen her
indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend
let me entreat you to run no risks
why does not perry see her  emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs goddards experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwardsas if quite another subject  it is so cold so very coldand looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party i should really try not to go out todayand dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston
but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself
you appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues tomorrow will bring i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself tonight  mr elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of hers he had not really the least inclination to give up the visitbut emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening
you do quite right said shewe will make your apologies to mr and mrs weston  but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr eltons only objection and mr elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction
it was a done thing mr elton was to go and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her
well said she to herself this is most strangeafter i had got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave harriet ill behindmost strange indeedbut there is i believe in many men especially single men such an inclinationsuch a passion for dining outa dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures their employments their dignities almost their duties that any thing gives way to itand this must be the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young man undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still he cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked
what a strange thing love is
he can see ready wit in harriet but will not dine alone for her  soon afterwards mr elton quitted them and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs goddards for news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour
after a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley began with  i never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than mr elton
it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned
with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies to please every feature works  mr
eltons manners are not perfect replied emma but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal
where a man does his best with only moderate powers he will have the advantage over negligent superiority
there is such perfect goodtemper and goodwill in mr elton as one cannot but value  yes said mr john knightley presently with some slyness he seems to have a great deal of goodwill towards you  me she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to be mr eltons object  such an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now  mr
elton in love with mewhat an idea  i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly
i think your manners to him encouraging
i speak as a friend emma
you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do  i thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken
mr elton and i are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel
he said no more
mr woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it
the cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time
emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour
the preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice of his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least which mr john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent
a man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of coming to see him
he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing
it is the greatest absurdityactually snowing at this momentthe folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at homeand the folly of peoples not staying comfortably at home when they can
if we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of duty or business what a hardship we should deem itand here are we probably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward voluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature which tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings to stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he canhere are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another mans house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again tomorrow
going in dismal weather to return probably in worsefour horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home  emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all
she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence
she allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips
they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and mr elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly
emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject
mr elton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her
she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the samenot better  my report from mrs goddards said she presently was not so pleasant as i had hopednot better was my answer  his face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered
oh
noi am grieved to findi was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs goddards door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse
very much grieved and concernedi had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning  emma smiled and answeredmy visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed
mr perry has been with her as you probably heard  yesi imaginedthat isi did not  he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope tomorrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report
but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness
such a sad loss to our party today  dreadfulexactly so indeedshe will be missed every moment  this was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable but it should have lasted longer
emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment
what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for carriages
how very comfortable they make itimpossible to feel cold with such precautions
the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentlemans carriage perfectly complete
one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted
weather becomes absolutely of no consequence
it is a very cold afternoonbut in this carriage we know nothing of the matterha
snows a little i see  yes said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal of it  christmas weather observed mr elton
quite seasonable and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday and prevent this days party which it might very possibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence
this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings
at christmas every body invites their friends about them and people think little of even the worst weather
i was snowed up at a friends house once for a week
nothing could be pleasanter
i went for only one night and could not get away till that very day sennight  mr john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coolly  i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls  at another time emma might have been amused but she was too much astonished now at mr eltons spirits for other feelings
harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party
we are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing in the greatest comfort
charming people mr and mrs westonmrs
weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of societyit will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any
mr westons diningroom does not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part i would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two
i think you will agree with me turning with a soft air to emma i think i shall certainly have your approbation though mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of london may not quite enter into our feelings  i know nothing of the large parties of london siri never dine with any body  indeed
in a tone of wonder and pity i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery
well sir the time must come when you will be paid for all this when you will have little labour and great enjoyment  my first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through the sweepgate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again       some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs westons drawingroommr
elton must compose his joyous looks and mr john knightley disperse his illhumour
mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more to fit them for the placeemma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as happy as she was
to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons
mr weston was a great favourite and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood of being always interesting and always intelligible the little affairs arrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself
she could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs weston had not a lively concern and half an hours uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends was one of the first gratifications of each
this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole days visit might not afford which certainly did not belong to the present halfhour but the very sight of mrs weston her smile her touch her voice was grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as possible of mr eltons oddities or of any thing else unpleasant and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost
the misfortune of harriets cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival
mr woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own and isabellas coming and of emmas being to follow and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs weston who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma
emmas project of forgetting mr elton for a while made her rather sorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was close to her
the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat at her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion
instead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother imagined
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to meabsurd and insufferableyet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be so interested about her father and so delighted with mrs weston and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a wouldbe lover and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners
for her own sake she could not be rude and for harriets in the hope that all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil but it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst the others in the most overpowering period of mr eltons nonsense which she particularly wished to listen to
she heard enough to know that mr weston was giving some information about his son she heard the words my son and frank and my son repeated several times over and from a few other halfsyllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son but before she could quiet mr elton the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward
now it so happened that in spite of emmas resolution of never marrying there was something in the name in the idea of mr frank churchill which always interested her
she had frequently thoughtespecially since his fathers marriage with miss taylorthat if she were to marry he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition
he seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her
she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of
that mr and mrs weston did think of it she was very strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him or by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for she had a great curiosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant of being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations
with such sensations mr eltons civilities were dreadfully illtimed but she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling very crossand of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again or the substance of it from the openhearted mr westonso it provedfor when happily released from mr elton and seated by mr weston at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to her  we want only two more to be just the right number
i should like to see two more hereyour pretty little friend miss smith and my sonand then i should say we were quite complete
i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawingroom that we are expecting frank
i had a letter from him this morning and he will be with us within a fortnight  emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented to his proposition of mr frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete
he has been wanting to come to us continued mr weston ever since september every letter has been full of it but he cannot command his own time
he has those to please who must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices
but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january  what a very great pleasure it will be to you
and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself  yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another putoff
she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do but she does not know the parties so well as i do
the case you see isbut this is quite between ourselves i did not mention a syllable of it in the other room
there are secrets in all families you knowthe case is that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at enscombe in january and that franks coming depends upon their being put off
if they are not put off he cannot stir
but i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady of some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years they always are put off when it comes to the point
i have not the smallest doubt of the issue
i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am of being here myself but your good friend there nodding towards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself and has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot calculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice of doing  i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case replied emma but am disposed to side with you mr weston
if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe  yesi have some right to that knowledge though i have never been at the place in my lifeshe is an odd womanbut i never allow myself to speak ill of her on franks account for i do believe her to be very fond of him
i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body except herself but she has always been kind to him in her wayallowing for little whims and caprices and expecting every thing to be as she likes
and it is no small credit in my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection for though i would not say it to any body else she has no more heart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper  emma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs weston very soon after their moving into the drawingroom wishing her joyyet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming mrs weston agreed to it but added that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of for i cannot depend upon his coming
i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston
i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing
mr weston i dare say has been telling you exactly how the matter stands  yesit seems to depend upon nothing but the illhumour of mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world  my emma replied mrs weston smiling what is the certainty of caprice then turning to isabella who had not been attending beforeyou must know my dear mrs knightley that we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill in my opinion as his father thinks
it depends entirely upon his aunts spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper
to youto my two daughtersi may venture on the truth
mrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very oddtempered woman and his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him  oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill replied isabella and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion
to be constantly living with an illtempered person must be dreadful
it is what we happily have never known any thing of but it must be a life of misery
what a blessing that she never had any children
poor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them  emma wished she had been alone with mrs weston
she should then have heard more mrs weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her excepting those views on the young man of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge
but at present there was nothing more to be said
mr woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawingroom
to be sitting long after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure
neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable
while he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity of saying  and so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain
i am sorry for it
the introduction must be unpleasant whenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better  yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays
even if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us
i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves
there is jealousy
they are jealous even of his regard for his father
in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine  he ought to come said emma
if he could stay only a couple of days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young mans not having it in his power to do as much as that
a young woman if she fall into bad hands may be teased and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young mans being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week with his father if he likes it  one ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family before one decides upon what he can do replied mrs weston
one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules she is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her  but she is so fond of the nephew he is so very great a favourite
now according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband to whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice towards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew to whom she owes nothing at all  my dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper to understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it you must let it go its own way
i have no doubt of his having at times considerable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be  emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied unless he comes  he may have a great deal of influence on some points continued mrs weston and on others very little and among those on which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us       mr woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three companions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour before the other gentlemen appeared
mr weston was chatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort but at last the drawingroom party did receive an augmentation
mr elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in
mrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa
he joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them
emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr frank churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles
he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friendher fair lovely amiable friend
did she knowhad she heard any thing about her since their being at randallshe felt much anxietyhe must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably and in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat and emma was quite in charity with him
but at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on harrietsmore anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint
he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sickchamber again for the presentto entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her
she was vexed
it did appearthere was no concealing itexactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable
and she had difficulty in behaving with temper
he turned to mrs weston to implore her assistance would not she give him her supportwould not she add her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs goddards till it were certain that miss smiths disorder had no infection
he could not be satisfied without a promisewould not she give him her influence in procuring it  so scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless for herself
she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home today and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself
is this fair mrs westonjudge between us
have not i some right to complain
i am sure of your kind support and aid  emma saw mrs westons surprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose
she could only give him a look but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving her all her attention
she had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for mr john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind concluding with these words to mr woodhouse  this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir
something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow  poor mr woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer
mrs weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his soninlaw who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly
i admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing out in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow very soon
every body must have seen the snow coming on
i admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well
another hour or twos snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand
i dare say we shall be all safe at hartfield before midnight  mr weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away
as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty
he wished the road might be impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls and with the utmost goodwill was sure that accommodation might be found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him that with a little contrivance every body might be lodged which she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house
what is to be done my dear emmawhat is to be done was mr woodhouses first exclamation and all that he could say for some time
to her he looked for comfort and her assurances of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses and of james and of their having so many friends about them revived him a little
his eldest daughters alarm was equal to his own
the horror of being blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain at randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them
you had better order the carriage directly my love said she i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk
i am not at all afraid
i should not mind walking half the way
i could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold  indeed replied he
then my dear isabella it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every thing does give you cold
walk homeyou are prettily shod for walking home i dare say
it will be bad enough for the horses  isabella turned to mrs weston for her approbation of the plan
mrs weston could only approve
isabella then went to emma but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away and they were still discussing the point when mr knightley who had left the room immediately after his brothers first report of the snow came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence
he had gone beyond the sweepsome way along the highbury roadthe snow was nowhere above half an inch deepin many places hardly enough to whiten the ground a very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting and there was every appearance of its being soon over
he had seen the coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend
to isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were scarcely less acceptable to emma on her fathers account who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at randalls
he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending mr knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences thus  your father will not be easy why do not you go  i am ready if the others are  shall i ring the bell  yes do  and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for
a few minutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over
the carriage came and mr woodhouse always the first object on such occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr knightley and mr weston but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for
he was afraid they should have a very bad drive
he was afraid poor isabella would not like it
and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind
he did not know what they had best do
they must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage
isabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally so that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them and that they were to have a ttette drive
it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked to him of harriet and the threequarters of a mile would have seemed but one
but now she would rather it had not happened
she believed he had been drinking too much of mr westons good wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense
to restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they passed the sweepgate and joined the other carriage than she found her subject cut upher hand seizedher attention demanded and mr elton actually making violent love to her availing himself of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known hopingfearingadoringready to die if she refused him but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible
it really was so
without scruplewithout apologywithout much apparent diffidence mr elton the lover of harriet was professing himself her lover
she tried to stop him but vainly he would go on and say it all
angry as she was the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak
she felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour
accordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she hoped would best suit his half and half state she replied  i am very much astonished mr elton
this to me
you forget yourselfyou take me for my friendany message to miss smith i shall be happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please  miss smithmessage to miss smithwhat could she possibly meanand he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful pretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness  mr
elton this is the most extraordinary conduct
and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner
command yourself enough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it  but mr elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits not at all to confuse his intellects
he perfectly knew his own meaning and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious and slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friendbut acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned at allhe resumed the subject of his own passion and was very urgent for a favourable answer
as she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied  it is impossible for me to doubt any longer
you have made yourself too clear
mr elton my astonishment is much beyond any thing i can express
after such behaviour as i have witnessed during the last month to miss smithsuch attentions as i have been in the daily habit of observingto be addressing me in this mannerthis is an unsteadiness of character indeed which i had not supposed possible
believe me sir i am far very far from gratified in being the object of such professions  good heaven cried mr elton what can be the meaning of thismiss smithi never thought of miss smith in the whole course of my existencenever paid her any attentions but as your friend never cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend
if she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her and i am very sorryextremely sorrybut miss smith indeedoh
miss woodhouse
who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse is near
no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character
i have thought only of you
i protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else
every thing that i have said or done for many weeks past has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself
you cannot really seriously doubt it
noin an accent meant to be insinuatingi am sure you have seen and understood me  it would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing thiswhich of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost
she was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr eltons sanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed  charming miss woodhouse
allow me to interpret this interesting silence
it confesses that you have long understood me  no sir cried emma it confesses no such thing
so far from having long understood you i have been in a most complete error with respect to your views till this moment
as to myself i am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelingsnothing could be farther from my wishesyour attachment to my friend harrietyour pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me great pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success but had i supposed that she were not your attraction to hartfield i should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent
am i to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to miss smiththat you have never thought seriously of her  never madam cried he affronted in his turn never i assure you
i think seriously of miss smithmiss smith is a very good sort of girl and i should be happy to see her respectably settled
i wish her extremely well and no doubt there are men who might not object toevery body has their level but as for myself i am not i think quite so much at a loss
i need not so totally despair of an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smithno madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only and the encouragement i received  encouragementi give you encouragementsir you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it
i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend
in no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance
i am exceedingly sorry but it is well that the mistake ends where it does
had the same behaviour continued miss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views not being aware probably any more than myself of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of
but as it is the disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting
i have no thoughts of matrimony at present  he was too angry to say another word her manner too decided to invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment and mutually deep mortification they had to continue together a few minutes longer for the fears of mr woodhouse had confined them to a footpace
if there had not been so much anger there would have been desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment
without knowing when the carriage turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped they found themselves all at once at the door of his house and he was out before another syllable passedemma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night
the compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to hartfield
there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage laneturning a corner which he could never bear to think ofand in strange handsa mere common coachmanno james and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well for mr john knightley ashamed of his illhumour was now all kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father as to seemif not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruelperfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herselfbut her mind had never been in such perturbation and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection
the hair was curled and the maid sent away and emma sat down to think and be miserableit was a wretched business indeedsuch an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing forsuch a development of every thing most unwelcomesuch a blow for harrietthat was the worst of all
every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort or other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistakenmore in errormore disgraced by misjudgment than she actually was could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself
if i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have borne any thing
he might have doubled his presumption to mebut poor harriet  how she could have been so deceivedhe protested that he had never thought seriously of harrietnever
she looked back as well as she could but it was all confusion
she had taken up the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it
his manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious or she could not have been so misled
the picturehow eager he had been about the pictureand the charadeand an hundred other circumstanceshow clearly they had seemed to point at harriet
to be sure the charade with its ready witbut then the soft eyesin fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth
who could have seen through such thickheaded nonsense
certainly she had often especially of late thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way as a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the gentleness of his address true elegance was sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never for an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harriets friend
to mr john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject for the first start of its possibility
there was no denying that those brothers had penetration
she remembered what mr knightley had once said to her about mr elton the caution he had given the conviction he had professed that mr elton would never marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself
it was dreadfully mortifying but mr elton was proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full of his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others
contrary to the usual course of things mr eltons wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion
his professions and his proposals did him no service
she thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes
he wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for
there had been no real affection either in his language or manners
sighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could hardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice less allied with real love
she need not trouble herself to pity him
he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty or with ten
butthat he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to marry himshould suppose himself her equal in connexion or mindlook down upon her friend so well understanding the gradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing herit was most provoking
perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind
the very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior
he must know that the woodhouses had been settled for several generations at hartfield the younger branch of a very ancient familyand that the eltons were nobody
the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself in every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civilitybut he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy like mr elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite
if she had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder that he with selfinterest to blind him should have mistaken hers
the first error and the worst lay at her door
it was foolish it was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two people together
it was adventuring too far assuming too much making light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought to be simple
she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more
here have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being very much attached to this man
she might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as i used to think him
oh
that i had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young martin
there i was quite right
that was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left the rest to time and chance
i was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having i ought not to have attempted more
but now poor girl her peace is cut up for some time
i have been but half a friend to her and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am sure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for herwilliam coxeoh
no i could not endure william coxea pert young lawyer  she stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed a more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been and might be and must be
the distressing explanation she had to make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering with the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings concealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully
to youth and natural cheerfulness like emmas though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits
the youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope
emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it
it was a great consolation that mr elton should not be really in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint himthat harriets nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentiveand that there could be no necessity for any bodys knowing what had passed except the three principals and especially for her fathers being given a moments uneasiness about it
these were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present
the weather was most favourable for her though christmas day she could not go to church
mr woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas
the ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner
no intercourse with harriet possible but by note no church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no need to find excuses for mr eltons absenting himself
it was weather which might fairly confine every body at home and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house too wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr knightley whom no weather could keep entirely from them  ah
mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton  these days of confinement would have been but for her private perplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly suited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off his illhumour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at hartfield
he was always agreeable and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body
but with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease
mr and mrs john knightley were not detained long at hartfield
the weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move and mr woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole party set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor isabellawhich poor isabella passing her life with those she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults and always innocently busy might have been a model of right feminine happiness
the evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from mr elton to mr woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note to say with mr eltons best compliments that he was proposing to leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath where in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends he had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted the impossibility he was under from various circumstances of weather and business of taking a personal leave of mr woodhouse of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful senseand had mr woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them  emma was most agreeably surprizedmr
eltons absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired
she admired him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced
resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father from which she was so pointedly excluded
she had not even a share in his opening complimentsher name was not mentionedand there was so striking a change in all this and such an illjudged solemnity of leavetaking in his graceful acknowledgments as she thought at first could not escape her fathers suspicion
it did howeverher father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey and his fears that mr elton might never get safely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language
it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening
mr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude
she now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark
she had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentlemans return
she went to mrs goddards accordingly the very next day to undergo the necessary penance of communication and a severe one it wasshe had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feedingto appear in the ungracious character of the one preferredand acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and misjudging in all her ideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions all her prophecies for the last six weeks
the confession completely renewed her first shameand the sight of harriets tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again
harriet bore the intelligence very wellblaming nobodyand in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend
emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost and all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching seemed on harriets side not her own
harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of
the affection of such a man as mr elton would have been too great a distinctionshe never could have deserved himand nobody but so partial and kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible
her tears fell abundantlybut her grief was so truly artless that no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmas eyesand she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understandingreally for the time convinced that harriet was the superior creature of the twoand that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do
it was rather too late in the day to set about being simpleminded and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of her life
her second duty now inferior only to her fathers claims was to promote harriets comfort and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by matchmaking
she got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness striving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation to drive mr elton from her thoughts
time she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr elton in particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriets age and with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of mr eltons return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them
harriet did think him all perfection and maintained the nonexistence of any body equal to him in person or goodnessand did in truth prove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen but yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force
if mr elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine harriets persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him
their being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad for each for all three
not one of them had the power of removal or of effecting any material change of society
they must encounter each other and make the best of it
harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at mrs goddards mr elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth
where the wound had been given there must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace for herself
mr frank churchill did not come
when the time proposed drew near mrs westons fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse
for the present he could not be spared to his very great mortification and regret but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period  mrs weston was exceedingly disappointedmuch more disappointed in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober but a sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression
it soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again
for half an hour mr weston was surprized and sorry but then he began to perceive that franks coming two or three months later would be a much better plan better time of year better weather and that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner
these feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs weston of a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer suffered a great deal more herself
emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr frank churchills not coming except as a disappointment at randalls
the acquaintance at present had no charm for her
she wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it was desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance and enter as warmly into mr and mrs westons disappointment as might naturally belong to their friendship
she was the first to announce it to mr knightley and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps rather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away
she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry the pleasure of looking at somebody new the galaday to highbury entire which the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections on the churchills again found herself directly involved in a disagreement with mr knightley and to her great amusement perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion and making use of mrs westons arguments against herself
the churchills are very likely in fault said mr knightley coolly but i dare say he might come if he would  i do not know why you should say so
he wishes exceedingly to come but his uncle and aunt will not spare him  i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made a point of it
it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof  how odd you are
what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature  i am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it
it is a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young man brought up by those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud luxurious and selfish too
if frank churchill had wanted to see his father he would have contrived it between september and january
a man at his agewhat is hethree or fourandtwentycannot be without the means of doing as much as that
it is impossible  thats easily said and easily felt by you who have always been your own master
you are the worst judge in the world mr knightley of the difficulties of dependence
you do not know what it is to have tempers to manage  it is not to be conceived that a man of three or fourandtwenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount
he cannot want moneyhe cannot want leisure
we know on the contrary that he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom
we hear of him for ever at some wateringplace or other
a little while ago he was at weymouth
this proves that he can leave the churchills  yes sometimes he can  and those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while whenever there is any temptation of pleasure  it is very unfair to judge of any bodys conduct without an intimate knowledge of their situation
nobody who has not been in the interior of a family can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be
we ought to be acquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchills temper before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do
he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others  there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution
it is frank churchills duty to pay this attention to his father
he knows it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done
a man who felt rightly would say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchillevery sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately
i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion
i shall therefore set off tomorrowif he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no opposition made to his going  no said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again
such language for a young man entirely dependent to usenobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible
but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own
mr frank churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up and are to provide for himstanding up in the middle of the room i suppose and speaking as loud as he couldhow can you imagine such conduct practicable  depend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it
he would feel himself in the right and the declarationmade of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper mannerwould do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do
respect would be added to affection
they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims
respect for right conduct is felt by every body
if he would act in this sort of manner on principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend to his  i rather doubt that
you are very fond of bending little minds but where little minds belong to rich people in authority i think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones
i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchills situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect
the churchills might not have a word to say in return but then you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through
to him who has it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought
he may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have without being so equal under particular circumstances to act up to it  then it would not be so strong a sense
if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction  oh the difference of situation and habit
i wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life  our amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others
it ought to have been a habit with him by this time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency
i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man
as he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority
he ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father
had he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now  we shall never agree about him cried emma but that is nothing extraordinary
i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not
mr weston would not be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely to have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit your notions of mans perfection
i dare say he has and though it may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others  yes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it
he can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his fathers having any right to complain
his letters disgust me  your feelings are singular
they seem to satisfy every body else  i suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston
they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings standing in a mothers place but without a mothers affection to blind her
it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission
had she been a person of consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would not have signified whether he did or no
can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations
do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself
no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english
he may be very amiable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him  you seem determined to think ill of him  menot at all replied mr knightley rather displeased i do not want to think ill of him
i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is wellgrown and goodlooking with smooth plausible manners  well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury
we do not often look upon fine young men wellbred and agreeable
we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain
cannot you imagine mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce
there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interestone object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else  you will excuse my being so much overpowered
if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts  my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable
to you he will talk of farming to me of drawing or music and so on to every body having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead or take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak extremely well on each that is my idea of him  and mine said mr knightley warmly is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing
what
at threeandtwenty to be the king of his companythe great manthe practised politician who is to read every bodys character and make every bodys talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself
my dear emma your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point  i will say no more about him cried emma you turn every thing to evil
we are both prejudiced you against i for him and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here  prejudiced
i am not prejudiced  but i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it
my love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour  he is a person i never think of from one months end to another said mr knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma immediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend why he should be angry
to take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him for with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid to his charge she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another
volume ii       emma and harriet had been walking together one morning and in emmas opinion had been talking enough of mr elton for that day
she could not think that harriets solace or her own sins required more and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returnedbut it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintivemr
elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done
they were just approaching the house where lived mrs and miss bates
she determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers
there was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs and miss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts
she had had many a hint from mr knightley and some from her own heart as to her deficiencybut none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeablea waste of timetiresome womenand all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the secondrate and thirdrate of highbury who were calling on them for ever and therefore she seldom went near them
but now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going inobserving as she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate they were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax
the house belonged to people in business
mrs and miss bates occupied the drawingroom floor and there in the very moderatesized apartment which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr woodhouses health cheerful communications about her mothers and sweetcake from the beaufetmrs
cole had just been there just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an hour with them and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss woodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too  the mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr elton
there was intimacy between them and mr cole had heard from mr elton since his going away
emma knew what was coming they must have the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone and how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he was wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies ball had been and she went through it very well with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always putting forward to prevent harriets being obliged to say a word
this she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury and their cardparties
she had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr elton but he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the coles to usher in a letter from her niece
oh
yesmr
elton i understandcertainly as to dancingmrs
cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath wasmrs
cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane for as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her jane is so very great a favourite there
whenever she is with us mrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough and i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can
and so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time for writing and when i immediately said but indeed we have we had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized
have you upon your honour said she well that is quite unexpected
do let me hear what she says  emmas politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest  have you heard from miss fairfax so lately
i am extremely happy
i hope she is well  thank you
you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt while eagerly hunting for the letteroh
here it is
i was sure it could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand so very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table
i was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was reading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to hera letter from janethat she can never hear it often enough so i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under my huswifeand since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she saysbut first of all i really must in justice to jane apologise for her writing so short a letteronly two pages you seehardly twoand in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half
my mother often wonders that i can make it out so well
she often says when the letter is first opened well hetty now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checkerworkdont you maamand then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for herevery word of iti am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word
and indeed though my mothers eyes are not so good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god
with the help of spectacles
it is such a blessing
my mothers are really very good indeed
jane often says when she is here i am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see as you doand so much fine work as you have done tooi only wish my eyes may last me as well  all this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath and emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss fairfaxs handwriting
you are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified you who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself
i am sure there is nobodys praise that could give us so much pleasure as miss woodhouses
my mother does not hear she is a little deaf you know
maam addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about janes handwriting  and emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it
she was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming very rude of making her escape from jane fairfaxs letter and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse when miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention
my mothers deafness is very trifling you seejust nothing at all
by only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over she is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice
but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me
jane speaks so distinct
however she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great deal at my mothers time of lifeand it really is full two years you know since she was here
we never were so long without seeing her before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now  are you expecting miss fairfax here soon  oh yes next week  indeedthat must be a very great pleasure  thank you
you are very kind
yes next week
every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things
i am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they can be to see her
yes friday or saturday she cannot say which because colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days
so very good of them to send her the whole way
but they always do you know
oh yes friday or saturday next
that is what she writes about
that is the reason of her writing out of rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have heard from her before next tuesday or wednesday  yes so i imagined
i was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of miss fairfax today  so obliging of you
no we should not have heard if it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon
my mother is so delightedfor she is to be three months with us at least
three months she says so positively as i am going to have the pleasure of reading to you
the case is you see that the campbells are going to ireland
mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly
they had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so impatient to see them againfor till she married last october she was never away from them so much as a week which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say but however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her motheror her father i declare i do not know which it was but we shall see presently in janes letterwrote in mr dixons name as well as her own to press their coming over directly and they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back to their country seat balycraig a beautiful place i fancy
jane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i meani do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was very natural you know that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addressesand as jane used to be very often walking out with themfor colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughters not walking out often with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them of course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell about his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he had taken himself
he is a most amiable charming young man i believe
jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account of things  at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emmas brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr dixon and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery  you must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time
considering the very particular friendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell  very true very true indeed
the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months togethernot able to come if any thing was to happen
but you see every thing turns out for the best
they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to come over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation jane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention
he is a most charming young man
ever since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails would have been dashed into the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not with the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit i can never think of it without trembling
but ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon  but in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish of seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and mrs bates  yesentirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel and mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they should recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try her native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately  i am concerned to hear of it
i think they judge wisely
but mrs dixon must be very much disappointed
mrs dixon i understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not by any means to be compared with miss fairfax  oh
no
you are very obliging to say such thingsbut certainly not
there is no comparison between them
miss campbell always was absolutely plainbut extremely elegant and amiable  yes that of course  jane caught a bad cold poor thing
so long ago as the th of november as i am going to read to you and has never been well since
a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her
she never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us
just like her
so consideratebut however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure herand it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell
nobody could nurse her as we should do  it appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world  and so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the campbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday followingas you will find from janes letter
so suddenyou may guess dear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in
if it was not for the drawback of her illnessbut i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly
i must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that
i always make a point of reading janes letters through to myself first before i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her
jane desired me to do it so i always do and so i began today with my usual caution but no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i burst out quite frightened with bless me
poor jane is illwhich my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at
however when i read on i found it was not near so bad as i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her that she does not think much about it
but i cannot imagine how i could be so off my guard
if jane does not get well soon we will call in mr perry
the expense shall not be thought of and though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so you know
he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time
well now i have just given you a hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it for her  i am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet and beginning to risemy father will be expecting us
i had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than five minutes when i first entered the house
i merely called because i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates but i have been so pleasantly detained
now however we must wish you and mrs bates good morning  and not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded
she regained the streethappy in this that though much had been forced on her against her will though she had in fact heard the whole substance of jane fairfaxs letter she had been able to escape the letter itself
jane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs batess youngest daughter
the marriage of lieut
fairfax of the regiment of infantry and miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure hope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroadof his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwardsand this girl
by birth she belonged to highbury and when at three years old on losing her mother she became the property the charge the consolation the foundling of her grandmother and aunt there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there of her being taught only what very limited means could command and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person good understanding and warmhearted wellmeaning relations
but the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny
this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for such attentions during a severe campfever as he believed had saved his life
these were claims which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in his power
when he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her
he was a married man with only one living child a girl about janes age and jane became their guest paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old his daughters great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education
it was accepted and from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbells family and had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother from time to time
the plan was that she should be brought up for educating others the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible
to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbells power for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughters but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter
such was jane fairfaxs history
she had fallen into good hands known nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given an excellent education
living constantly with rightminded and wellinformed people her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbells residence being in london every lighter talent had been done full justice to by the attendance of firstrate masters
her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children fully competent to the office of instruction herself but she was too much beloved to be parted with
neither father nor mother could promote and the daughter could not endure it
the evil day was put off
it was easy to decide that she was still too young and jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious mixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over
the affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss campbell in particular was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of janes decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements
that nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents
they continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn
this event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning
she had long resolved that oneandtwenty should be the period
with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate she had resolved at oneandtwenty to complete the sacrifice and retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse equal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever
the good sense of colonel and mrs campbell could not oppose such a resolution though their feelings did
as long as they lived no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly but this would be selfishnesswhat must be at last had better be soon
perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished
still however affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment
she had never been quite well since the time of their daughters marriage and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength they must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed under the most favourable circumstances to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort
with regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some truths not told
it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else
certain it was that she was to come and that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised itmr
frank churchillmust put up for the present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness of a two years absence
emma was sorryto have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long monthsto be always doing more than she wished and less than she ought
why she did not like jane fairfax might be a difficult question to answer mr knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time there were moments of selfexamination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her
but she could never get acquainted with her she did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reservesuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or notand then her aunt was such an eternal talkerand she was made such a fuss with by every bodyand it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimatebecause their ages were the same every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other these were her reasonsshe had no better
it was a dislike so little justevery imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any considerable absence without feeling that she had injured her and now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years interval she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating
jane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had herself the highest value for elegance
her height was pretty just such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could think very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most becoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance of illhealth seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two
emma could not but feel all this and then her faceher featuresthere was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered it was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty
her eyes a deep grey with dark eyelashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom
it was a style of beauty of which elegance was the reigning character and as such she must in honour by all her principles admire itelegance which whether of person or of mind she saw so little in highbury
there not to be vulgar was distinction and merit
in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike her no longer
when she took in her history indeed her situation as well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance was destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going to live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect especially if to every wellknown particular entitling her to interest were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to mr dixon which she had so naturally started to herself
in that case nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on
emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced mr dixons affections from his wife or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first
if it were love it might be simple single successless love on her side alone
she might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison while a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit to ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty
upon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings as made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her
these were charming feelingsbut not lasting
before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for jane fairfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors than saying to mr knightley she certainly is handsome she is better than handsome jane had spent an evening at hartfield with her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state
former provocations reappeared
the aunt was as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself and janes offences rose again
they had music emma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance
she was besides which was the worst of all so cold so cautious
there was no getting at her real opinion
wrapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined to hazard nothing
she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved
if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing
she seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr dixons character or her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness of the match
it was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished
it did her no service however
her caution was thrown away
emma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises
there probably was something more to conceal than her own preference mr dixon perhaps had been very near changing one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds
the like reserve prevailed on other topics
she and mr frank churchill had been at weymouth at the same time
it was known that they were a little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could emma procure as to what he truly was
was he handsomeshe believed he was reckoned a very fine young man was he agreeablehe was generally thought so did he appear a sensible young man a young man of informationat a wateringplace or in a common london acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points
manners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill
she believed every body found his manners pleasing emma could not forgive her
emma could not forgive herbut as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma
he had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement
a very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers swept awayparticularly pleasant
you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music
i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at ones ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation
i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma
you left nothing undone
i was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument at her grandmothers it must have been a real indulgence  i am happy you approved said emma smiling but i hope i am not often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield  no my dear said her father instantly that i am sure you are not
there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are
if any thing you are too attentive
the muffin last nightif it had been handed round once i think it would have been enough  no said mr knightley nearly at the same time you are not often deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension
i think you understand me therefore  an arch look expressedi understand you well enough but she said only miss fairfax is reserved  i always told you she wasa little but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that has its foundation in diffidence
what arises from discretion must be honoured  you think her diffident
i do not see it  my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening  oh
no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions and amused to think how little information i obtained  i am disappointed was his only answer
i hope every body had a pleasant evening said mr woodhouse in his quiet way
i had
once i felt the fire rather too much but then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did not disturb me
miss bates was very chatty and goodhumoured as she always is though she speaks rather too quick
however she is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way
i like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady a very pretty and a very wellbehaved young lady indeed
she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma  true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax  emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question  she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep ones eyes from
i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart  mr knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express and before he could make any reply mr woodhouse whose thoughts were on the batess said  it is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined
a great pity indeed
and i have often wishedbut it is so little one can venture to dosmall trifling presents of any thing uncommonnow we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg it is very small and delicatehartfield pork is not like any other porkbut still it is porkand my dear emma unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it for no stomach can bear roast porki think we had better send the legdo not you think so my dear  my dear papa i sent the whole hindquarter
i knew you would wish it
there will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like  thats right my dear very right
i had not thought of it before but that is the best way
they must not oversalt the leg and then if it is not oversalted and if it is very thoroughly boiled just as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a boiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider it unwholesome  emma said mr knightley presently i have a piece of news for you
you like newsand i heard an article in my way hither that i think will interest you  news
oh
yes i always like news
what is itwhy do you smile sowhere did you hear itat randalls  he had time only to say  no not at randalls i have not been near randalls when the door was thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room
full of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to give quickest
mr knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him
oh
my dear sir how are you this morning
my dear miss woodhousei come quite overpowered
such a beautiful hindquarter of pork
you are too bountiful
have you heard the news
mr elton is going to be married  emma had not had time even to think of mr elton and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start and a little blush at the sound
there is my newsi thought it would interest you said mr knightley with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them
but where could you hear it cried miss bates
where could you possibly hear it mr knightley
for it is not five minutes since i received mrs coles noteno it cannot be more than fiveor at least tenfor i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready to come outi was only gone down to speak to patty again about the porkjane was standing in the passagewere not you janefor my mother was so afraid that we had not any saltingpan large enough
so i said i would go down and see and jane said shall i go down instead
for i think you have a little cold and patty has been washing the kitchenoh
my dear said iwell and just then came the note
a miss hawkinsthats all i know
a miss hawkins of bath
but mr knightley how could you possibly have heard it
for the very moment mr cole told mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me
a miss hawkins  i was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago
he had just read eltons letter as i was shewn in and handed it to me directly  well
that is quitei suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting
my dear sir you really are too bountiful
my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her  we consider our hartfield pork replied mr woodhouseindeed it certainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i cannot have a greater pleasure than  oh
my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good to us
if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us
we may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage well mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well  it was shortmerely to announcebut cheerful exulting of course here was a sly glance at emma
he had been so fortunate as toi forget the precise wordsone has no business to remember them
the information was as you state that he was going to be married to a miss hawkins
by his style i should imagine it just settled  mr
elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak
he will have every bodys wishes for his happiness  he is very young to settle was mr woodhouses observation
he had better not be in a hurry
he seemed to me very well off as he was
we were always glad to see him at hartfield  a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates joyfully my mother is so pleasedshe says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress
this is great news indeed
jane you have never seen mr eltonno wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him  janes curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her
noi have never seen mr elton she replied starting on this appeal is heis he a tall man  who shall answer that question cried emma
my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is just the happy medium
when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind  very true miss woodhouse so she will
he is the very best young manbut my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday he was precisely the height of mr perry
miss hawkinsi dare say an excellent young woman
his extreme attention to my motherwanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better for my mother is a little deaf you knowit is not much but she does not hear quite quick
jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf
he fancied bathing might be good for itthe warm bathbut she says it did him no lasting benefit
colonel campbell you know is quite our angel
and mr dixon seems a very charming young man quite worthy of him
it is such a happiness when good people get togetherand they always do
now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrysi suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry
i say sir turning to mr woodhouse i think there are few places with such society as highbury
i always say we are quite blessed in our neighboursmy dear sir if there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is porka roast loin of pork  as to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been acquainted with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known
one feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance
he has been gone only four weeks  nobody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings emma said  you are silent miss fairfaxbut i hope you mean to take an interest in this news
you who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep in the business on miss campbells accountwe shall not excuse your being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins  when i have seen mr elton replied jane i dare say i shall be interestedbut i believe it requires that with me
and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off  yes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse said miss bates four weeks yesterdaya miss hawkinswell i had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts not that i evermrs
cole once whispered to mebut i immediately said no mr elton is a most worthy young manbutin short i do not think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries
i do not pretend to it
what is before me i see
at the same time nobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspiredmiss woodhouse lets me chatter on so goodhumouredly
she knows i would not offend for the world
how does miss smith do
she seems quite recovered now
have you heard from mrs john knightley lately
oh
those dear little children
jane do you know i always fancy mr dixon like mr john knightley
i mean in persontall and with that sort of lookand not very talkative  quite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all  very odd
but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand
one takes up a notion and runs away with it
mr dixon you say is not strictly speaking handsome  handsome
oh
nofar from itcertainly plain
i told you he was plain  my dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain and that you yourself  oh
as for me my judgment is worth nothing
where i have a regard i always think a person welllooking
but i gave what i believed the general opinion when i called him plain  well my dear jane i believe we must be running away
the weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy
you are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must take leave
this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed
i shall just go round by mrs coles but i shall not stop three minutes and jane you had better go home directlyi would not have you out in a showerwe think she is the better for highbury already
thank you we do indeed
i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork when we dress the leg it will be another thing
good morning to you my dear sir
oh
mr knightley is coming too
well that is so veryi am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to give her your armmr
elton and miss hawkinsgood morning to you  emma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marryand to marry strangers tooand the other half she could give to her own view of the subject
it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr elton could not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet harriet must feel itand all that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others
it was now about the time that she was likely to call
if she were to meet miss bates in her wayand upon its beginning to rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs goddards and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation
the shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the oh
miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation
as the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly through what she had to tell
she had set out from mrs goddards half an hour agoshe had been afraid it would rainshe had been afraid it would pour down every momentbut she thought she might get to hartfield firstshe had hurried on as fast as possible but then as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her she thought she would just step in and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain and she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast as she could and took shelter at fordsfords was the principal woollendraper linendraper and haberdashers shop united the shop first in size and fashion in the placeand so there she had set without an idea of any thing in the world full ten minutes perhapswhen all of a sudden who should come into be sure it was so very oddbut they always dealt at fordswho should come in but elizabeth martin and her brotherdear miss woodhouse
only think
i thought i should have fainted
i did not know what to do
i was sitting near the doorelizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella
i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the dooroh
dear i was so miserable
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown
i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but thereoh
dear miss woodhousewell at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another
i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to medo you think he was miss woodhouse
for presently she came forwardcame quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would
she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i saidi was in such a tremblei remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind
dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable
by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting awayand thenonly thinki found he was coming up towards me tooslowly you know and as if he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke and i answeredand i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully you know one cant tell how and then i took courage and said it did not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got three yards from the door when he came after me only to say if i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round by mr coles stables for i should find the near way quite floated by this rain
oh
dear i thought it would have been the death of me
so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stablesi believe i didbut i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it
oh
miss woodhouse i would rather done any thing than have it happen and yet you know there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly
and elizabeth too
oh
miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again  very sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in her power
she was obliged to stop and think
she was not thoroughly comfortable herself
the young mans conduct and his sisters seemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them
as harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour
but she had believed them to be wellmeaning worthy people before and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion
it was folly to be disturbed by it
of course he must be sorry to lose herthey must be all sorry
ambition as well as love had probably been mortified
they might all have hoped to rise by harriets acquaintance and besides what was the value of harriets descriptionso easily pleasedso little discerningwhat signified her praise
she exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite unworthy of being dwelt on  it might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem to have behaved extremely well and it is overand may nevercan never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need not think about it  harriet said very true and she would not think about it but still she talked of itstill she could talk of nothing else and emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head was obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state of mind in poor harrietsuch a conclusion of mr eltons importance with her
mr eltons rights however gradually revived
though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy
emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting
it had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining any influence to alarm
as harriet now lived the martins could not get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her refusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs goddards and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again with any necessity or even any power of speech
human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations that a young person who either marries or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of
a week had not passed since miss hawkinss name was first mentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind to be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable and when mr elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects and circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more for him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose music she principally played
mr elton returned a very happy man
he had gone away rejected and mortifieddisappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing the right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one
he had gone away deeply offendedhe came back engaged to anotherand to another as superior of course to the first as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost
he came back gay and selfsatisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse and defying miss smith
the charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune of so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of some dignity as well as some convenience the story told well he had not thrown himself awayhe had gained a woman of  l
or thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapiditythe first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so gloriousthe steps so quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr greens and the party at mrs brownssmiles and blushes rising in importancewith consciousness and agitation richly scatteredthe lady had been so easily impressedso sweetly disposedhad in short to use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him that vanity and prudence were equally contented
he had caught both substance and shadowboth fortune and affection and was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself and his own concernsexpecting to be congratulatedready to be laughed atand with cordial fearless smiles now addressing all the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago he would have been more cautiously gallant
the wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves to please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for and when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation which a certain glance of mrs coles did not seem to contradict that when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride
during his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension now spread over his air
she was in fact beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again
she wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction
the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly be lessened by his marriage
many vain solicitudes would be preventedmany awkwardnesses smoothed by it
a mrs elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark
it would be almost beginning their life of civility again
of the lady individually emma thought very little
she was good enough for mr elton no doubt accomplished enough for highburyhandsome enoughto look plain probably by harriets side
as to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet he had done nothing
on that article truth seemed attainable
what she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out and setting aside the  l it did not appear that she was at all harriets superior
she brought no name no blood no alliance
miss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristolmerchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also
part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath but bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though the father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remainedin the law linenothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter had lived
emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney and too stupid to rise
and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister who was very well married to a gentleman in a great way near bristol who kept two carriages
that was the windup of the history that was the glory of miss hawkins
could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all
she had talked her into love but alas
she was not so easily to be talked out of it
the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriets mind was not to be talked away
he might be superseded by another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer even a robert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else she feared would cure her
harriet was one of those who having once begun would be always in love
and now poor girl
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr elton
she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other
emma saw him only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure just to meet with him or just to miss him just to hear his voice or see his shoulder just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture
she was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when at hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr elton and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns and every report therefore every guessall that had already occurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs comprehending income servants and furniture was continually in agitation around her
her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkinss happiness and continual observation of how much he seemed attachedhis air as he walked by the housethe very sitting of his hat being all in proof of how much he was in love
had it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain to her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of harriets mind emma would have been amused by its variations
sometimes mr elton predominated sometimes the martins and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other
mr eltons engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr martin
the unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by elizabeth martins calling at mrs goddards a few days afterwards
harriet had not been at home but a note had been prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch a small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness and till mr elton himself appeared she had been much occupied by it continually pondering over what could be done in return and wishing to do more than she dared to confess
but mr elton in person had driven away all such cares
while he staid the martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return elizabeth martins visit
how that visit was to be acknowledgedwhat would be necessaryand what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful consideration
absolute neglect of the mother and sisters when invited to come would be ingratitude
it must not be and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance
after much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harriets returning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance
she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill while she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future
she could think of nothing better and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approvesomething of ingratitude merely glossed overit must be done or what would become of harriet
small heart had harriet for visiting
only half an hour before her friend called for her at mrs goddards her evil stars had led her to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to the rev
philip elton whitehart bath was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butchers cart which was to convey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world excepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank
she went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier appletrees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour
she went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell
the quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again and miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and unattended by any alarming young man
she came solitarily down the gravel walka miss martin just appearing at the door and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility
harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account
she was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating
she had seen only mrs martin and the two girls
they had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the timetill just at last when mrs martins saying all of a sudden that she thought miss smith was grown had brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner
in that very room she had been measured last september with her two friends
there were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window
he had done it
they all seemed to remember the day the hour the party the occasionto feel the same consciousness the same regretsto be ready to return to the same good understanding and they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage reappeared and all was over
the style of the visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive
fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months agoemma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally harriet must suffer
it was a bad business
she would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins in a higher rank of life
they were so deserving that a little higher should have been enough but as it was how could she have done otherwiseimpossibleshe could not repent
they must be separated but there was a great deal of pain in the processso much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls to procure it
her mind was quite sick of mr elton and the martins
the refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary
it was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both been out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield
this is too bad cried emma as they turned away
and now we shall just miss them too provokingi do not know when i have been so disappointed and she leaned back in the corner to indulge her murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of bothsuch being the commonest process of a not illdisposed mind
presently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt by mr and mrs weston who were standing to speak to her
there was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in soundfor mr weston immediately accosted her with  how dye dohow dye dowe have been sitting with your fatherglad to see him so well
frank comes tomorrowi had a letter this morningwe see him tomorrow by dinnertime to a certaintyhe is at oxford today and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would be so
if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days i was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going to have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather
we shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish  there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr westons confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not less to the purpose
to know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy
it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits
the wornout past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moments thought she hoped mr elton would now be talked of no more
mr weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command as well as the route and the method of his journey and she listened and smiled and congratulated
i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion
emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his wife
we had better move on mr weston said she we are detaining the girls  well well i am readyand turning again to emma but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinarythough his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction
emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing
think of me tomorrow my dear emma about four oclock was mrs westons parting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her
four oclockdepend upon it he will be here by three was mr westons quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting
emmas spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore a different air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before
when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there
will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxfordwas a question however which did not augur much
but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time
the morning of the interesting day arrived and mrs westons faithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve oclock that she was to think of her at four
my dear dear anxious friendsaid she in mental soliloquy while walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful for every bodys comfort but your own i see you now in all your little fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure that all is right the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall
tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time tomorrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here
i am sure they will bring him soon  she opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with her fathermr
weston and his son
they had been arrived only a few minutes and mr weston had scarcely finished his explanation of franks being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when she appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure
the frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest was actually before herhe was presented to her and she did not think too much had been said in his praise he was a very good looking young man height air address all were unexceptionable and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his fathers he looked quick and sensible
she felt immediately that she should like him and there was a wellbred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be
he had reached randalls the evening before
she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan and travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half a day
i told you yesterday cried mr weston with exultation i told you all that he would be here before the time named
i remembered what i used to do myself
one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon ones friends before the lookout begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs  it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far but in coming home i felt i might do any thing  the word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency
emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable the conviction was strengthened by what followed
he was very much pleased with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house would hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation the walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but ones own country gives and the greatest curiosity to visit it
that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously through emmas brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled
his manner had no air of study or exaggeration
he did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment
their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance
on his side were the inquirieswas she a horsewomanpleasant ridespleasant walkshad they a large neighbourhoodhighbury perhaps afforded society enoughthere were several very pretty houses in and about itballshad they ballswas it a musical society  but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his motherinlaw and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to pleaseand of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her
he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs weston but undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter
he understood what would be welcome he could be sure of little else
his fathers marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him  he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylors merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouses character than miss woodhouse miss taylors
and at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person
elegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he but i confess that considering every thing i had not expected more than a very tolerably welllooking woman of a certain age i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston  you cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings said emma were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words
dont let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman  i hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it with a gallant bow that in addressing mrs weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms  emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance
she must see more of him to understand his ways at present she only felt they were agreeable
she had no doubt of what mr weston was often thinking about
his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening
her own fathers perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance
happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing itthough always objecting to every marriage that was arranged he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them
she blessed the favouring blindness
he could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest give way to all his natural kindhearted civility in solicitous inquiries after mr frank churchills accommodation on his journey through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching coldwhich however he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night
a reasonable visit paid mr weston began to movehe must be going
he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands for mrs weston at fords but he need not hurry any body else his son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also saying  as you are going farther on business sir i will take the opportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other and therefore may as well be paid now
i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady residing in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax
i shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house though fairfax i believe is not the proper namei should rather say barnes or bates
do you know any family of that name  to be sure we do cried his father mrs
bateswe passed her housei saw miss bates at the window
true true you are acquainted with miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine girl she is
call upon her by all means  there is no necessity for my calling this morning said the young man another day would do as well but there was that degree of acquaintance at weymouth which  oh
go today go today
do not defer it
what is right to be done cannot be done too soon
and besides i must give you a hint frank any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided
you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on
if you do not call early it will be a slight  the son looked convinced
i have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she is a very elegant young woman  he agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it
if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she i think you will today
you will see her to advantage see her and hear herno i am afraid you will not hear her at all for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue  you are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you said mr woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady
she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life
they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way  my dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me  but your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown quite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses you might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk unless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street  mr frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could and his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend this is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it and as to mrs batess he may get there from the crown in a hop step and jump  they were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one and a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave
emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort
the next morning brought mr frank churchill again
he came with mrs weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially
he had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home till her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse their walk immediately fixed on highburyhe did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him he should always chuse the same
highbury that airy cheerful happylooking highbury would be his constant attractionhighbury with mrs weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him
they walked thither directly
emma had hardly expected them for mr weston who had called in for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm
she was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in company with mrs weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend
if he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it
but on seeing them together she became perfectly satisfied
it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to hernothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection
and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning
they were all three walking about together for an hour or twofirst round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury
he was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr woodhouses ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed
some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings
he begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long and which had been the home of his fathers father and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit they shewed altogether a goodwill towards highbury in general which must be very like a merit to those he was with
emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of insincere professions and that mr knightley certainly had not done him justice
their first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house though the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of posthorses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built many years ago for a ballroom and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used as suchbut such brilliant days had long passed away and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and halfgentlemen of the place
he was immediately interested
its character as a ballroom caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased
he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge none which they suggested
no it was long enough broad enough handsome enough
it would hold the very number for comfort
they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter
why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good old days of the roomshe who could do any thing in highbury
the want of proper families in the place and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied
he could not be persuaded that so many goodlooking houses as he saw around him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting and even when particulars were given and families described he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every bodys returning into their proper place the next morning
he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills
he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe
of pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference to a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind
he could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap
it was but an effusion of lively spirits
at last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown and being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged emma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had paid it
yes oh
yeshe replied i was just going to mention it
a very successful visiti saw all the three ladies and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint
if the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me
as it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit
ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before himbut there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly threequarters of an hour
the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before  and how did you think miss fairfax looking  ill very illthat is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill
but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it
ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill healtha most deplorable want of complexion  emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss fairfaxs complexion
it was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face he listened with all due deference acknowledged that he had heard many people say the samebut yet he must confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health
where features were indifferent a fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good the effect wasfortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was
well said emma there is no disputing about tasteat least you admire her except her complexion  he shook his head and laughedi cannot separate miss fairfax and her complexion  did you see her often at weymouth
were you often in the same society  at this moment they were approaching fords and he hastily exclaimed ha
this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me
he comes to highbury himself he says six days out of the seven and has always business at fords
if it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove myself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury
i must buy something at fords
it will be taking out my freedomi dare say they sell gloves  oh
yes gloves and every thing
i do admire your patriotism
you will be adored in highbury
you were very popular before you came because you were mr westons sonbut lay out half a guinea at fords and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues  they went in and while the sleek welltied parcels of mens beavers and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he saidbut i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae
do not let me lose it
i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life  i merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax and her party at weymouth  and now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a very unfair one
it is always the ladys right to decide on the degree of acquaintance
miss fairfax must already have given her accounti shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow  upon my word
you answer as discreetly as she could do herself
but her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed she is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least information about any body that i really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her  may i indeedthen i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well
i met her frequently at weymouth
i had known the campbells a little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set
colonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly warmhearted woman
i like them all  you know miss fairfaxs situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be  yesrather hesitatinglyi believe i do  you get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs weston smiling remember that i am heremr
frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfaxs situation in life
i will move a little farther off  i certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend  he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment
when the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play said frank churchill
ever hear her repeated emma
you forget how much she belongs to highbury
i have heard her every year of our lives since we both began
she plays charmingly  you think so do youi wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge
she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myselfi am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any bodys performancei have been used to hear hers admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play wella man a very musical man and in love with another womanengaged to heron the point of marriagewould yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down insteadnever seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other
that i thought in a man of known musical talent was some proof  proof indeed said emma highly amusedmr
dixon is very musical is he
we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year  yes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought it a very strong proof  certainlyvery strong it was to own the truth a great deal stronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all agreeable to me
i could not excuse a mans having more music than lovemore ear than eyea more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings
how did miss campbell appear to like it  it was her very particular friend you know  poor comfort said emma laughing
one would rather have a stranger preferred than ones very particular friendwith a stranger it might not recur againbut the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneselfpoor mrs dixon
well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland  you are right
it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it  so much the betteror so much the worsei do not know which
but be it sweetness or be it stupidity in herquickness of friendship or dulness of feelingthere was one person i think who must have felt it miss fairfax herself
she must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction  as to thati do not  oh
do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfaxs sensations from you or from any body else
they are known to no human being i guess but herself
but if she continued to play whenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses  there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really werehow it might all be behind the scenes
i can only say that there was smoothness outwardly
but you who have known miss fairfax from a child must be a better judge of her character and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be  i have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children and women together and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimatethat we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends
but we never did
i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set
and then her reservei never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved  it is a most repulsive quality indeed said he
oftentimes very convenient no doubt but never pleasing
there is safety in reserve but no attraction
one cannot love a reserved person  not till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction may be the greater
but i must be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of conquering any bodys reserve to procure one
intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question
i have no reason to think ill of hernot the leastexcept that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal  he perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting
he was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected
his ideas seemed more moderatehis feelings warmer
she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr eltons house which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with
no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having
if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house
there must be ample room in it for every real comfort
the man must be a blockhead who wanted more
mrs weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about
used only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one
but emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives
he might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeepers room or a bad butlers pantry but no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make him happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment
emmas very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken the following day by hearing that he was gone off to london merely to have his hair cut
a sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to return to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut
there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve
it did not accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense or even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday
vanity extravagance love of change restlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs weston indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became liable to all these charges
his father only called him a coxcomb and thought it a very good story but that mrs weston did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible and making no other comment than that all young people would have their little whims  with the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him
mrs weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himselfhow much she saw to like in his disposition altogether
he appeared to have a very open tempercertainly a very cheerful and lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions a great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard was fond of talking of himsaid he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself and though there was no being attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect
this was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him the honour if not of being really in love with her of being at least very near it and saved only by her own indifferencefor still her resolution held of never marryingthe honour in short of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance
mr weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must have some weight
he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremelythought her very beautiful and very charming and with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must not judge him harshly
as mrs weston observed all young people would have their little whims  there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so leniently disposed
in general he was judged throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young manone who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit among them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows or smilesmr
knightley
the circumstance was told him at hartfield for the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand hum
just the trifling silly fellow i took him for she had half a mind to resent but an instants observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass
although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings mr and mrs westons visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune
something occurred while they were at hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was still more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave
this was the occurrencethe coles had been settled some years in highbury and were very good sort of peoplefriendly liberal and unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin in trade and only moderately genteel
on their first coming into the country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of meansthe house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them
with their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company
they added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield
their love of society and their new diningroom prepared every body for their keeping dinnercompany and a few parties chiefly among the single men had already taken place
the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to inviteneither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls
nothing should tempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her fathers known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish
the coles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them
this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from herself she had little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston
but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her very differently affected
donwell and randalls had received their invitation and none had come for her father and herself and mrs westons accounting for it with i suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out was not quite sufficient
she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept
harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses
they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence
might not the evening end in a dance
had been a question of his
the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits and her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort
it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful
she owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely without inclination for the party
the coles expressed themselves so properlythere was so much real attention in the manner of itso much consideration for her father
they would have solicited the honour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a foldingscreen from london which they hoped might keep mr woodhouse from any draught of air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company upon the whole she was very persuadable and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comforthow certainly mrs goddard if not mrs bates might be depended on for bearing him companymr
woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughters going out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending the whole evening away from him
as for his going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late and the party too numerous
he was soon pretty well resigned
i am not fond of dinnervisiting said hei never was
no more is emma
late hours do not agree with us
i am sorry mr and mrs cole should have done it
i think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer and take their tea with ustake us in their afternoon walk which they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening
the dews of a summer evening are what i would not expose any body to
however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you will both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her i cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought neither damp nor cold nor windy then turning to mrs weston with a look of gentle reproachah
miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me  well sir cried mr weston as i took miss taylor away it is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will step to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it  but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing not lessening mr woodhouses agitation
the ladies knew better how to allay it
mr weston must be quiet and every thing deliberately arranged
with this treatment mr woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual
he should be happy to see mrs goddard
he had a great regard for mrs goddard and emma should write a line and invite her
james could take the note
but first of all there must be an answer written to mrs cole  you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible
you will say that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must decline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments of course
but you will do every thing right
i need not tell you what is to be done
we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday
i shall have no fears for you with him
we have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely
and when you get there you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again and you had better name an early hour
you will not like staying late
you will get very tired when tea is over  but you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa  oh
no my love but you will soon be tired
there will be a great many people talking at once
you will not like the noise  but my dear sir cried mr weston if emma comes away early it will be breaking up the party  and no great harm if it does said mr woodhouse
the sooner every party breaks up the better  but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles
emmas going away directly after tea might be giving offence
they are goodnatured people and think little of their own claims but still they must feel that any bodys hurrying away is no great compliment and miss woodhouses doing it would be more thought of than any other persons in the room
you would not wish to disappoint and mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people as ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years  no upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged to you for reminding me
i should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain
i know what worthy people they are
perry tells me that mr cole never touches malt liquor
you would not think it to look at him but he is biliousmr
cole is very bilious
no i would not be the means of giving them any pain
my dear emma we must consider this
i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish
you will not regard being tired
you will be perfectly safe you know among your friends  oh yes papa
i have no fears at all for myself and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account
i am only afraid of your sitting up for me
i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard
she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your usual timeand the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort
you must promise me not to sit up  he did on the condition of some promises on her side such as that if she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly if hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid should sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house as usual
frank churchill came back again and if he kept his fathers dinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr woodhouse to betray any imperfection which could be concealed
he came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with a very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done
he had no reason to wish his hair longer to conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent to improve his spirits
he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself  i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way
wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not always follyit depends upon the character of those who handle it
mr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man
if he were he would have done this differently
he would either have gloried in the achievement or been ashamed of it
there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanitiesno i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly  with tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again and for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners and by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air and of fancying what the observations of all those might be who were now seeing them together for the first time
she meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at mr coles and without being able to forget that among the failings of mr elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with mr cole
her fathers comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as mrs goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty before she left the house was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all the amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling selfdenial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the mealshe had provided a plentiful dinner for them she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it
she followed another carriage to mr coles door and was pleased to see that it was mr knightleys for mr knightley keeping no horses having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and independence was too apt in emmas opinion to get about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of donwell abbey
she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out
this is coming as you should do said she like a gentlemani am quite glad to see you  he thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same moment
for if we had met first in the drawingroom i doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usualyou might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner  yes i should i am sure i should
there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them
you think you carry it off very well i dare say but with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern i always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances
now you have nothing to try for
you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed
you are not striving to look taller than any body else
now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you  nonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger
emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr knightley
she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for
when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by herand as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side
the party was rather large as it included one other family a proper unobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr coxs family the lawyer of highbury
the less worthy females were to come in the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and mr elton were talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour
the first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax
mrs cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting
she listened and found it well worth listening to
that very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply
mrs cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianofortea very elegant looking instrumentnot a grand but a largesized square pianoforte and the substance of the story the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry and congratulations on her side and explanations on miss batess was that this pianoforte had arrived from broadwoods the day before to the great astonishment of both aunt and nieceentirely unexpected that at first by miss batess account jane herself was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered itbut now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarterof course it must be from colonel campbell
one can suppose nothing else added mrs cole and i was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt
but jane it seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said about it
she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present
they might chuse to surprize her  mrs cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there were enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way and still listen to mrs cole
i declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given me more satisfactionit always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax who plays so delightfully should not have an instrument
it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away
this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure
and it was but yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawingroom while i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself withi was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was boughtor else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of itwe are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening  miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs coles turned to frank churchill
why do you smile said she
nay why do you  mei suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbells being so rich and so liberalit is a handsome present  very  i rather wonder that it was never made before  perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before  or that he did not give her the use of their own instrumentwhich must now be shut up in london untouched by any body  that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs batess house  you may say what you chusebut your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine  i do not know
i rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than i deserve
i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question
if colonel campbell is not the person who can be  what do you say to mrs dixon  mrs
dixon
very true indeed
i had not thought of mrs dixon
she must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument would be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize is more like a young womans scheme than an elderly mans
it is mrs dixon i dare say
i told you that your suspicions would guide mine  if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr
dixon in them  mr
dixonvery well
yes i immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of mr and mrs dixon
we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance  yes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i had entertained beforei do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help suspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend he had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side
one might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland
here she must be leading a life of privation and penance there it would have been all enjoyment
as to the pretence of trying her native air i look upon that as a mere excusein the summer it might have passed but what can any bodys native air do for them in the months of january february and march
good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in hers
i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions though you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly tell you what they are  and upon my word they have an air of great probability
mr dixons preference of her music to her friends i can answer for being very decided  and then he saved her life
did you ever hear of thata water party and by some accident she was falling overboard
he caught her  he did
i was thereone of the party  were you reallywellbut you observed nothing of course for it seems to be a new idea to youif i had been there i think i should have made some discoveries  i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught herit was the work of a moment
and though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durableindeed i believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable againyet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable
i do not mean to say however that you might not have made discoveries  the conversation was here interrupted
they were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored emma said  the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me
i wanted to know a little more and this tells me quite enough
depend upon it we shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon  and if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the campbells  no i am sure it is not from the campbells
miss fairfax knows it is not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first
she would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them
i may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon is a principal in the business  indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced
your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely
at first while i supposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw it only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing in the world
but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship
and now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love  there was no occasion to press the matter farther
the conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it
she said no more other subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away the dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever things said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the othernothing worse than everyday remarks dull repetitions old news and heavy jokes
the ladies had not been long in the drawingroom before the other ladies in their different divisions arrived
emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection
there she satand who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding
to be in company nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour
jane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad to have purchased the mortification of having lovedyes of having loved even mr elton in vainby the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend
in so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her
she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend colonel campbell  mrs weston kindhearted and musical was particularly interested by the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the fair heroines countenance
they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the early was frank churchill
in he walked the first and the handsomest and after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and her niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle where sat miss woodhouse and till he could find a seat by her would not sit at all
emma divined what every body present must be thinking
she was his object and every body must perceive it
she introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other
he had never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her navet and she only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a little like mr elton emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence
smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech
he told her that he had been impatient to leave the diningroomhated sitting longwas always the first to move when he couldthat his father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left very busy over parish businessthat as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogetherthought it so abundant in agreeable familiesthat emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much
she questioned him as to the society in yorkshirethe extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were among a range of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that mrs churchill were not in health and spirits for going that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night
she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked
his importance at enscombe was very evident
he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing
one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned
he had wanted very much to go abroadhad been very eager indeed to be allowed to travelbut she would not hear of it
this had happened the year before
now he said he was beginning to have no longer the same wish
the unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father
i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause i have been here a week tomorrowhalf my time
i never knew days fly so fast
a week tomorrowand i have hardly begun to enjoy myself
but just got acquainted with mrs weston and othersi hate the recollection  perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day out of so few in having your hair cut  no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all
i have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself fit to be seen  the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to mr cole
when mr cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room at miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite
what is the matter said she
he started
thank you for rousing me he replied
i believe i have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair in so odd a wayso very odd a waythat i cannot keep my eyes from her
i never saw any thing so outrethose curlsthis must be a fancy of her own
i see nobody else looking like heri must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion
shall iyes i willi declare i willand you shall see how she takes itwhether she colours  he was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing
before he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs weston
this is the luxury of a large party said sheone can get near every body and say every thing
my dear emma i am longing to talk to you
i have been making discoveries and forming plans just like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh
do you know how miss bates and her niece came here  howthey were invited were not they  oh
yesbut how they were conveyed hitherthe manner of their coming  they walked i conclude
how else could they come  very truewell a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night and cold as the nights are now
and as i looked at her though i never saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she was heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold
poor girl
i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston came into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about the carriage
you may guess how readily he came into my wishes and having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once
good soul
she was as grateful as possible you may be sure
nobody was ever so fortunate as herselfbut with many many thanksthere was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightleys carriage had brought and was to take them home again i was quite surprizedvery glad i am sure but really quite surprized
such a very kind attentionand so thoughtful an attentionthe sort of thing that so few men would think of
and in short from knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all
i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them  very likely said emmanothing more likely
i know no man more likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thingto do any thing really goodnatured useful considerate or benevolent
he is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this considering jane fairfaxs illhealth would appear a case of humanity to himand for an act of unostentatious kindness there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley
i know he had horses todayfor we arrived together and i laughed at him about it but he said not a word that could betray  well said mrs weston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again
the more i think of it the more probable it appears
in short i have made a match between mr knightley and jane fairfax
see the consequence of keeping you companywhat do you say to it  mr
knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma
dear mrs weston how could you think of such a thingmr
knightleymr
knightley must not marryyou would not have little henry cut out from donwelloh
no no henry must have donwell
i cannot at all consent to mr knightleys marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely
i am amazed that you should think of such a thing  my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it
i do not want the matchi do not want to injure dear little henrybut the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley really wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henrys account a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter  yes i would
i could not bear to have henry supplantedmr
knightley marryno i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now
and jane fairfax too of all women  nay she has always been a first favourite with him as you very well know  but the imprudence of such a match  i am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability  i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention
his goodnature his humanity as i tell you would be quite enough to account for the horses
he has a great regard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfaxand is always glad to shew them attention
my dear mrs weston do not take to matchmaking
you do it very ill jane fairfax mistress of the abbeyoh
no noevery feeling revolts
for his own sake i would not have him do so mad a thing  imprudent if you pleasebut not mad
excepting inequality of fortune and perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable  but mr knightley does not want to marry
i am sure he has not the least idea of it
do not put it into his head
why should he marryhe is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep and his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely fond of his brothers children
he has no occasion to marry either to fill up his time or his heart  my dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves jane fairfax  nonsense
he does not care about jane fairfax
in the way of love i am sure he does not
he would do any good to her or her family but  well said mrs weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he could do them would be to give jane such a respectable home  if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion
how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to himto have her haunting the abbey and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying janeso very kind and obligingbut he always had been such a very kind neighbour and then fly off through half a sentence to her mothers old petticoat
not that it was such a very old petticoat eitherfor still it would last a great whileand indeed she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong  for shame emma
do not mimic her
you divert me against my conscience
and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would be much disturbed by miss bates
little things do not irritate him
she might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would only talk louder and drown her voice
but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does
i have heard him speak and so must you so very highly of jane fairfax
the interest he takes in herhis anxiety about her healthhis concern that she should have no happier prospect
i have heard him express himself so warmly on those pointssuch an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte and of her voice
i have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever
oh
and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to methis pianoforte that has been sent here by somebodythough we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the campbells may it not be from mr knightley
i cannot help suspecting him
i think he is just the person to do it even without being in love  then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love
but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do
mr knightley does nothing mysteriously  i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common course of things occur to him  very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so  there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma
i have a very strong notion that it comes from him
i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner  you take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have many a time reproached me with doing
i see no sign of attachmenti believe nothing of the pianoforteand proof only shall convince me that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax  they combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs weston was the most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparationand at the same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it
frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax followed mr cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very proper compliance
she knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany her own voice well
one accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprizea second slightly but correctly taken by frank churchill
her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed
he was accused of having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music which was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter and had no voice at all roundly asserted
they sang together once more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own
with mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument to listen
frank churchill sang again
they had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth
but the sight of mr knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half emmas mind and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs westons suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions
her objections to mr knightleys marrying did not in the least subside
she could see nothing but evil in it
it would be a great disappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella
a real injury to the childrena most mortifying change and material loss to them alla very great deduction from her fathers daily comfortand as to herself she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey
a mrs knightley for them all to give way tonomr
knightley must never marry
little henry must remain the heir of donwell
presently mr knightley looked back and came and sat down by her
they talked at first only of the performance
his admiration was certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs weston it would not have struck her
as a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own
i often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions
it is not that i am without the wish but you know how impossible my father would deem it that james should putto for such a purpose  quite out of the question quite out of the question he repliedbut you must often wish it i am sure and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step
this present from the campbells said shethis pianoforte is very kindly given  yes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassmentbut they would have done better had they given her notice of it
surprizes are foolish things
the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable
i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell  from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument
but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there were no actual preferenceremained a little longer doubtful
towards the end of janes second song her voice grew thick
that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloudyou have sung quite enough for one eveningnow be quiet  another song however was soon begged for
one morethey would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling
the strength of the song falls on the second  mr knightley grew angry
that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice
this must not be and touching miss bates who at that moment passed nearmiss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner
go and interfere
they have no mercy on her  miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing
here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancingoriginating nobody exactly knew wherewas so effectually promoted by mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space
mrs weston capital in her countrydances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top
while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr knightley
this would be a trial
he was no dancer in general
if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something
there was no immediate appearance
no he was talking to mrs colehe was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else and he was still talking to mrs cole
emma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment
not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a partner
they were a couple worth looking at
two dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed
it was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home on her mothers account
after some attempts therefore to be permitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs weston look sorrowful and have done
perhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma to her carriage
i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after yours       emma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles
the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity
she must have delighted the colesworthy people who deserved to be made happyand left a name behind her that would not soon die away
perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy
she doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of jane fairfaxs feelings to frank churchill
it was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue
the other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax and there she had no doubt
she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing
she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhoodand sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half
she was then interrupted by harriets coming in and if harriets praise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted
oh
if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax  dont class us together harriet
my playing is no more like hers than a lamp is like sunshine  oh
deari think you play the best of the two
i think you play quite as well as she does
i am sure i had much rather hear you
every body last night said how well you played  those who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference
the truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised but jane fairfaxs is much beyond it  well i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out
mr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked a great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more than execution  ah
but jane fairfax has them both harriet  are you sure
i saw she had execution but i did not know she had any taste
nobody talked about it
and i hate italian singingthere is no understanding a word of it
besides if she does play so very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach
the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family
how did you think the coxes looked  just as they always dovery vulgar  they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence  emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its producing mr elton
they told methat mr martin dined with them last saturday  oh  he came to their father upon some business and he asked him to stay to dinner  oh  they talked a great deal about him especially anne cox
i do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i should go and stay there again next summer  she meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox should be  she said he was very agreeable the day he dined there
he sat by her at dinner
miss nash thinks either of the coxes would be very glad to marry him  very likelyi think they are without exception the most vulgar girls in highbury  harriet had business at fordsemma thought it most prudent to go with her
another accidental meeting with the martins was possible and in her present state would be dangerous
harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusementmuch could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highburymr
perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting himself in at the officedoor mr coles carriagehorses returning from exercise or a stray letterboy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling children round the bakers little bowwindow eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door
a mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see nothing that does not answer
she looked down the randalls road
the scene enlarged two persons appeared mrs weston and her soninlaw they were walking into highburyto hartfield of course
they were stopping however in the first place at mrs batess whose house was a little nearer randalls than fords and had all but knocked when emma caught their eyeimmediately they crossed the road and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterdays engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting
mrs weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument
for my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised miss bates last night that i would come this morning
i was not aware of it myself
i did not know that i had fixed a day but as he says i did i am going now  and while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope said frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfieldif you are going home  mrs weston was disappointed
i thought you meant to go with me
they would be very much pleased  me
i should be quite in the way
but perhapsi may be equally in the way here
miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me
my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping
she says i fidget her to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same
what am i to do  i am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting for my friend
she will probably have soon done and then we shall go home
but you had better go with mrs weston and hear the instrument  wellif you advise itbut with a smile if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend and if it should prove to have an indifferent tonewhat shall i say
i shall be no support to mrs weston
she might do very well by herself
a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood  i do not believe any such thing replied emmai am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent
quite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfaxs opinion last night  do come with me said mrs weston if it be not very disagreeable to you
it need not detain us long
we will go to hartfield afterwards
we will follow them to hartfield
i really wish you to call with me
it will be felt so great an attention
and i always thought you meant it  he could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him returned with mrs weston to mrs batess door
emma watched them in and then joined harriet at the interesting countertrying with all the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern
at last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel
should i send it to mrs goddards maam asked mrs fordyesnoyes to mrs goddards
only my pattern gown is at hartfield
no you shall send it to hartfield if you please
but then mrs goddard will want to see itand i could take the pattern gown home any day
but i shall want the ribbon directlyso it had better go to hartfieldat least the ribbon
you could make it into two parcels mrs ford could not you  it is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble of two parcels  no more it is  no trouble in the world maam said the obliging mrs ford
oh
but indeed i would much rather have it only in one
then if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddardsi do not knowno i think miss woodhouse i may just as well have it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night
what do you advise  that you do not give another halfsecond to the subject
to hartfield if you please mrs ford  aye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddards  voices approached the shopor rather one voice and two ladies mrs weston and miss bates met them at the door
my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith
how do you do miss smithvery well i thank youand i begged mrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding  i hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are  very well i am much obliged to you
my mother is delightfully well and jane caught no cold last night
how is mr woodhousei am so glad to hear such a good account
mrs weston told me you were hereoh
then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother will be so very happy to see herand now we are such a nice party she cannot refuseaye pray do said mr frank churchill miss woodhouses opinion of the instrument will be worth havingbut said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with meoh said he wait half a minute till i have finished my jobfor would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is in the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my mothers spectaclesthe rivet came out you know this morningso very obligingfor my mother had no use of her spectaclescould not put them on
and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed
jane said so
i meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did but something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing then another there is no saying what you know
at one time patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping
oh said i patty do not come with your bad news to me
here is the rivet of your mistresss spectacles out
then the baked apples came home mrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and obliging to us the wallises alwaysi have heard some people say that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them
and it cannot be for the value of our custom now for what is our consumption of bread you know
only three of usbesides dear jane at presentand she really eats nothingmakes such a shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it
i dare not let my mother know how little she eatsso i say one thing and then i say another and it passes off
but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry i happened to meet him in the street
not that i had any doubt beforei have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple
i believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome
we have appledumplings however very often
patty makes an excellent appledumpling
well mrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will oblige us  emma would be very happy to wait on mrs bates c and they did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than  how do you do mrs ford
i beg your pardon
i did not see you before
i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town
jane came back delighted yesterday
thank ye the gloves do very wellonly a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in  what was i talking of said she beginning again when they were all in the street
emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix
i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking ofoh
my mothers spectacles
so very obliging of mr frank churchill
oh said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job of this kind excessivelywhich you know shewed him to be so very
indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing
i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly
he seems every thing the fondest parent could oh said he i can fasten the rivet
i like a job of that sort excessively i never shall forget his manner
and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good and these are the finestlooking homebaked apples i ever saw in my life that you know was so very and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment
indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justiceonly we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three timesbut miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it
the apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt all from donwellsome of mr knightleys most liberal supply
he sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his treesi believe there is two of them
my mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days
but i was really quite shocked the other dayfor mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock
i am sure you must be said he and i will send you another supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use
william larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year
i will send you some more before they get good for nothing so i begged he would notfor really as to ours being gone i could not absolutely say that we had a great many leftit was but half a dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could not at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he had been already and jane said the same
and when he was gone she almost quarrelled with meno i should not say quarrelled for we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great many left
oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could
however the very same evening william larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same sort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged and went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing as you may suppose
william larkins is such an old acquaintance
i am always glad to see him
but however i found afterwards from patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort his master had he had brought them alland now his master had not one left to bake or boil
william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his masters profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away
she could not bear that her master should not be able to have another appletart this spring
he told patty this but bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us about it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as so many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder
and so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed
i would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for the world
he would be so very
i wanted to keep it from janes knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was aware  miss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to pursued only by the sounds of her desultory goodwill
pray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning
pray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircaserather darker and narrower than one could wish
miss smith pray take care
miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you hit your foot
miss smith the step at the turning       the appearance of the little sittingroom as they entered was tranquillity itself mrs bates deprived of her usual employment slumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte
busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again
this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated
you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed  what said mrs weston have not you finished it yet
you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate  i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe
you see we have been wedging one leg with paper
this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come
i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home  he contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again
that she was not immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again
at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to
mrs weston had been delighted before and was delighted again emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise
whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill
i heard a good deal of colonel campbells taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize
i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself
do not you think so  jane did not look round
she was not obliged to hear
mrs weston had been speaking to her at the same moment
it is not fair said emma in a whisper mine was a random guess
do not distress her  he shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy
soon afterwards he began again  how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion miss fairfax
i dare say they often think of you and wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instruments coming to hand
do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this timedo you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences  he paused
she could not but hear she could not avoid answering  till i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice of forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence
it must be all conjecture  conjectureaye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong
i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall make this rivet quite firm
what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse when hard at work if one talks at allyour real workmen i suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a wordmiss fairfax said something about conjecturing
there it is done
i have the pleasure madam to mrs bates of restoring your spectacles healed for the present  he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more
if you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes we danced last nightlet me live them over again
you did not enjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time
i believe you were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worldsall the worlds one ever has to givefor another halfhour  she played
what felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happyif i mistake not that was danced at weymouth  she looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played something else
he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning to emma said  here is something quite new to me
do you know itcramerand here are a new set of irish melodies
that from such a quarter one might expect
this was all sent with the instrument
very thoughtful of colonel campbell was not ithe knew miss fairfax could have no music here
i honour that part of the attention particularly it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart
nothing hastily done nothing incomplete
true affection only could have prompted it  emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to herthis amiable upright perfect jane fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings
he brought all the music to her and they looked it over togetheremma took the opportunity of whispering  you speak too plain
she must understand you  i hope she does
i would have her understand me
i am not in the least ashamed of my meaning  but really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up the idea  i am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me
i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways
leave shame to her
if she does wrong she ought to feel it  she is not entirely without it i think  i do not see much sign of it
she is playing robin adair at this momenthis favourite  shortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window descried mr knightley on horseback not far off
mr
knightley i declarei must speak to him if possible just to thank him
i will not open the window here it would give you all cold but i can go into my mothers room you know
i dare say he will come in when he knows who is here
quite delightful to have you all meet soour little room so honoured  she was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening the casement there immediately called mr knightleys attention and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others as if it had passed within the same apartment
how d ye dohow dye dovery well i thank you
so obliged to you for the carriage last night
we were just in time my mother just ready for us
pray come in do come in
you will find some friends here  so began miss bates and mr knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say  how is your niece miss batesi want to inquire after you all but particularly your niece
how is miss fairfaxi hope she caught no cold last night
how is she today
tell me how miss fairfax is  and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else
the listeners were amused and mrs weston gave emma a look of particular meaning
but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism
so obliged to youso very much obliged to you for the carriage resumed miss bates
he cut her short with  i am going to kingston
can i do any thing for you  oh
dear kingstonare youmrs
cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston  mrs
cole has servants to send
can i do any thing for you  no i thank you
but do come in
who do you think is heremiss woodhouse and miss smith so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte
do put up your horse at the crown and come in  well said he in a deliberating manner for five minutes perhaps  and here is mrs weston and mr frank churchill tooquite delightful so many friends  no not now i thank you
i could not stay two minutes
i must get on to kingston as fast as i can  oh
do come in
they will be so very happy to see you  no no your room is full enough
i will call another day and hear the pianoforte  well i am so sorryoh
mr knightley what a delightful party last night how extremely pleasantdid you ever see such dancingwas not it delightfulmiss woodhouse and mr frank churchill i never saw any thing equal to it  oh
very delightful indeed i can say nothing less for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes
and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too
i think miss fairfax dances very well and mrs weston is the very best countrydance player without exception in england
now if your friends have any gratitude they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return but i cannot stay to hear it  oh
mr knightley one moment more something of consequenceso shockedjane and i are both so shocked about the apples  what is the matter now  to think of your sending us all your store apples
you said you had a great many and now you have not one left
we really are so shocked
mrs hodges may well be angry
william larkins mentioned it here
you should not have done it indeed you should not
ah
he is off
he never can bear to be thanked
but i thought he would have staid now and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned well returning to the room i have not been able to succeed
mr knightley cannot stop
he is going to kingston
he asked me if he could do any thing  yes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing  oh
yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud
you must have heard every thing to be sure
can i do any thing for you at kingston said he so i just mentioned oh
miss woodhouse must you be goingyou seem but just comeso very obliging of you  emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that mrs weston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls
it may be possible to do without dancing entirely
instances have been known of young people passing many many months successively without being at any ball of any description and no material injury accrue either to body or mindbut when a beginning is madewhen the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly feltit must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more
frank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again and the last halfhour of an evening which mr woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject
franks was the first idea and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance
but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse dancedfor doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfaxand even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanityto assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to holdand then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest
his first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr coles should be finished therethat the same party should be collected and the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence
mr weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment and mrs weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed of reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple
you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five had been repeated many times over
and there will be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself besides mr knightley
yes that will be quite enough for pleasure
you and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room  but soon it came to be on one side  but will there be good room for five couplei really do not think there will  on another  and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up
five couple are nothing when one thinks seriously about it
it will not do to invite five couple
it can be allowable only as the thought of the moment  somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brothers and must be invited with the rest
somebody else believed mrs
gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had been asked
a word was put in for a second young cox and at last mr weston naming one family of cousins who must be included and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of
the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other
might not they use both rooms and dance across the passage it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better
emma said it would be awkward mrs weston was in distress about the supper and mr woodhouse opposed it earnestly on the score of health
it made him so very unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in
oh
no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence
i could not bear it for emmaemma is not strong
she would catch a dreadful cold
so would poor little harriet
so you would all
mrs weston you would be quite laid up do not let them talk of such a wild thing
pray do not let them talk of it
that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless
do not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing
he has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping them open very inconsiderately
he does not think of the draught
i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing  mrs weston was sorry for such a charge
she knew the importance of it and said every thing in her power to do it away
every door was now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again and with such goodwill on frank churchills part that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten
we were too magnificent said he
we allowed unnecessary room
ten couple may stand here very well  emma demurred
it would be a crowda sad crowd and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in  very true he gravely replied it was very bad but still he went on measuring and still he ended with  i think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple  no no said she you are quite unreasonable
it would be dreadful to be standing so close
nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowdand a crowd in a little room  there is no denying it he replied
i agree with you exactly
a crowd in a little roommiss woodhouse you have the art of giving pictures in a few words
exquisite quite exquisitestill however having proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up
it would be a disappointment to my fatherand altogetheri do not know thati am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well  emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little selfwilled and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest
had she intended ever to marry him it might have been worth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value of his preference and the character of his temper but for all the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough
before the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme
it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement
well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my fathers little rooms
i bring a new proposal on the subjecta thought of my fathers which waits only your approbation to be acted upon
may i hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball to be given not at randalls but at the crown inn  the crown  yes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there
better accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful welcome than at randalls
it is his own idea
mrs weston sees no objection to it provided you are satisfied
this is what we all feel
oh
you were perfectly right
ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferabledreadfuli felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield
is not it a good exchangeyou consenti hope you consent  it appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and mrs weston do not
i think it admirable and as far as i can answer for myself shall be most happyit seems the only improvement that could be
papa do you not think it an excellent improvement  she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully comprehended and then being quite new farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable
no he thought it very far from an improvementa very bad planmuch worse than the other
a room at an inn was always damp and dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited
if they must dance they had better dance at randalls
he had never been in the room at the crown in his lifedid not know the people who kept it by sightoh
noa very bad plan
they would catch worse colds at the crown than anywhere  i was going to observe sir said frank churchill that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any bodys catching coldso much less danger at the crown than at randalls
mr perry might have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could  sir said mr woodhouse rather warmly you are very much mistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character
mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill
but i do not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you than your fathers house  from the very circumstance of its being larger sir
we shall have no occasion to open the windows at allnot once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief  open the windowsbut surely mr churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls
nobody could be so imprudent
i never heard of such a thing
dancing with open windowsi am sure neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it  ah
sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a windowcurtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected
i have often known it done myself  have you indeed sirbless me
i never could have supposed it
but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear
however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it overbut these sort of things require a good deal of consideration
one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry
if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done  but unfortunately sir my time is so limited  oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over
there is no hurry at all
if it can be contrived to be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses
they will be so near their own stable  so they will my dear
that is a great thing
not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can
if i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly airedbut is mrs stokes to be trusted
i doubt it
i do not know her even by sight  i can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will be under mrs westons care
mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole  there papanow you must be satisfiedour own dear mrs weston who is carefulness itself
do not you remember what mr perry said so many years ago when i had the measles
if miss taylor undertakes to wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her  aye very true
mr perry did say so
i shall never forget it
poor little emma
you were very bad with the measles that is you would have been very bad but for perrys great attention
he came four times a day for a week
he said from the first it was a very good sortwhich was our great comfort but the measles are a dreadful complaint
i hope whenever poor isabellas little ones have the measles she will send for perry  my father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment said frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house
i left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot
i was desired to say so from both
it would be the greatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there
they can do nothing satisfactorily without you  emma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father engaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young people set off together without delay for the crown
there were mr and mrs weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation very busy and very happy in their different way she in some little distress and he finding every thing perfect
emma said she this paper is worse than i expected
look
in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined  my dear you are too particular said her husband
what does all that signify
you will see nothing of it by candlelight
it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight
we never see any thing of it on our clubnights  the ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never know when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares  one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain
it regarded a supperroom
at the time of the ballrooms being built suppers had not been in question and a small cardroom adjoining was the only addition
what was to be done
this cardroom would be wanted as a cardroom now or if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for any comfortable supper
another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it
this made a difficulty
mrs weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper
mrs weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches c set out in the little room but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion
a private dance without sitting down to supper was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women and mrs weston must not speak of it again
she then took another line of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed  i do not think it is so very small
we shall not be many you know  and mr weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps through the passage was calling out  you talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear
it is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from the stairs  i wish said mrs weston one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best
to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our objectif one could but tell what that would be  yes very true cried frank very true
you want your neighbours opinions
i do not wonder at you
if one could ascertain what the chief of themthe coles for instance
they are not far off
shall i call upon them
or miss bates
she is still nearerand i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body
i think we do want a larger council
suppose i go and invite miss bates to join us  wellif you please said mrs weston rather hesitating if you think she will be of any use  you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma
she will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing
she will not even listen to your questions
i see no advantage in consulting miss bates  but she is so amusing so extremely amusing
i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk
and i need not bring the whole family you know  here mr weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation
aye do frankgo and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter at once
she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties
fetch miss bates
we are growing a little too nice
she is a standing lesson of how to be happy
but fetch them both
invite them both  both sir
can the old lady  the old lady
no the young lady to be sure
i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece  oh
i beg your pardon sir
i did not immediately recollect
undoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both and away he ran
long before he reappeared attending the short neat briskmoving aunt and her elegant niecemrs
weston like a sweettempered woman and a good wife had examined the passage again and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed beforeindeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision
all the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth
all the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music tea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs weston and mrs stokesevery body invited was certainly to come frank had already written to enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight which could not possibly be refused
and a delightful dance it was to be
most cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must
as a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much safer character she was truly welcome
her approbation at once general and minute warm and incessant could not but please and for another halfhour they were all walking to and fro between the different rooms some suggesting some attending and all in happy enjoyment of the future
the party did not break up without emmas being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr weston whisper to his wife he has asked her my dear
thats right
i knew he would       one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emmaits being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchills stay in surry for in spite of mr westons confidence she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight
but this was not judged feasible
the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertaintyat the riskin her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain
enscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word
his wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was not opposed
all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain of her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr knightleys provoking indifference about it
either because he did not dance himself or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him determined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording him any future amusement
to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply than  very well
if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing to say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for meoh
yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep as much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over william larkinss weeks account much rather i confesspleasure in seeing dancingnot i indeedi never look at iti do not know who doesfine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward
those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different  this emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry
it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree
it made her animatedopen heartedshe voluntarily said  oh
miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball
what a disappointment it would be
i do look forward to it i own with very great pleasure  it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins
noshe was more and more convinced that mrs weston was quite mistaken in that surmise
there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his sidebut no love
alas
there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley
two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the overthrow of every thing
a letter arrived from mr churchill to urge his nephews instant return
mrs churchill was unwellfar too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay
the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from mrs weston instantly
as to his going it was inevitable
he must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance
he knew her illnesses they never occurred but for her own convenience
mrs weston added that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon  this wretched note was the finale of emmas breakfast
when once it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim
the loss of the ballthe loss of the young manand all that the young man might be feelingit was too wretchedsuch a delightful evening as it would have beenevery body so happy
and she and her partner the happiesti said it would be so was the only consolation
her fathers feelings were quite distinct
he thought principally of mrs churchills illness and wanted to know how she was treated and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed but they would all be safer at home
emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared but if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him
he felt the going away almost too much to speak of it
his dejection was most evident
he sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say  of all horrid things leavetaking is the worst  but you will come again said emma
this will not be your only visit to randalls  ahshaking his headthe uncertainty of when i may be able to returni shall try for it with a zealit will be the object of all my thoughts and caresand if my uncle and aunt go to town this springbut i am afraidthey did not stir last springi am afraid it is a custom gone for ever  our poor ball must be quite given up  ah
that ballwhy did we wait for any thingwhy not seize the pleasure at oncehow often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparationyou told us it would be sooh
miss woodhouse why are you always so right  indeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance
i would much rather have been merry than wise  if i can come again we are still to have our ball
my father depends on it
do not forget your engagement  emma looked graciously
such a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more precious and more delightful than the day beforeevery day making me less fit to bear any other place
happy those who can remain at highbury  as you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will venture to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first
do not we rather surpass your expectations
i am sure we do
i am sure you did not much expect to like us
you would not have been so long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury  he laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment emma was convinced that it had been so
and you must be off this very morning  yes my father is to join me here we shall walk back together and i must be off immediately
i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him  not five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and miss bates
how unlucky
miss batess powerful argumentative mind might have strengthened yours  yesi have called there passing the door i thought it better
it was a right thing to do
i went in for three minutes and was detained by miss batess being absent
she was out and i felt it impossible not to wait till she came in
she is a woman that one may that one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight
it was better to pay my visit then  he hesitated got up walked to a window
in short said he perhaps miss woodhousei think you can hardly be quite without suspicion  he looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts
she hardly knew what to say
it seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious which she did not wish
forcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said  you are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then  he was silent
she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting on what she had said and trying to understand the manner
she heard him sigh
it was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh
he could not believe her to be encouraging him
a few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more determined manner said  it was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to hartfield
my regard for hartfield is most warm  he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassedhe was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance
mr woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made him composed
a very few minutes more however completed the present trial
mr weston always alert when business was to be done and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable as of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go and the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree to take leave
i shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation
i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you
i have engaged mrs weston to correspond with me
she has been so kind as to promise it
oh
the blessing of a female correspondent when one is really interested in the absentshe will tell me every thing
in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again  a very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest goodbye closed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill
short had been the noticeshort their meeting he was gone and emma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much
it was a sad change
they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival
certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeksindescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners
it had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of hartfield days
to complete every other recommendation he had almost told her that he loved her
what strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to was another point but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself and this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that she must be a little in love with him in spite of every previous determination against it
i certainly must said she
this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every things being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were notfor a few weeks at least
well
evil to some is always good to others
i shall have many fellowmourners for the ball if not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy
he may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes  mr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness
he could not say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with considerable kindness added  you emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really out of luck you are very much out of luck  it was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet her composure was odious
she had been particularly unwell however suffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare that had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have attended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of illhealth
emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love
her ideas only varied as to the how much
at first she thought it was a good deal and afterwards but little
she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr and mrs weston she was very often thinking of him and quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was how were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring
but on the other hand she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she refused him
their affection was always to subside into friendship
every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting but still they were to part
when she became sensible of this it struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father never to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings
i do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said shein not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives is there any allusion to making a sacrifice
i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness
so much the better
i certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do
i am quite enough in love
i should be sorry to be more  upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings
he is undoubtedly very much in loveevery thing denotes itvery much in love indeedand when he comes again if his affection continue i must be on my guard not to encourage itit would be most inexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up
not that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto
no if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would not have been so wretched
could he have thought himself encouraged his looks and language at parting would have been differentstill however i must be on my guard
this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of mani do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancyhis feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeableevery consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involvedi shall do very well again after a little whileand then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily  when his letter to mrs weston arrived emma had the perusal of it and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she had undervalued their strength
it was a long wellwritten letter giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings expressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was natural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision
no suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the language of real feeling towards mrs weston and the transition from highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of proprietythe charm of her own name was not wanting
miss woodhouse appeared more than once and never without a something of pleasing connexion either a compliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said and in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed
compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these wordsi had not a spare moment on tuesday as you know for miss woodhouses beautiful little friend
pray make my excuses and adieus to her this emma could not doubt was all for herself
harriet was remembered only from being her friend
his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated mrs churchill was recovering and he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for coming to randalls again
gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to mrs weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her
her intentions were unchanged
her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness
his recollection of harriet and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the idea of harriets succeeding her in his affections
was it impossiblenoharriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favourfor harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed
i must not dwell upon it said shei must not think of it
i know the danger of indulging such speculations
but stranger things have happened and when we cease to care for each other as we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward to with pleasure  it was well to have a comfort in store on harriets behalf though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil in that quarter was at hand
as frank churchills arrival had succeeded mr eltons engagement in the conversation of highbury as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now upon frank churchills disappearance mr eltons concerns were assuming the most irresistible formhis weddingday was named
he would soon be among them again mr elton and his bride
there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before mr
elton and his bride was in every bodys mouth and frank churchill was forgotten
emma grew sick at the sound
she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr elton and harriets mind she had been willing to hope had been lately gaining strength
with mr westons ball in view at least there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approachnew carriage bellringing and all
poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give
emma felt that she could not do too much for her that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions the same
harriet listened submissively and said it was very trueit was just as miss woodhouse describedit was not worth while to think about themand she would not think about them any longer but no change of subject could avail and the next halfhour saw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before
at last emma attacked her on another ground
your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about mr eltons marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me
you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into
it was all my doing i know
i have not forgotten it i assure youdeceived myself i did very miserably deceive youand it will be a painful reflection to me for ever
do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it  harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation
emma continued  i have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less talk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather i would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important than my comfort a habit of selfcommand in you a consideration of what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit and restore your tranquillity
these are the motives which i have been pressing on you
they are very importantand sorry i am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them
my being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration
i want you to save yourself from greater pain
perhaps i may sometimes have felt that harriet would not forget what was dueor rather what would be kind by me  this appeal to her affections did more than all the rest
the idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse whom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while and when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably
you who have been the best friend i ever had in my lifewant gratitude to younobody is equal to youi care for nobody as i do for youoh
miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been  such expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before
there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to herself
there is nothing to be compared to it
warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction i am sure it will
it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally belovedwhich gives isabella all her popularityi have it notbut i know how to prize and respect itharriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives
dear harrieti would not change you for the clearestheaded longestsighted bestjudging female breathing
oh
the coldness of a jane fairfaxharriet is worth a hundred suchand for a wifea sensible mans wifeit is invaluable
i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet       mrs elton was first seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid to settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty or not pretty at all
emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of harriets going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible
she could not enter the house again could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago to lace up her boot without recollecting
a thousand vexatious thoughts would recur
compliments charades and horrible blunders and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent
the visit was of course short and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothingmeaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing  she did not really like her
she would not be in a hurry to find fault but she suspected that there was no eleganceease but not elegance she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there was too much ease
her person was rather good her face not unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner were elegant
emma thought at least it would turn out so
as for mr elton his manners did not appearbut no she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners
it was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it
the woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes and the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own good sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor mr elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry and the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly and as little really easy as could be
well miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted the house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin well miss woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of heris not she very charming  there was a little hesitation in emmas answer
oh
yesverya very pleasing young woman  i think her beautiful quite beautiful  very nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown  i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love  oh
nothere is nothing to surprize one at alla pretty fortune and she came in his way  i dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she was very much attached to him  perhaps she might but it is not every mans fate to marry the woman who loves him best
miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have  yes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever have a better
well i wish them happy with all my heart
and now miss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again
he is just as superior as everbut being married you know it is quite a different thing
no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery
to know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfortshe does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves
happy creature
he called her augusta how delightful  when the visit was returned emma made up her mind
she could then see more and judge better
from harriets happening not to be at hartfield and her fathers being present to engage mr elton she had a quarter of an hour of the ladys conversation to herself and could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that mrs elton was a vain woman extremely well satisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance that she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which had been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her notions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living that if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would certainly do mr elton no good
harriet would have been a better match
if not wise or refined herself she would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best of her own set
the rich brotherinlaw near bristol was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him
the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother mr sucklings seata comparison of hartfield to maple grove
the grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the house was modern and wellbuilt
mrs elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she could see or imagine
very like maple grove indeedshe was quite struck by the likenessthat room was the very shape and size of the morningroom at maple grove her sisters favourite roommr
elton was appealed towas not it astonishingly likeshe could really almost fancy herself at maple grove  and the staircaseyou know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house
i really could not help exclaiming
i assure you miss woodhouse it is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so extremely partial to as maple grove
i have spent so many happy months there
with a little sigh of sentiment
a charming place undoubtedly
every body who sees it is struck by its beauty but to me it has been quite a home
whenever you are transplanted like me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind
i always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony  emma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient for mrs elton who only wanted to be talking herself
so extremely like maple grove
and it is not merely the housethe grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly like
the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here and stand very much in the same wayjust across the lawn and i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it which put me so exactly in mind
my brother and sister will be enchanted with this place
people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style  emma doubted the truth of this sentiment
she had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth while to attack an error so doubledyed and therefore only said in reply  when you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield
surry is full of beauties  oh
yes i am quite aware of that
it is the garden of england you know
surry is the garden of england  yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction
many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry  no i fancy not replied mrs elton with a most satisfied smile
i never heard any county but surry called so  emma was silenced
my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest continued mrs elton and that will be our time for exploring
while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say
they will have their barouchelandau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well
they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year
indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouchelandau it will be so very much preferable
when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond of exploring
we explored to kingsweston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouchelandau
you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer  no not immediately here
we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure  ah
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort
nobody can be more devoted to home than i am
i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove
many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl to move from the house
i absolutely must go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the barouchelandau without a companion but augusta i believe with her own goodwill would never stir beyond the park paling many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion
i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little
i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouselooking towards mr woodhouse your fathers state of health must be a great drawback
why does not he try bathindeed he should
let me recommend bath to you
i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr woodhouse good  my father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving any benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown to you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now  ah
thats a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse where the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief they give
in my bath life i have seen such instances of it
and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhouses spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed
and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i need not take much pains to dwell on them
the advantages of bath to the young are pretty generally understood
it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place
a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions and would be the very person for you to go into public with  it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite
the idea of her being indebted to mrs elton for what was called an introductionof her going into public under the auspices of a friend of mrs eltonsprobably some vulgar dashing widow who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to livethe dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed
she restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could have given and only thanked mrs elton coolly but their going to bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father and then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the subject directly
i do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton
upon these occasions a ladys character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer  oh
no indeed i must protest against any such idea
a superior performervery far from it i assure you
consider from how partial a quarter your information came
i am doatingly fond of musicpassionately fondand my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree
you miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully
i assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me to hear what a musical society i am got into
i absolutely cannot do without music
it is a necessary of life to me and having always been used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath it would have been a most serious sacrifice
i honestly said as much to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house tooknowing what i had been accustomed toof course he was not wholly without apprehension
when he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the world i could give upparties balls playsfor i had no fear of retirement
blessed with so many resources within myself the world was not necessary to me
i could do very well without it
to those who had no resources it was a different thing but my resources made me quite independent
and as to smallersized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought
i hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description
certainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness nor were spacious apartments
but said i to be quite honest i do not think i can live without something of a musical society
i condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank to me  we cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive  no indeed i have no doubts at all on that head
i am delighted to find myself in such a circle
i hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together
i think miss woodhouse you and i must establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings at your house or ours
will not it be a good plan
if we exert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies
something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me as an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you knowthere is a sad story against them in general
they are but too apt to give up music  but you who are so extremely fond of itthere can be no danger surely  i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble
selina has entirely given up musicnever touches the instrumentthough she played sweetly
and the same may be said of mrs jeffereysclara partridge that wasand of the two milmans now mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate
upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright
i used to be quite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention
i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper  but every thing of that kind said emma will soon be in so regular a train  well said mrs elton laughing we shall see  emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moments pause mrs elton chose another subject
we have been calling at randalls said she and found them both at home and very pleasant people they seem to be
i like them extremely
mr weston seems an excellent creaturequite a firstrate favourite with me already i assure you
and she appears so truly goodthere is something so motherly and kindhearted about her that it wins upon one directly
she was your governess i think  emma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on
having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very ladylike
but she is really quite the gentlewoman  mrs
westons manners said emma were always particularly good
their propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest model for any young woman  and who do you think came in while we were there  emma was quite at a loss
the tone implied some old acquaintanceand how could she possibly guess
knightley continued mrs elton knightley himselfwas not it luckyfor not being within when he called the other day i had never seen him before and of course as so particular a friend of mr es i had a great curiosity
my friend knightley had been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him and i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend
knightley is quite the gentleman
i like him very much
decidedly i think a very gentlemanlike man  happily it was now time to be gone
they were off and emma could breathe
insufferable woman was her immediate exclamation
worse than i had supposed
absolutely insufferable
knightleyi could not have believed it
knightleynever seen him in her life before and call him knightleyand discover that he is a gentleman
a little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her caro sposo and her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery
actually to discover that mr knightley is a gentleman
i doubt whether he will return the compliment and discover her to be a lady
i could not have believed it
and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club
one would fancy we were bosom friends
and mrs westonastonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman
worse and worse
i never met with her equal
much beyond my hopes
harriet is disgraced by any comparison
oh
what would frank churchill say to her if he were here
how angry and how diverted he would be
ah
there i amthinking of him directly
always the first person to be thought of
how i catch myself out
frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind  all this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time her father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons departure and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable of attending
well my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw her before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say she was very much pleased with you
she speaks a little too quick
a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear
but i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks like you and poor miss taylor
however she seems a very obliging prettybehaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife
though i think he had better not have married
i made the best excuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton on this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course of the summer
but i ought to have gone before
not to wait upon a bride is very remiss
ah
it shews what a sad invalid i am
but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane  i dare say your apologies were accepted sir
mr elton knows you  yes but a young ladya bridei ought to have paid my respects to her if possible
it was being very deficient  but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride
it ought to be no recommendation to you
it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them  no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a ladyand a bride especially is never to be neglected
more is avowedly due to her
a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may  well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is
and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanitybaits for poor young ladies  my dear you do not understand me
this is a matter of mere common politeness and goodbreeding and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry  emma had done
her father was growing nervous and could not understand her
her mind returned to mrs eltons offences and long very long did they occupy her
emma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill opinion of mrs elton
her observation had been pretty correct
such as mrs elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met againselfimportant presuming familiar ignorant and illbred
she had a little beauty and a little accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as mrs eltons consequence only could surpass
there was no reason to suppose mr elton thought at all differently from his wife
he seemed not merely happy with her but proud
he had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal and the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend or not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss batess goodwill or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied so that mrs eltons praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very pleasant and very elegantly dressed  in one respect mrs elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first
her feelings altered towards emmaoffended probably by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant and though the effect was agreeable the illwill which produced it was necessarily increasing emmas dislike
her manners tooand mr eltons were unpleasant towards harriet
they were sneering and negligent
emma hoped it must rapidly work harriets cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very muchit was not to be doubted that poor harriets attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve and her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been given also
she was of course the object of their joint dislikewhen they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet
mrs elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and from the first
not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admirationbut without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting to assist and befriend herbefore emma had forfeited her confidence and about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs eltons knighterrantry on the subject  jane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhousei quite rave about jane fairfaxa sweet interesting creature
so mild and ladylikeand with such talentsi assure you i think she has very extraordinary talents
i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well
i know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point
oh
she is absolutely charming
you will laugh at my warmthbut upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfaxand her situation is so calculated to affect onemiss woodhouse we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her
we must bring her forward
such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknowni dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet  full many a flower is born to blush unseen     and waste its fragrance on the desert air   we must not allow them to be verified in sweet jane fairfax  i cannot think there is any danger of it was emmas calm answerand when you are better acquainted with miss fairfaxs situation and understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell i have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown  oh
but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement such obscurity so thrown awaywhatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end
and i think she feels it
i am sure she does
she is very timid and silent
one can see that she feels the want of encouragement
i like her the better for it
i must confess it is a recommendation to me
i am a great advocate for timidityand i am sure one does not often meet with itbut in those who are at all inferior it is extremely prepossessing
oh
i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express  you appear to feel a great dealbut i am not aware how you or any of miss fairfaxs acquaintance here any of those who have known her longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than  my dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act
you and i need not be afraid
if we set the example many will follow it as far as they can though all have not our situations
we have carriages to fetch and convey her home and we live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenienti should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax to partake of it
i have no idea of that sort of thing
it is not likely that i should considering what i have been used to
my greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the other way in doing too much and being too careless of expense
maple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to befor we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling in incomehowever my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfaxi shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation
my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortlyi shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us
i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets a little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliatingi shall have her very often indeed while they are with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouchelandau in some of our exploring parties  poor jane fairfaxthought emmayou have not deserved this
you may have done wrong with regard to mr dixon but this is a punishment beyond what you can have meritedthe kindness and protection of mrs eltonjane fairfax and jane fairfax heavens
let me not suppose that she dares go about emma woodhouseing mebut upon my honour there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that womans tongue  emma had not to listen to such paradings againto any so exclusively addressed to herselfso disgustingly decorated with a dear miss woodhouse the change on mrs eltons side soon afterwards appeared and she was left in peaceneither forced to be the very particular friend of mrs elton nor under mrs eltons guidance the very active patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others in a general way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done
she looked on with some amusementmiss batess gratitude for mrs eltons attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth
she was quite one of her worthiesthe most amiable affable delightful womanjust as accomplished and condescending as mrs elton meant to be considered
emmas only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate mrs elton as she seemed to do
she heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons spending a day with the eltons
this was astonishingshe could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer
she is a riddle quite a riddle said sheto chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort
and now to chuse the mortification of mrs eltons notice and the penury of her conversation rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real generous affection  jane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells were gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there
according to miss batesit all came from hermrs
dixon had written most pressingly
would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends contrivedno travelling difficulty allowed to exist but still she had declined it
she must have some motive more powerful than appears for refusing this invitation was emmas conclusion
she must be under some sort of penance inflicted either by the campbells or herself
there is great fear great caution great resolution somewhereshe is not to be with the dixons
the decree is issued by somebody
but why must she consent to be with the eltonshere is quite a separate puzzle  upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject before the few who knew her opinion of mrs elton mrs weston ventured this apology for jane
we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emmabut it is better than being always at home
her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome
we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to  you are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton
could she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have chosen her
but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her  emma felt that mrs weston was giving her a momentary glance and she was herself struck by his warmth
with a faint blush she presently replied  such attentions as mrs eltons i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax
mrs eltons invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting  i should not wonder said mrs weston if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunts eagerness in accepting mrs eltons civilities for her
poor miss bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated in spite of the very natural wish of a little change  both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few minutes silence he said  another thing must be taken into consideration toomrs
elton does not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her
we all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest spoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each othera something more early implanted
we cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before
we feel things differently
and besides the operation of this as a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to
such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs eltons way beforeand no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness  i know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma
little henry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say
yes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her  and yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look but soon stoppingit was better however to know the worst at onceshe hurried onand yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is
the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other  mr knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together or some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered  oh
are you therebut you are miserably behindhand
mr cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago  he stoppedemma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston and did not herself know what to think
in a moment he went on  that will never be however i can assure you
miss fairfax i dare say would not have me if i were to ask herand i am very sure i shall never ask her  emma returned her friends pressure with interest and was pleased enough to exclaim  you are not vain mr knightley
i will say that for you  he seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtfuland in a manner which shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said  so you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax  no indeed i have not
you have scolded me too much for matchmaking for me to presume to take such a liberty with you
what i said just now meant nothing
one says those sort of things of course without any idea of a serious meaning
oh
no upon my word i have not the smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body
you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married  mr knightley was thoughtful again
the result of his reverie was no emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprizei never had a thought of her in that way i assure you and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming young womanbut not even jane fairfax is perfect
she has a fault
she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife  emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault
well said she and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose  yes very soon
he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken he asked my pardon and said no more
cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours  in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world
i wonder how she speaks of the coleswhat she calls them
how can she find any appellation for them deep enough in familiar vulgarity
she calls you knightleywhat can she do for mr cole
and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her
mrs weston your argument weighs most with me
i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfaxs mind over mrs elton
i have no faith in mrs eltons acknowledging herself the inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of goodbreeding
i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouchelandau  jane fairfax has feeling said mr knightleyi do not accuse her of want of feeling
her sensibilities i suspect are strongand her temper excellent in its power of forbearance patience selfcontrol but it wants openness
she is reserved more reserved i think than she used to beand i love an open temper
notill cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head
i saw jane fairfax and conversed with her with admiration and pleasure alwaysbut with no thought beyond  well mrs weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to mr knightleys marrying jane fairfax  why really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last
do not beat me       every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage
dinnerparties and eveningparties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day
i see how it is said she
i see what a life i am to lead among you
upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated
we really seem quite the fashion
if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable
from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a disengaged daya woman with fewer resources than i have need not have been at a loss  no invitation came amiss to her
her bath habits made eveningparties perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners
she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at the poor attempt at routcakes and there being no ice in the highbury cardparties
mrs bates mrs perry mrs goddard and others were a good deal behindhand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged
in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior partyin which her cardtables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true styleand more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order
emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the eltons
they must not do less than others or she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable of pitiful resentment
a dinner there must be
after emma had talked about it for ten minutes mr woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him
the persons to be invited required little thought
besides the eltons it must be the westons and mr knightley so far it was all of courseand it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighthbut this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriets begging to be allowed to decline it
she would rather not be in his company more than she could help
she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable
if miss woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home it was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it possible enough for wishing
she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friendfor fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax since her last conversation with mrs weston and mr knightley she was more consciencestricken about jane fairfax than she had often beenmr
knightleys words dwelt with her
he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs elton which nobody else paid her
this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meantand it is very shamefulof the same ageand always knowing heri ought to have been more her friendshe will never like me now
i have neglected her too long
but i will shew her greater attention than i have done  every invitation was successful
they were all disengaged and all happythe preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over
a circumstance rather unlucky occurred
the two eldest little knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them and staying one whole day at hartfieldwhich one day would be the very day of this partyhis professional engagements did not allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so
mr woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bearand here would be a ninthand emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to hartfield for fortyeight hours without falling in with a dinnerparty
she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself by representing that though he certainly would make them nine yet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be very immaterial
she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother
the event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma
john knightley came but mr weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day
he might be able to join them in the evening but certainly not to dinner
mr woodhouse was quite at ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate removed the chief of even emmas vexation
the day came the party were punctually assembled and mr john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable
instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax
mrs elton as elegant as lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silencewanting only to observe enough for isabellas informationbut miss fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could talk to her
he had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning to rain
it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject and he said  i hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i am sure you must have been wetwe scarcely got home in time
i hope you turned directly  i went only to the postoffice said she and reached home before the rain was much
it is my daily errand
i always fetch the letters when i am here
it saves trouble and is a something to get me out
a walk before breakfast does me good  not a walk in the rain i should imagine  no but it did not absolutely rain when i set out  mr john knightley smiled and replied  that is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before
the postoffice has a great charm at one period of our lives
when you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for  there was a little blush and then this answer  i must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters  indifferent
oh
noi never conceived you could become indifferent
letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse  you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship  i have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly
business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does  ah
you are not serious now
i know mr john knightley too welli am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body
i can easily believe that letters are very little to you much less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference it is not age but situation
you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a postoffice i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than today  when i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years said john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings
i consider one as including the other
time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circlebut that is not the change i had in view for you
as an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have  it was kindly said and very far from giving offence
a pleasant thank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip a tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh
her attention was now claimed by mr woodhouse who being according to his custom on such occasions making the circle of his guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies was ending with herand with all his mildest urbanity said  i am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this morning in the rain
young ladies should take care of themselvesyoung ladies are delicate plants
they should take care of their health and their complexion
my dear did you change your stockings  yes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me  my dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared fori hope your good grandmama and aunt are well
they are some of my very old friends
i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour
you do us a great deal of honour today i am sure
my daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield  the kindhearted polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy
by this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs elton and her remonstrances now opened upon jane
my dear jane what is this i heargoing to the postoffice in the rainthis must not be i assure youyou sad girl how could you do such a thingit is a sign i was not there to take care of you  jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold
oh
do not tell me
you really are a very sad girl and do not know how to take care of yourselfto the postoffice indeed
mrs weston did you ever hear the like
you and i must positively exert our authority  my advice said mrs weston kindly and persuasively i certainly do feel tempted to give
miss fairfax you must not run such risksliable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought to be particularly careful especially at this time of year
the spring i always think requires more than common care
better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again
now do not you feel that you had
yes i am sure you are much too reasonable
you look as if you would not do such a thing again  oh
she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined mrs elton
we will not allow her to do such a thing againand nodding significantlythere must be some arrangement made there must indeed
i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches our letters every morning one of our men i forget his name shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you
that will obviate all difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation  you are extremely kind said jane but i cannot give up my early walk
i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the postoffice is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before  my dear jane say no more about it
the thing is determined that is laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master
you know mrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves
but i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely worn out
if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled  excuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant
if the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it always is when i am not here by my grandmamas  oh
my dear but so much as patty has to doand it is a kindness to employ our men  jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead of answering she began speaking again to mr john knightley
the postoffice is a wonderful establishment said shethe regularity and despatch of it
if one thinks of all that it has to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing  it is certainly very well regulated  so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears
so seldom that a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom is even carried wrongand not one in a million i suppose actually lost
and when one considers the variety of hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered it increases the wonder  the clerks grow expert from habitthey must begin with some quickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them
if you want any farther explanation continued he smiling they are paid for it
that is the key to a great deal of capacity
the public pays and must be served well  the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual observations made
i have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the same master teaches it is natural enough
but for that reason i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females for boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble into any hand they can get
isabella and emma i think do write very much alike
i have not always known their writing apart  yes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness
i know what you meanbut emmas hand is the strongest  isabella and emma both write beautifully said mr woodhouse and always did
and so does poor mrs westonwith half a sigh and half a smile at her
i never saw any gentlemans handwritingemma began looking also at mrs weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs weston was attending to some one elseand the pause gave her time to reflect now how am i going to introduce himam i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people
is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phraseyour yorkshire friendyour correspondent in yorkshirethat would be the way i suppose if i were very badno i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress
i certainly get better and betternow for it  mrs weston was disengaged and emma began againmr
frank churchill writes one of the best gentlemans hands i ever saw  i do not admire it said mr knightley
it is too smallwants strength
it is like a womans writing  this was not submitted to by either lady
they vindicated him against the base aspersion
no it by no means wanted strengthit was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong
had not mrs weston any letter about her to produce no she had heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put it away
if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writingdesk i am sure i could produce a specimen
i have a note of hisdo not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you one day  he chose to say he was employed  well well i have that note and can shew it after dinner to convince mr knightley  oh
when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill said mr knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse he will of course put forth his best  dinner was on tablemrs
elton before she could be spoken to was ready and before mr woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the diningparlour was saying  must i go first
i really am ashamed of always leading the way  janes solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma
she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any
she suspected that it had that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear and that it had not been in vain
she thought there was an air of greater happiness than usuala glow both of complexion and spirits
she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the irish mailsit was at her tongues endbut she abstained
she was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt jane fairfaxs feelings and they followed the other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance of goodwill highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom after dinner emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct partieswith so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself
she and mrs weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together
mrs elton left them no choice
if jane repressed her for a little time she soon began again and though much that passed between them was in a halfwhisper especially on mrs eltons side there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects the postofficecatching coldfetching lettersand friendship were long under discussion and to them succeeded one which must be at least equally unpleasant to janeinquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her and professions of mrs eltons meditated activity
here is april come said she i get quite anxious about you
june will soon be here  but i have never fixed on june or any other monthmerely looked forward to the summer in general  but have you really heard of nothing  i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet  oh
my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing  i not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs elton who can have thought of it as i have done  but you have not seen so much of the world as i have
you do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations
i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove
a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle
waxcandles in the schoolroom
you may imagine how desirable
of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragges is the one i would most wish to see you in  colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer said jane
i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want itafterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself
but i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present  trouble
aye i know your scruples
you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am
i shall write to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the lookout for any thing eligible  thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving any body trouble  but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us
your inexperience really amuses me
a situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you is no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moments notice indeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly  excuse me maam but this is by no means my intention i make no inquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends
when i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid of being long unemployed
there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce somethingoffices for the salenot quite of human fleshbut of human intellect  oh
my dear human flesh
you quite shock me if you mean a fling at the slavetrade i assure you mr suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition  i did not mean i was not thinking of the slavetrade replied jane governesstrade i assure you was all that i had in view widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on but as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where it lies
but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do  something that would do repeated mrs elton
aye that may suit your humble ideas of yourselfi know what a modest creature you are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation in a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command the elegancies of life  you are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent it would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications i think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison
a gentlemans family is all that i should condition for  i know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i shall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will be quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right to move in the first circle
your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like and mix in the family as much as you chosethat isi do not knowif you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure but you sing as well as playyes i really believe you might even without the harp stipulate for what you choseand you must and shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before the campbells or i have any rest  you may well class the delight the honour and the comfort of such a situation together said jane they are pretty sure to be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me
i am exceedingly obliged to you mrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer
for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am  and i am quite serious too i assure you replied mrs elton gaily in resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends to watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us  in this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing till mr woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change of object and emma heard her saying in the same halfwhisper to jane  here comes this dear old beau of mine i protestonly think of his gallantry in coming away before the other menwhat a dear creature he isi assure you i like him excessively
i admire all that quaint oldfashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease modern ease often disgusts me
but this good old mr woodhouse i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner
oh
i assure you i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous
i fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown
how do you like itselinas choicehandsome i think but i do not know whether it is not overtrimmed i have the greatest dislike to the idea of being overtrimmedquite a horror of finery
i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me
a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery
but i am quite in the minority i believe few people seem to value simplicity of dressshow and finery are every thing
i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin
do you think it will look well  the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawingroom when mr weston made his appearance among them
he had returned to a late dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over
he had been too much expected by the best judges for surprizebut there was great joy
mr woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to see him before
john knightley only was in mute astonishmentthat a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london should set off again and walk half a mile to another mans house for the sake of being in mixed company till bedtime of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers was a circumstance to strike him deeply
a man who had been in motion since eight oclock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alonesuch a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the worldcould he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party
john knightley looked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said i could not have believed it even of him  mr weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family communication which though principally addressed to mrs weston he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room
he gave her a letter it was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way and had taken the liberty of opening it
read it read it said he it will give you pleasure only a few lineswill not take you long read it to emma  the two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to every body
well he is coming you see good news i think
well what do you say to iti always told you he would be here again soon did not ianne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would not believe mein town next week you seeat the latest i dare say for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done most likely they will be there tomorrow or saturday
as to her illness all nothing of course
but it is an excellent thing to have frank among us again so near as town
they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us
this is precisely what i wanted
well pretty good news is not it
have you finished it
has emma read it all
put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now
i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way  mrs weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion
her looks and words had nothing to restrain them
she was happy she knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy
her congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak so fluently
she was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings and trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she rather thought was considerable
mr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative to want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already
it was well that he took every bodys joy for granted or he might not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley particularly delighted
they were the first entitled after mrs weston and emma to be made happyfrom them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have been too positive an interruption and finding himself close to mrs elton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her
i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you said mr weston
mrs elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope smiled most graciously
you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continuedand know him to be my son though he does not bear my name  oh
yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance
i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage  you are very obligingfrank will be extremely happy i am sure he is to be in town next week if not sooner
we have notice of it in a letter today
i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my sons hand presumed to open itthough it was not directed to meit was to mrs weston
she is his principal correspondent i assure you
i hardly ever get a letter  and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her
oh
mr westonlaughing affectedly i must protest against thata most dangerous precedent indeedi beg you will not let your neighbours follow your exampleupon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselvesoh
mr weston i could not have believed it of you  aye we men are sad fellows
you must take care of yourself mrs eltonthis letter tells usit is a short letterwritten in a hurry merely to give us noticeit tells us that they are all coming up to town directly on mrs churchills accountshe has not been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for herso they are all to move southward without loss of time  indeedfrom yorkshire i think
enscombe is in yorkshire  yes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london a considerable journey  yes upon my word very considerable
sixtyfive miles farther than from maple grove to london
but what is distance mr weston to people of large fortuneyou would be amazed to hear how my brother mr suckling sometimes flies about
you will hardly believe mebut twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again with four horses  the evil of the distance from enscombe said mr weston is that mrs churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together
in franks last letter she complained he said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncles
this you know speaks a great degree of weaknessbut now she is so impatient to be in town that she means to sleep only two nights on the roadso frank writes word
certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton
you must grant me that  no indeed i shall grant you nothing
i always take the part of my own sex
i do indeed
i give you noticeyou will find me a formidable antagonist on that point
i always stand up for womenand i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchills making incredible exertions to avoid it
selina says it is quite horror to herand i believe i have caught a little of her nicety
she always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution
does mrs churchill do the same  depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did
mrs churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for  mrs elton eagerly interposed with  oh
mr weston do not mistake me
selina is no fine lady i assure you
do not run away with such an idea  is not she
then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld  mrs elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly
it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of itand she was considering in what way she had best retract when mr weston went on
mrs
churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspectbut this is quite between ourselves
she is very fond of frank and therefore i would not speak ill of her
besides she is out of health now but that indeed by her own account she has always been
i would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much faith in mrs churchills illness  if she is really ill why not go to bath mr westonto bath or to clifton she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her
the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe
she has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever was before and she begins to want change
it is a retired place
a fine place but very retired  ayelike maple grove i dare say
nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove
such an immense plantation all round it
you seem shut out from every thingin the most complete retirementand mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion
or perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life
i always say a woman cannot have too many resourcesand i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society  frank was here in february for a fortnight  so i remember to have heard
he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition
but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world  this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by and mr weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed  my dear madam
nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible
not heard of youi believe mrs westons letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton  he had done his duty and could return to his son
when frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we might see him again which makes this days news doubly welcome
it has been completely unexpected
that is i always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn upbut nobody believed me
he and mrs weston were both dreadfully desponding
how could he contrive to come
and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again and so forthi always felt that something would happen in our favour and so it has you see
i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next  very true mr weston perfectly true
it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship when because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymens saffron robe would be put on for us
oh
the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views
the carriagewe had disappointments about the carriageone morning i remember he came to me quite in despair  she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and mr weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on
you were mentioning may
may is the very month which mrs churchill is ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place than enscombein short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole springprecisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant always inviting one out and never too hot for exercise
when he was here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal of wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know and we could not do half that we intended
now will be the time
this will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton whether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in today or tomorrow and at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house
i think it is so
i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight
i hope you will be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy
he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy
mrs westons partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose most gratifying to me
she thinks nobody equal to him  and i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour
i have heard so much in praise of mr frank churchillat the same time it is fair to observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves and are by no means implicitly guided by others
i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of himi am no flatterer  mr weston was musing
i hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor mrs churchill
if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish
you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family nor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves the whole blame of it is to be laid to her
she was the instigator
franks mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her
mr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wifes his is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome but her pride is arrogance and insolence
and what inclines one less to bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood
she was nobody when he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever since her being turned into a churchill she has outchurchilld them all in high and mighty claims but in herself i assure you she is an upstart  only think
well that must be infinitely provoking
i have quite a horror of upstarts
maple grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves
your description of mrs churchill made me think of them directly
people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families
a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows
they came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much you know mr weston
one has not great hopes from birmingham
i always say there is something direful in the sound but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things i assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours
it is infinitely too bad
mr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove and whose father had it before himi believe at leasti am almost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before his death  they were interrupted
tea was carrying round and mr weston having said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of walking away
after tea mr and mrs weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse to cards
the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent
mr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother
he was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with  well emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys but you have your sisters letter and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure
my charge would be much more concise than hers and probably not much in the same spirit all that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them and do not physic them  i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic  and if you find them troublesome you must send them home again  that is very likely
you think so do not you  i hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your fatheror even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately  increase  certainly you must be sensible that the last halfyear has made a great difference in your way of life  difference
no indeed i am not  there can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be
witness this very time
here am i come down for only one day and you are engaged with a dinnerpartywhen did it happen before or any thing like it
your neighbourhood is increasing and you mix more with it
a little while ago every letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties dinners at mr coles or balls at the crown
the difference which randalls randalls alone makes in your goingson is very great  yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all  very welland as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less influence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma that henry and john may be sometimes in the way
and if they are i only beg you to send them home  no cried mr knightley that need not be the consequence
let them be sent to donwell
i shall certainly be at leisure  upon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me
i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys
these amazing engagements of minewhat have they been
dining once with the colesand having a ball talked of which never took place
i can understand younodding at mr john knightleyyour good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed
but you turning to mr knightley who know how very very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me i cannot imagine
and as to my dear little boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent oneand who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling his accounts  mr knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded without difficulty upon mrs eltons beginning to talk to him
volume iii       a very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill
she was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him
her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking ofbut if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away it would be very distressing
if a separation of two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils before hercaution for him and for herself would be necessary
she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his
she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration
that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance
and yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive
she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis an event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state
it was not very long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchills feelings
the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards
he rode down for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all her quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced and how she must act
they met with the utmost friendliness
there could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her
but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree
she watched him well
it was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been
absence with the conviction probably of her indifference had produced this very natural and very desirable effect
he was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories and he was not without agitation
it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative indifference
he was not calm his spirits were evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him
lively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself but what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a quarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury
he had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passedhe had not stopped he would not stop for more than a wordbut he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off she had no doubt as to his being less in lovebut neither his agitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long
this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days
he was often hoping intending to comebut was always prevented
his aunt could not bear to have him leave her
such was his own account at randalls
if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come it was to be inferred that mrs churchills removal to london had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder
that she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself convinced of it at randalls
though much might be fancy he could not doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago
he did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her but he could not be prevailed on by all his fathers doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong as ever
it soon appeared that london was not the place for her
she could not endure its noise
her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days end her nephews letter to randalls communicated a change of plan
they were going to remove immediately to richmond
mrs churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place
a readyfurnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change
emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friendsfor the house was taken for may and june
she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish
emma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects
he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered
she hoped it was not so
two months must bring it to the proof
mr westons own happiness was indisputable
he was quite delighted
it was the very circumstance he could have wished for
now it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood
what were nine miles to a young manan hours ride
he would be always coming over
the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never
sixteen milesnay eighteenit must be full eighteen to manchesterstreetwas a serious obstacle
were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning
there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse
better than nearer
one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removalthe ball at the crown
it had not been forgotten before but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day
now however it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twentyfour hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible
mr westons ball was to be a real thing
a very few tomorrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness
mr woodhouse was resigned
the time of year lightened the evil to him
may was better for every thing than february
mrs bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone
no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball
the day approached the day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching frank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before dinner and every thing was safe
no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma
the room at the crown was to witness itbut it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd
mr weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young mans company
she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just sufficiently before them
frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though he did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening
they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize
so unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr westons judgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection
emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity
she liked his open manners but a little less of openheartedness would have made him a higher charactergeneral benevolence but not general friendship made a man what he ought to beshe could fancy such a man
the whole party walked about and looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do formed a sort of halfcircle round the fire to observe in their various modes till other subjects were started that though may a fire in the evening was still very pleasant
emma found that it was not mr westons fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger
they had stopped at mrs batess door to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons
frank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness which shewed a mind not at ease
he was looking about he was going to the door he was watching for the sound of other carriagesimpatient to begin or afraid of being always near her
mrs elton was spoken of
i think she must be here soon said he
i have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much of her
it cannot be long i think before she comes  a carriage was heard
he was on the move immediately but coming back said  i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her
i have never seen either mr or mrs elton
i have no business to put myself forward  mr and mrs elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed
but miss bates and miss fairfax said mr weston looking about
we thought you were to bring them  the mistake had been slight
the carriage was sent for them now
emma longed to know what franks first opinion of mrs elton might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of graciousness
he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had passed
in a few minutes the carriage returnedsomebody talked of raini will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father miss bates must not be forgotten and away he went
mr weston was following but mrs elton detained him to gratify him by her opinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young man himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of hearing
a very fine young man indeed mr weston
you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with himyou may believe me
i never compliment
i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approveso truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism
you must know i have a vast dislike to puppiesquite a horror of them
they were never tolerated at maple grove
neither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we used sometimes to say very cutting things
selina who is mild almost to a fault bore with them much better  while she talked of his son mr westons attention was chained but when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away
mrs elton turned to mrs weston
i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane
our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditiousi believe we drive faster than any bodywhat a pleasure it is to send ones carriage for a friendi understand you were so kind as to offer but another time it will be quite unnecessary
you may be very sure i shall always take care of them  miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room and mrs elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs westons to receive them
her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma but her words every bodys words were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire
as the door opened she was heard  so very obliging of youno rain at all
nothing to signify
i do not care for myself
quite thick shoes

here it comes
every thing so good  frank churchill returned to his station by emma and as soon as miss bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little way behind herhe was thoughtful
whether he were overhearing too she could not determine
after a good many compliments to jane on her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken mrs elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herselfand it was how do you like my gownhow do you like my trimminghow has wright done my hairwith many other relative questions all answered with patient politeness
mrs elton then said nobody can think less of dress in general than i dobut upon such an occasion as this when every bodys eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westonswho i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honouri would not wish to be inferior to others
and i see very few pearls in the room except mineso frank churchill is a capital dancer i understandwe shall see if our styles suita fine young man certainly is frank churchill
i like him very well  at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear moreand the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till another suspension brought mrs eltons tones again distinctly forwardmr
elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming  oh
you have found us out at last have you in our seclusioni was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us  janerepeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and displeasurethat is easybut miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose  how do you like mrs elton said emma in a whisper
not at all  you are ungrateful  ungratefulwhat do you mean then changing from a frown to a smileno do not tell mei do not want to know what you meanwhere is my fatherwhen are we to begin dancing  emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour
he walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both mr and mrs weston
he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before emma
it had just occurred to mrs weston that mrs elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinctionemma heard the sad truth with fortitude
and what are we to do for a proper partner for her said mr weston
she will think frank ought to ask her  frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation ofand it then appeared that mrs weston was wanting him to dance with mrs elton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soonmr
weston and mrs elton led the way mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed
emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her
it was almost enough to make her think of marrying
mrs elton had undoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could not lose by the change
mr weston might be his sons superiorin spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before hershe was more disturbed by mr knightleys not dancing than by any thing elsethere he was among the standersby where he ought not to be he ought to be dancingnot classing himself with the husbands and fathers and whistplayers who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made upso young as he lookedhe could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere than where he had placed himself
his tall firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every bodys eyes and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with himhe moved a few steps nearer and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he but take the troublewhenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile but in general he was looking grave
she wished he could love a ballroom better and could like frank churchill betterhe seemed often observing her
she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid
there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner
they seemed more like cheerful easy friends than lovers
that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable
the ball proceeded pleasantly
the anxious cares the incessant attentions of mrs weston were not thrown away
every body seemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this
of very important very recordable events it was not more productive than such meetings usually are
there was one however which emma thought something ofthe two last dances before supper were begun and harriet had no partnerthe only young lady sitting downand so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonderbut emmas wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about
he would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided she was sure he would notand she was expecting him every moment to escape into the cardroom
escape however was not his plan
he came to the part of the room where the sittersby were collected spoke to some and walked about in front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution of maintaining it
he did not omit being sometimes directly before miss smith or speaking to those who were close to heremma saw it
she was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all
when she was halfway up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glancesthe kindhearted gentle mrs weston had left her seat to join him and say do not you dance mr elton to which his prompt reply was most readily mrs weston if you will dance with me  meoh
noi would get you a better partner than myself
i am no dancer  if mrs gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure i am surefor though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert  mrs
gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancingmiss smith miss smithohi had not observedyou are extremely obligingand if i were not an old married manbut my dancing days are over mrs weston
you will excuse me
any thing else i should be most happy to do at your commandbut my dancing days are over  mrs weston said no more and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat
this was mr elton
the amiable obliging gentle mr eltonshe looked round for a moment he had joined mr knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife
she would not look again
her heart was in a glow and she feared her face might be as hot
in another moment a happier sight caught hermr
knightley leading harriet to the setnever had she been more surprized seldom more delighted than at that instant
she was all pleasure and gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be thanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance said much as soon as she could catch his eye again
his dancing proved to be just what she had believed it extremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky if it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced
it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles
mr elton had retreated into the cardroom looking emma trusted very foolish
she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like hershe spoke some of her feelings by observing audibly to her partner  knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smithvery goodnatured i declare  supper was announced
the move began and miss bates might be heard from that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon
jane jane my dear jane where are youhere is your tippet
mrs weston begs you to put on your tippet
she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage though every thing has been doneone door nailed upquantities of mattingmy dear jane indeed you must
mr churchill oh
you are too obliging
how well you put it onso gratified
excellent dancing indeedyes my dear i ran home as i said i should to help grandmama to bed and got back again and nobody missed mei set off without saying a word just as i told you
grandmama was quite well had a charming evening with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat and backgammontea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away amazing luck in some of her throws and she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused and who were your partners
oh said i i shall not forestall jane i left her dancing with mr george otway she will love to tell you all about it herself tomorrow her first partner was mr elton i do not know who will ask her next perhaps mr william cox my dear sir you are too obligingis there nobody you would not ratheri am not helpless
sir you are most kind
upon my word jane on one arm and me on the otherstop stop let us stand a little back mrs elton is going dear mrs elton how elegant she looksbeautiful lacenow we all follow in her train
quite the queen of the eveningwell here we are at the passage
two steps jane take care of the two steps
oh
no there is but one
well i was persuaded there were two
how very odd
i was convinced there were two and there is but one
i never saw any thing equal to the comfort and stylecandles everywherei was telling you of your grandmama janethere was a little disappointmentthe baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again
now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagusso she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse who would be so very much concernedwell this is brilliant
i am all amazement
could not have supposed any thingsuch elegance and profusioni have seen nothing like it sincewell where shall we sit
where shall we sit
anywhere so that jane is not in a draught
where i sit is of no consequence
oh
do you recommend this sidewell i am sure mr churchillonly it seems too goodbut just as you please
what you direct in this house cannot be wrong
dear jane how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama
soup too
bless me
i should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i cannot help beginning  emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked
he was warm in his reprobation of mr eltons conduct it had been unpardonable rudeness and mrs eltons looks also received the due share of censure
they aimed at wounding more than harriet said he
emma why is it that they are your enemies  he looked with smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added she ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may beto that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet  i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me  he shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it and he only said  i shall not scold you
i leave you to your own reflections  can you trust me with such flatterersdoes my vain spirit ever tell me i am wrong  not your vain spirit but your serious spiritif one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it  i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton
there is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i did not and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet
it was through a series of strange blunders  and in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice to say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himselfharriet smith has some firstrate qualities which mrs elton is totally without
an unpretending singleminded artless girlinfinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton
i found harriet more conversable than i expected  emma was extremely gratifiedthey were interrupted by the bustle of mr weston calling on every body to begin dancing again
come miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doingcome emma set your companions the example
every body is lazy
every body is asleep  i am ready said emma whenever i am wanted  whom are you going to dance with asked mr knightley
she hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will ask me  will you said he offering his hand
indeed i will
you have shewn that you can dance and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper  brother and sister
no indeed       this little explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable pleasure
it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoyshe was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour was peculiarly gratifying
the impertinence of the eltons which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked forward to another happy resultthe cure of harriets infatuationfrom harriets manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom she had strong hopes
it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr elton was not the superior creature she had believed him
the fever was over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy
she depended on the evil feelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisiteharriet rational frank churchill not too much in love and mr knightley not wanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her
she was not to see frank churchill this morning
he had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day
she did not regret it
having arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all to rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa when the great iron sweepgate opened and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see togetherfrank churchill with harriet leaning on his armactually harrieta moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened
harriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer herthe iron gates and the frontdoor were not twenty yards asunderthey were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away
a young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered and surprizes be explained
such events are very interesting but the suspense of them cannot last long
a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole
miss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at mrs goddards who had been also at the ball had walked out together and taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public enough for safety had led them into alarmabout half a mile beyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies
a child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top and made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury
but poor harriet could not follow
she had suffered very much from cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerlessand in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged to remain
how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in wordmore and more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her illshe was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving awaybut her terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang demanding more
in this state frank churchill had found her she trembling and conditioning they loud and insolent
by a most fortunate chance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment
the pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his horses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond highburyand happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had been obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes he was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them
the terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet was then their own portion
he had left them completely frightened and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome
it was his idea to bring her to hartfield he had thought of no other place
this was the amount of the whole storyof his communication and of harriets as soon as she had recovered her senses and speechhe dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays left him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to mrs goddard and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr knightley he set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself
such an adventure as thisa fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain
so emma thought at least
could a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each otherhow much more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and foresightespecially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made
it was a very extraordinary thing
nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory no rencontre no alarm of the kindand now it had happened to the very person and at the very hour when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue herit certainly was very extraordinaryand knowing as she did the favourable state of mind of each at this period it struck her the more
he was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself she just recovering from her mania for mr elton
it seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences
it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other
in the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him while harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror her navet her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a sensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harriets own account had been given he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms
every thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled nor assisted
she would not stir a step nor drop a hint
no she had had enough of interference
there could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme
it was no more than a wish
beyond it she would on no account proceed
emmas first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passedaware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible
within half an hour it was known all over highbury
it was the very event to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news
the last nights ball seemed lost in the gipsies
poor mr woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again
it was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith were coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure of returning for answer that they were all very indifferentwhich though not exactly true for she was perfectly well and harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with
she had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not invent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message
the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off in a hurry
the young ladies of highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma and her nephewsin her imagination it maintained its ground and henry and john were still asking every day for the story of harriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital
a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after sitting down and hesitating thus began  miss woodhouseif you are at leisurei have something that i should like to tell youa sort of confession to makeand then you know it will be over  emma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak
there was a seriousness in harriets manner which prepared her quite as much as her words for something more than ordinary
it is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued to have no reserves with you on this subject
as i am happily quite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it
i do not want to say more than is necessaryi am too much ashamed of having given way as i have done and i dare say you understand me  yes said emma i hope i do  how i could so long a time be fancying myself cried harriet warmly
it seems like madness
i can see nothing at all extraordinary in him nowi do not care whether i meet him or notexcept that of the two i had rather not see himand indeed i would go any distance round to avoid himbut i do not envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her as i have done she is very charming i dare say and all that but i think her very illtempered and disagreeablei shall never forget her look the other nighthowever i assure you miss woodhouse i wish her no evilno let them be ever so happy together it will not give me another moments pang and to convince you that i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroywhat i ought to have destroyed long agowhat i ought never to have kepti know that very well blushing as she spokehowever now i will destroy it alland it is my particular wish to do it in your presence that you may see how rational i am grown
cannot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look
not the least in the worlddid he ever give you any thing  noi cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have valued very much  she held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most precious treasures on the top
her curiosity was greatly excited
harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience
within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridgeware box which harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of courtplaister
now said harriet you must recollect  no indeed i do not  dear me
i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about courtplaister one of the very last times we ever met in itit was but a very few days before i had my sore throatjust before mr and mrs john knightley camei think the very eveningdo not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife and your recommending courtplaisterbut as you had none about you and knew i had you desired me to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece but it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept playing some time with what was left before he gave it back to me
and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of itso i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat  my dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face and jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear
remember it
aye i remember it all now all except your saving this relici knew nothing of that till this momentbut the cutting the finger and my recommending courtplaister and saying i had none about meoh
my sins my sinsand i had plenty all the while in my pocketone of my senseless tricksi deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my lifewellsitting down againgo onwhat else  and had you really some at hand yourself
i am sure i never suspected it you did it so naturally  and so you actually put this piece of courtplaister by for his sake said emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement
and secretly she added to herself lord bless me
when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of courtplaister that frank churchill had been pulling about
i never was equal to this  here resumed harriet turning to her box again here is something still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable because this is what did really once belong to him which the courtplaister never did  emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure
it was the end of an old pencilthe part without any lead
this was really his said harrietdo not you remember one morningno i dare say you do not
but one morningi forget exactly the daybut perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before that evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocketbook it was about sprucebeer
mr knightley had been telling him something about brewing sprucebeer and he wanted to put it down but when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another and this was left upon the table as good for nothing
but i kept my eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never parted with it again from that moment  i do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember ittalking about sprucebeeroh
yesmr
knightley and i both saying we liked it and mr eltons seeming resolved to learn to like it too
i perfectly remember itstop mr knightley was standing just here was not he
i have an idea he was standing just here  ah
i do not know
i cannot recollectit is very odd but i cannot recollectmr
elton was sitting here i remember much about where i am now  well go on  oh
thats all
i have nothing more to shew you or to sayexcept that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire and i wish you to see me do it  my poor dear harriet
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things  yes simpleton as i wasbut i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them
it was very wrong of me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married
i knew it wasbut had not resolution enough to part with them  but harriet is it necessary to burn the courtplaisteri have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the courtplaister might be useful  i shall be happier to burn it replied harriet
it has a disagreeable look to me
i must get rid of every thingthere it goes and there is an end thank heaven
of mr elton  and when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr churchill  she had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had told no fortune might be proved to have made harrietsabout a fortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation and quite undesignedly
emma was not thinking of it at the moment which made the information she received more valuable
she merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet whenever you marry i would advise you to do so and soand thought no more of it till after a minutes silence she heard harriet say in a very serious tone i shall never marry  emma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a moments debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied  never marrythis is a new resolution  it is one that i shall never change however  after another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed fromi hope it is not in compliment to mr elton  mr
elton indeed cried harriet indignantlyoh
noand emma could just catch the words so superior to mr elton  she then took a longer time for consideration
should she proceed no farthershould she let it pass and seem to suspect nothingperhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did or perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive harriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolvedshe believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once all that she meant to say and know
plain dealing was always best
she had previously determined how far she would proceed on any application of the sort and it would be safer for both to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speedshe was decided and thus spoke  harriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning
your resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you
is not it so  oh
miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose indeed i am not so madbut it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distanceand to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration which are so proper in me especially  i am not at all surprized at you harriet
the service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart  service
oh
it was such an inexpressible obligationthe very recollection of it and all that i felt at the timewhen i saw him cominghis noble lookand my wretchedness before
such a change
in one moment such a change
from perfect misery to perfect happiness  it is very natural
it is natural and it is honourableyes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefullybut that it will be a fortunate preference is more than i can promise
i do not advise you to give way to it harriet
i do not by any means engage for its being returned
consider what you are about
perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you
be observant of him
let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations
i give you this caution now because i shall never speak to you again on the subject
i am determined against all interference
henceforward i know nothing of the matter
let no name ever pass our lips
we were very wrong before we will be cautious nowhe is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity
but take care of yourself
i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value  harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude
emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend
its tendency would be to raise and refine her mindand it must be saving her from the danger of degradation
in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon hartfield
to highbury in general it brought no material change
the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings and of the use to be made of their barouchelandau and jane fairfax was still at her grandmothers and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat mrs eltons activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will
mr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike him more
he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of emma
that emma was his object appeared indisputable
every thing declared it his own attentions his fathers hints his motherinlaws guarded silence it was all in unison words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story
but while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him over to harriet mr knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax
he could not understand it but there were symptoms of intelligence between themhe thought so at leastsymptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emmas errors of imagination
she was not present when the suspicion first arose
he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which from the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place
when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight  myself creating what i saw   brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane
he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at hartfield
emma and harriet were going to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain mr and mrs weston and their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met
they all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him
the randalls party agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech from miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouses most obliging invitation
as they were turning into the grounds mr perry passed by on horseback
the gentlemen spoke of his horse
by the bye said frank churchill to mrs weston presently what became of mr perrys plan of setting up his carriage  mrs weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he ever had any such plan  nay i had it from you
you wrote me word of it three months ago  me
impossible  indeed you did
i remember it perfectly
you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon
mrs perry had told somebody and was extremely happy about it
it was owing to her persuasion as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm
you must remember it now  upon my word i never heard of it till this moment  never
really neverbless me
how could it bethen i must have dreamt itbut i was completely persuadedmiss smith you walk as if you were tired
you will not be sorry to find yourself at home  what is thiswhat is this cried mr weston about perry and a carriage
is perry going to set up his carriage frank
i am glad he can afford it
you had it from himself had you  no sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it from nobodyvery oddi really was persuaded of mrs westons having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago with all these particularsbut as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream
i am a great dreamer
i dream of every body at highbury when i am awayand when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin dreaming of mr and mrs perry  it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe
perrys setting up his carriage
and his wifes persuading him to it out of care for his healthjust what will happen i have no doubt some time or other only a little premature
what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream
and at others what a heap of absurdities it is
well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent
emma you are a great dreamer i think  emma was out of hearing
she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach of mr westons hint
why to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject there is no denying that mr frank churchill might havei do not mean to say that he did not dream iti am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the worldbut if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselvesbut it was quite a secret known to nobody else and only thought of about three days
mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed
jane dont you remember grandmamas telling us of it when we got home
i forget where we had been walking tovery likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls
mrs perry was always particularly fond of my motherindeed i do not know who is notand she had mentioned it to her in confidence she had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not to go beyond and from that day to this i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of
at the same time i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware
i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not
i am not like jane i wish i were
i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world
where is sheoh
just behind
perfectly remember mrs perrys comingextraordinary dream indeed  they were entering the hall
mr knightleys eyes had preceded miss batess in a glance at jane
from frank churchills face where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl
mr weston had walked in
the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass
mr knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eyehe seemed watching her intentlyin vain however if it were sojane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither
there was no time for farther remark or explanation
the dream must be borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the smallsized pembroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded
tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move
miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabetstheir box of letters
it used to stand here
where is it
this is a sort of dulllooking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer
we had great amusement with those letters one morning
i want to puzzle you again  emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves
they were rapidly forming words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled
the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort which mr weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it
frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax
she gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it
frank was next to emma jane opposite to themand mr knightley so placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much as he could with as little apparent observation
the word was discovered and with a faint smile pushed away
if meant to be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word and finding out none directly took it up and fell to work
she was sitting by mr knightley and turned to him for help
the word was blunder and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a blush on janes cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible
mr knightley connected it with the dream but how it could all be was beyond his comprehension
how the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep
he feared there must be some decided involvement
disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn
these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick
it was a childs play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank churchills part
with great indignation did he continue to observe him with great alarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions
he saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look sly and demure
he saw that emma had soon made it out and found it highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure for she said nonsense
for shame he heard frank churchill next say with a glance towards jane i will give it to hershall iand as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth
no no you must not you shall not indeed  it was done however
this gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it
mr knightleys excessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was not long before he saw it to be dixon
jane fairfaxs perception seemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters so arranged
she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing herself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her and saying only i did not know that proper names were allowed pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered
her face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned towards her aunt
aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not spoken a wordi was just going to say the same thing
it is time for us to be going indeed
the evening is closing in and grandmama will be looking for us
my dear sir you are too obliging
we really must wish you good night  janes alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived
she was immediately up and wanting to quit the table but so many were also moving that she could not get away and mr knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined
she was afterwards looking for her shawlfrank churchill was looking alsoit was growing dusk and the room was in confusion and how they parted mr knightley could not tell
he remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full of what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist his observations he mustyes he certainly must as a friendan anxious friendgive emma some hint ask her some question
he could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to preserve her
it was his duty
pray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax
i saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other  emma was extremely confused
she could not endure to give him the true explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them
oh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing a mere joke among ourselves  the joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you and mr churchill  he had hoped she would speak again but she did not
she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak
he sat a little while in doubt
a variety of evils crossed his mind
interferencefruitless interference
emmas confusion and the acknowledged intimacy seemed to declare her affection engaged
yet he would speak
he owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter any thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause
my dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of  between mr frank churchill and miss fairfax
oh
yes perfectlywhy do you make a doubt of it  have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her or that she admired him  never never she cried with a most open eagernessnever for the twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me
and how could it possibly come into your head  i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between themcertain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public  oh
you amuse me excessively
i am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wanderbut it will not dovery sorry to check you in your first essaybut indeed it will not do
there is no admiration between them i do assure you and the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some peculiar circumstancesfeelings rather of a totally different natureit is impossible exactly to explainthere is a good deal of nonsense in itbut the part which is capable of being communicated which is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be
that is i presume it to be so on her side and i can answer for its being so on his
i will answer for the gentlemans indifference  she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction which silenced mr knightley
she was in gay spirits and would have prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her but his gaiety did not meet hers
he found he could not be useful and his feelings were too much irritated for talking
that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever by the fire which mr woodhouses tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey
after being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr and mrs suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn
no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present
in the daily interchange of news they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings coming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs churchill whose health seemed every day to supply a different report and the situation of mrs weston whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it
mrs elton was very much disappointed
it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade
her introductions and recommendations must all wait and every projected party be still only talked of
so she thought at firstbut a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off
why should not they explore to box hill though the sucklings did not come
they could go there again with them in the autumn
it was settled that they should go to box hill
that there was to be such a party had been long generally known it had even given the idea of another
emma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and mr weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither
two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings
this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from mr weston that he had been proposing to mrs elton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as mrs elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection
now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton of which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth bringing forward againit could not be done without a reproof to him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs eltons party
every feeling was offended and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr westons temper
i am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably
but i thought you would
such schemes as these are nothing without numbers
one cannot have too large a party
a large party secures its own amusement
and she is a goodnatured woman after all
one could not leave her out  emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private
it was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs elton was growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr weston as to pigeonpies and cold lamb when a lame carriagehorse threw every thing into sad uncertainty
it might be weeks it might be only a few days before the horse were useable but no preparations could be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation
mrs eltons resources were inadequate to such an attack
is not this most vexatious knightley she criedand such weather for exploringthese delays and disappointments are quite odious
what are we to dothe year will wear away at this rate and nothing done
before this time last year i assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from maple grove to kings weston  you had better explore to donwell replied mr knightley
that may be done without horses
come and eat my strawberries
they are ripening fast  if mr knightley did not begin seriously he was obliged to proceed so for his proposal was caught at with delight and the oh
i should like it of all things was not plainer in words than manner
donwell was famous for its strawberrybeds which seemed a plea for the invitation but no plea was necessary cabbagebeds would have been enough to tempt the lady who only wanted to be going somewhere
she promised him again and again to comemuch oftener than he doubtedand was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it
you may depend upon me said she
i certainly will come
name your day and i will come
you will allow me to bring jane fairfax  i cannot name a day said he till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you  oh
leave all that to me
only give me a carteblanchei am lady patroness you know
it is my party
i will bring friends with me  i hope you will bring elton said he but i will not trouble you to give any other invitations  oh
now you are looking very sly
but consideryou need not be afraid of delegating power to me
i am no young lady on her preferment
married women you know may be safely authorised
it is my party
leave it all to me
i will invite your guests  nohe calmly repliedthere is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is  mrs
weston i suppose interrupted mrs elton rather mortified
nomrs
knightleyand till she is in being i will manage such matters myself  ah
you are an odd creature she cried satisfied to have no one preferred to herselfyou are a humourist and may say what you like
quite a humourist
well i shall bring jane with mejane and her auntthe rest i leave to you
i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family
dont scruple
i know you are attached to them  you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call on miss bates in my way home  thats quite unnecessary i see jane every daybut as you like
it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing
i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm
hereprobably this basket with pink ribbon
nothing can be more simple you see
and jane will have such another
there is to be no form or paradea sort of gipsy party
we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under treesand whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doorsa table spread in the shade you know
every thing as natural and simple as possible
is not that your idea  not quite
my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the diningroom
the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors
when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house  wellas you please only dont have a great set out
and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinionpray be sincere knightley
if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges or to inspect anything  i have not the least wish for it i thank you  wellbut if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever  i will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever and would spurn any bodys assistance  i wish we had a donkey
the thing would be for us all to come on donkeys jane miss bates and meand my caro sposo walking by
i really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey
in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at homeand very long walks you knowin summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt  you will not find either between donwell and highbury
donwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry
come on a donkey however if you prefer it
you can borrow mrs coles
i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible  that i am sure you would
indeed i do you justice my good friend
under that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the warmest heart
as i tell mr e you are a thorough humouristyes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme
you have hit upon the very thing to please me  mr knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade
he wished to persuade mr woodhouse as well as emma to join the party and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill mr woodhouse must not under the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two spent at donwell be tempted away to his misery
he was invited on good faith
no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity
he did consent
he had not been at donwell for two years
some very fine morning he and emma and harriet could go very well and he could sit still with mrs weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens
he did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of the day
he should like to see the old house again exceedingly and should be very happy to meet mr and mrs elton and any other of his neighbourshe could not see any objection at all to his and emmas and harriets going there some very fine morning
he thought it very well done of mr knightley to invite themvery kind and sensiblemuch cleverer than dining outhe was not fond of dining out  mr knightley was fortunate in every bodys most ready concurrence
the invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if like mrs elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselvesemma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it and mr weston unasked promised to get frank over to join them if possible a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed withmr
knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him and mr weston engaged to lose no time in writing and spare no arguments to induce him to come
in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell was settled for one day and box hill for the nextthe weather appearing exactly right
under a bright midday sun at almost midsummer mr woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down to partake of this alfresco party and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise every body to come and sit down and not to heat themselvesmrs
weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired and sit all the time with him remained when all the others were invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser
it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her fathers comfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family
she felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and shelteredits ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sightand its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted upthe house was larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good deal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable and one or two handsome roomsit was just what it ought to be and it looked what it wasand emma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility untainted in blood and understandingsome faults of temper john knightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably
she had given them neither men nor names nor places that could raise a blush
these were pleasant feelings and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did and collect round the strawberrybedsthe whole party were assembled excepting frank churchill who was expected every moment from richmond and mrs elton in all her apparatus of happiness her large bonnet and her basket was very ready to lead the way in gathering accepting or talkingstrawberries and only strawberries could now be thought or spoken ofthe best fruit in englandevery bodys favouritealways wholesomethese the finest beds and finest sortsdelightful to gather for ones selfthe only way of really enjoying themmorning decidedly the best timenever tiredevery sort goodhautboy infinitely superiorno comparisonthe others hardly eatablehautboys very scarcechili preferredwhite wood finest flavour of allprice of strawberries in londonabundance about bristolmaple grovecultivationbeds when to be renewedgardeners thinking exactly differentno general rulegardeners never to be put out of their waydelicious fruitonly too rich to be eaten much ofinferior to cherriescurrants more refreshingonly objection to gathering strawberries the stoopingglaring suntired to deathcould bear it no longermust go and sit in the shade  such for half an hour was the conversationinterrupted only once by mrs weston who came out in her solicitude after her soninlaw to inquire if he were comeand she was a little uneasyshe had some fears of his horse
seats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs elton and jane fairfax were talking ofa situation a most desirable situation was in question
mrs elton had received notice of it that morning and was in raptures
it was not with mrs suckling it was not with mrs bragge but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them it was with a cousin of mrs bragge an acquaintance of mrs suckling a lady known at maple grove
delightful charming superior first circles spheres lines ranks every thingand mrs elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediatelyon her side all was warmth energy and triumphand she positively refused to take her friends negative though miss fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge beforestill mrs elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrows posthow jane could bear it at all was astonishing to emmashe did look vexed she did speak pointedlyand at last with a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removalshould not they walk
would not mr knightley shew them the gardensall the gardensshe wished to see the whole extentthe pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear
it was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered dispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river seemed the finish of the pleasure groundsit led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had been there
disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely prettythe considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with woodand at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered rose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it
it was a sweet viewsweet to the eye and the mind
english verdure english culture english comfort seen under a sun bright without being oppressive
in this walk emma and mr weston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived mr knightley and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way
mr knightley and harrietit was an odd ttette but she was glad to see itthere had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony
now they seemed in pleasant conversation
there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not
it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom and light column of smoke ascendingshe joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around
he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc
and emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my own concerns
i have a right to talk on such subjects without being suspected of introducing robert martinshe did not suspect him
it was too old a storyrobert martin had probably ceased to think of harrietthey took a few turns together along the walkthe shade was most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day
the next remove was to the house they must all go in and eatand they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come
mrs weston looked and looked in vain
his father would not own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare
he had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty
his aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting over to themmrs
churchills state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependenceand mrs weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of mrs churchill that he was prevented comingemma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion
the cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fishponds perhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting on the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot and growing cool againmr
woodhouse who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens where no damps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more and his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need
mr knightley had done all in his power for mr woodhouses entertainment
books of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning and the kindness had perfectly answered
mr woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused
mrs weston had been shewing them all to him and now he would shew them all to emmafortunate in having no other resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodicalbefore this second looking over was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of the entrance and groundplot of the houseand was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escapelittle expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there was a start at first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of
will you be so kind said she when i am missed as to say that i am gone homei am going this momentmy aunt is not aware how late it is nor how long we have been absentbut i am sure we shall be wanted and i am determined to go directlyi have said nothing about it to any body
it would only be giving trouble and distress
some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk
till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone  certainly if you wish itbut you are not going to walk to highbury alone  yeswhat should hurt mei walk fast
i shall be at home in twenty minutes  but it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone
let my fathers servant go with youlet me order the carriage
it can be round in five minutes  thank you thank youbut on no accounti would rather walkand for me to be afraid of walking alonei who may so soon have to guard others  she spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now
i must order the carriage
the heat even would be dangeryou are fatigued already  i amshe answeredi am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatiguequick walking will refresh memiss woodhouse we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits
mine i confess are exhausted
the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let me have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary  emma had not another word to oppose
she saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend
her parting look was gratefuland her parting words oh
miss woodhouse the comfort of being sometimes aloneseemed to burst from an overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who loved her best
such a home indeed
such an aunt said emma as she turned back into the hall again
i do pity you
and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you  jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only accomplished some views of st marks place venice when frank churchill entered the room
emma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of himbut she was very glad to see him
mrs weston would be at ease
the black mare was blameless they were right who had named mrs churchill as the cause
he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her a nervous seizure which had lasted some hoursand he had quite given up every thought of coming till very lateand had he known how hot a ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be he believed he should not have come at all
the heat was excessive he had never suffered any thing like italmost wished he had staid at homenothing killed him like heathe could bear any degree of cold etc but heat was intolerableand he sat down at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of mr woodhouses fire looking very deplorable
you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma
as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again
i could very ill be sparedbut such a point had been made of my coming
you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up
i met one as i camemadness in such weatherabsolute madness  emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchills state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour
some people were always cross when they were hot
such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the diningroomand she humanely pointed out the door
nohe should not eat
he was not hungry it would only make him hotter in two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about sprucebeer walked off
emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret  i am glad i have done being in love with him
i should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning
harriets sweet easy temper will not mind it  he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came back all the bettergrown quite cooland with good manners like himselfable to draw a chair close to them take an interest in their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he should be so late
he was not in his best spirits but seemed trying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense very agreeably
they were looking over views in swisserland
as soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad said he
i shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places
you will have my sketches some time or other to look ator my tour to reador my poem
i shall do something to expose myself  that may bebut not by sketches in swisserland
you will never go to swisserland
your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave england  they may be induced to go too
a warm climate may be prescribed for her
i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad
i assure you i have
i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad
i ought to travel
i am tired of doing nothing
i want a change
i am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancyi am sick of englandand would leave it tomorrow if i could  you are sick of prosperity and indulgence
cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay  i sick of prosperity and indulgence
you are quite mistaken
i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged
i am thwarted in every thing material
i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person  you are not quite so miserable though as when you first came
go and eat and drink a little more and you will do very well
another slice of cold meat another draught of madeira and water will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us  noi shall not stir
i shall sit by you
you are my best cure  we are going to box hill tomorrowyou will join us
it is not swisserland but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change
you will stay and go with us  no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening  but you may come again in the cool of tomorrow morning  noit will not be worth while
if i come i shall be cross  then pray stay at richmond  but if i do i shall be crosser still
i can never bear to think of you all there without me  these are difficulties which you must settle for yourself
chuse your own degree of crossness
i shall press you no more  the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected
with some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill others took it very composedly but there was a very general distress and disturbance on miss fairfaxs disappearance being explained
that it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with a short final arrangement for the next days scheme they parted
frank churchills little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to emma were  wellif you wish me to stay and join the party i will  she smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening
they had a very fine day for box hill and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality were in favour of a pleasant party
mr weston directed the whole officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every body was in good time
emma and harriet went together miss bates and her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback
mrs weston remained with mr woodhouse
nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there
seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency
there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union which could not be got over
they separated too much into parties
the eltons walked together mr knightley took charge of miss bates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill
and mr weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better
it seemed at first an accidental division but it never materially varied
mr and mrs elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix and be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation between the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any cold collation or any cheerful mr weston to remove
at first it was downright dulness to emma
she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid
he said nothing worth hearinglooked without seeingadmired without intelligencelistened without knowing what she said
while he was so dull it was no wonder that harriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable
when they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better for frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object
every distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her
to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared forand emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe
mr
frank churchill and miss woodhouse flirted together excessively they were laying themselves open to that very phraseand to having it sent off in a letter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another
not that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected
she laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart
she still intended him for her friend
how much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come todayif it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party
i had quite determined to go away again  yes you were very cross and i do not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries
i was a kinder friend than you deserved
but you were humble
you begged hard to be commanded to come  dont say i was cross
i was fatigued
the heat overcame me  it is hotter today  not to my feelings
i am perfectly comfortable today  you are comfortable because you are under command  your commandyes  perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant selfcommand
you had somehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your own management but today you are got back againand as i cannot be always with you it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine  it comes to the same thing
i can have no selfcommand without a motive
you order me whether you speak or not
and you can be always with me
you are always with me  dating from three oclock yesterday
my perpetual influence could not begin earlier or you would not have been so much out of humour before  three oclock yesterday
that is your date
i thought i had seen you first in february  your gallantry is really unanswerable
but lowering her voicenobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people  i say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively impudence
i saw you first in february
let every body on the hill hear me if they can
let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking on the other
i saw you first in february and then whisperingour companions are excessively stupid
what shall we do to rouse them
any nonsense will serve
they shall talk
ladies and gentlemen i am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides to say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of  some laughed and answered goodhumouredly
miss bates said a great deal mrs elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouses presiding mr knightleys answer was the most distinct
is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of  oh
no nocried emma laughing as carelessly as she couldupon no account in the world
it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now
let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of
i will not say quite all
there are one or two perhaps glancing at mr weston and harriet whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing  it is a sort of thing cried mrs elton emphatically which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into
though perhaps as the chaperon of the partyi never was in any circleexploring partiesyoung ladiesmarried women  her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply  very true my love very true
exactly so indeedquite unheard ofbut some ladies say any thing
better pass it off as a joke
every body knows what is due to you  it will not do whispered frank to emma they are most of them affronted
i will attack them with more address
ladies and gentlemeni am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general way
here are seven of you besides myself who she is pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose or verse original or repeatedor two things moderately cleveror three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily at them all  oh
very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy
three things very dull indeed that will just do for me you know
i shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open my mouth shant i
looking round with the most goodhumoured dependence on every bodys assentdo not you all think i shall  emma could not resist
ah
maam but there may be a difficulty
pardon mebut you will be limited as to numberonly three at once  miss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not immediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could not anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her
ahwellto be sure
yes i see what she means turning to mr knightley and i will try to hold my tongue
i must make myself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend  i like your plan cried mr weston
agreed agreed
i will do my best
i am making a conundrum
how will a conundrum reckon  low i am afraid sir very low answered his sonbut we shall be indulgentespecially to any one who leads the way  no no said emma it will not reckon low
a conundrum of mr westons shall clear him and his next neighbour
come sir pray let me hear it  i doubt its being very clever myself said mr weston
it is too much a matter of fact but here it iswhat two letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection  what two lettersexpress perfection
i am sure i do not know  ah
you will never guess
you to emma i am certain will never guessi will tell youm
and aemmado you understand  understanding and gratification came together
it might be a very indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in itand so did frank and harrietit did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid about it and mr knightley gravely said  this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston has done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every body else
perfection should not have come quite so soon  oh
for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs elton i really cannot attempti am not at all fond of the sort of thing
i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not at all pleased with
i knew who it came from
an abominable puppyyou know who i mean nodding to her husband
these kind of things are very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire but quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring about the country in summer
miss woodhouse must excuse me
i am not one of those who have witty things at every bodys service
i do not pretend to be a wit
i have a great deal of vivacity in my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue
pass us if you please mr churchill
pass mr e knightley jane and myself
we have nothing clever to saynot one of us
yes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of sneering consciousness i have nothing to say that can entertain miss woodhouse or any other young lady
an old married manquite good for nothing
shall we walk augusta  with all my heart
i am really tired of exploring so long on one spot
come jane take my other arm  jane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off
happy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out of hearinghow well they suit one anothervery luckymarrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public placethey only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath
peculiarly luckyfor as to any real knowledge of a persons disposition that bath or any public place can giveit is all nothing there can be no knowledge
it is only by seeing women in their own homes among their own set just as they always are that you can form any just judgment
short of that it is all guess and luckand will generally be illluck
how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life  miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now
such things do occur undoubtedlyshe was stopped by a cough
frank churchill turned towards her to listen
you were speaking said he gravely
she recovered her voice
i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them to be very frequent
a hasty and imprudent attachment may arisebut there is generally time to recover from it afterwards
i would be understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience an oppression for ever  he made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon afterwards said in a lively tone  well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me
will you
turning to emma
will you chuse a wife for mei am sure i should like any body fixed on by you
you provide for the family you know with a smile at his father
find some body for me
i am in no hurry
adopt her educate her  and make her like myself  by all means if you can  very well
i undertake the commission
you shall have a charming wife  she must be very lively and have hazle eyes
i care for nothing else
i shall go abroad for a couple of yearsand when i return i shall come to you for my wife
remember  emma was in no danger of forgetting
it was a commission to touch every favourite feeling
would not harriet be the very creature described
hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished
he might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment who could say
referring the education to her seemed to imply it
now maam said jane to her aunt shall we join mrs elton  if you please my dear
with all my heart
i am quite ready
i was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well
we shall soon overtake her
there she isno thats somebody else
thats one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like herwell i declare  they walked off followed in half a minute by mr knightley
mr weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young mans spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant
even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her
the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of mrs elton to have her carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure
such another scheme composed of so many illassorted people she hoped never to be betrayed into again
while waiting for the carriage she found mr knightley by her side
he looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said  emma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still use it
i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance
how could you be so unfeeling to miss bates
how could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situationemma i had not thought it possible  emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off
nay how could i help saying what i didnobody could have helped it
it was not so very bad
i dare say she did not understand me  i assure you she did
she felt your full meaning
she has talked of it since
i wish you could have heard how she talked of itwith what candour and generosity
i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome  oh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her  they are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good
were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner
were she your equal in situationbut emma consider how far this is from being the case
she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more
her situation should secure your compassion
it was badly done indeed
you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble herand before her niece tooand before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of herthis is not pleasant to you emmaand it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i willi will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now  while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in
he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless
they were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern
she had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcomethen reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference but it was just too late
he had turned away and the horses were in motion
she continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind
she was vexed beyond what could have been expressedalmost beyond what she could conceal
never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life
she was most forcibly struck
the truth of this representation there was no denying
she felt it at her heart
how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates
how could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued
and how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude of concurrence of common kindness
time did not compose her
as she reflected more she seemed but to feel it more
she never had been so depressed
happily it was not necessary to speak
there was only harriet who seemed not in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were
the wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emmas thoughts all the evening
how it might be considered by the rest of the party she could not tell
they in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than any she had ever passed
a whole evening of backgammon with her father was felicity to it
there indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twentyfour to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach
as a daughter she hoped she was not without a heart
she hoped no one could have said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your fatheri must i will tell you truths while i can miss bates should never againno never
if attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven
she had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious
but it should be so no more
in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse
she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her
it was not unlikely she thought that she might see mr knightley in her way or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit
she had no objection
she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers
her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not
the ladies were all at home she had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule
there was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking
she heard miss batess voice something was to be done in a hurry the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon
the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room
jane she had a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door had shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear i shall say you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are ill enough  poor old mrs bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she did not quite understand what was going on
i am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know they tell me she is well
i dare say my daughter will be here presently miss woodhouse
i hope you find a chair
i wish hetty had not gone
i am very little ablehave you a chair maam
do you sit where you like
i am sure she will be here presently  emma seriously hoped she would
she had a moments fear of miss bates keeping away from her
but miss bates soon camevery happy and obligedbut emmas conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as beforeless ease of look and manner
a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead the way to a return of old feelings
the touch seemed immediate
ah
miss woodhouse how kind you arei suppose you have heardand are come to give us joy
this does not seem much like joy indeed in metwinkling away a tear or twobut it will be very trying for us to part with her after having had her so long and she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morningsuch long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell and mrs dixon
my dear said i you will blind yourselffor tears were in her eyes perpetually
one cannot wonder one cannot wonder
it is a great change and though she is amazingly fortunatesuch a situation i suppose as no young woman before ever met with on first going outdo not think us ungrateful miss woodhouse for such surprising good fortuneagain dispersing her tearsbut poor dear soul
if you were to see what a headache she has
when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve
she is as low as possible
to look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation
you will excuse her not coming to youshe is not ableshe is gone into her own roomi want her to lie down upon the bed
my dear said i i shall say you are laid down upon the bed but however she is not she is walking about the room
but now that she has written her letters she says she shall soon be well
she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will excuse her
you were kept waiting at the doori was quite ashamedbut somehow there was a little bustlefor it so happened that we had not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did not know any body was coming
it is only mrs cole said i depend upon it
nobody else would come so early well said she it must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now but then patty came in and said it was you
oh said i it is miss woodhouse i am sure you will like to see heri can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away and that was what made us keep you waitingand extremely sorry and ashamed we were
if you must go my dear said i you must and i will say you are laid down upon the bed  emma was most sincerely interested
her heart had been long growing kinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very naturally resolve on seeing mrs cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself
she spoke as she felt with earnest regret and solicitudesincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually determined on might be as much for miss fairfaxs advantage and comfort as possible
it must be a severe trial to them all
she had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbells return  so very kind replied miss bates
but you are always kind  there was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of  wheremay i askis miss fairfax going  to a mrs smallridgecharming womanmost superiorto have the charge of her three little girlsdelightful children
impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort if we except perhaps mrs sucklings own family and mrs bragges but mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very same neighbourhoodlives only four miles from maple grove
jane will be only four miles from maple grove  mrs
elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes  yes our good mrs elton
the most indefatigable true friend
she would not take a denial
she would not let jane say no for when jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday the very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it she was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the reasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind to close with nothing till colonel campbells return and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at presentand so she told mrs elton over and over againand i am sure i had no more idea that she would change her mindbut that good mrs elton whose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did
it is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did and refuse to take janes answer but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her she would waitand sure enough yesterday evening it was all settled that jane should go
quite a surprize to me
i had not the least ideajane took mrs elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridges situation she had come to the resolution of accepting iti did not know a word of it till it was all settled  you spent the evening with mrs elton  yes all of us mrs elton would have us come
it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley
you must all spend your evening with us said shei positively must have you all come  mr
knightley was there too was he  no not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i thought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let him off he did notbut my mother and jane and i were all there and a very agreeable evening we had
such kind friends you know miss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body seemed rather fagged after the mornings party
even pleasure you know is fatiguingand i cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it
however i shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it  miss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been making up her mind the whole day  i dare say she had  whenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all her friendsbut i hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possiblei mean as to the character and manners of the family  thank you dear miss woodhouse
yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it
except the sucklings and bragges there is not such another nursery establishment so liberal and elegant in all mrs eltons acquaintance
mrs smallridge a most delightful womana style of living almost equal to maple groveand as to the children except the little sucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere
jane will be treated with such regard and kindnessit will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasureand her salaryi really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse
even you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like jane  ah
madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i remember to have been myself i should think five times the amount of what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned  you are so noble in your ideas  and when is miss fairfax to leave you  very soon very soon indeed thats the worst of it
within a fortnight
mrs smallridge is in a great hurry
my poor mother does not know how to bear it
so then i try to put it out of her thoughts and say come maam do not let us think about it any more  her friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel and mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return  yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining
i was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it
it was before teastayno it could not be before tea because we were just going to cardsand yet it was before tea because i remember thinkingoh
no now i recollect now i have it something happened before tea but not that
mr elton was called out of the room before tea old john abdys son wanted to speak with him
poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twentyseven years and now poor old man he is bedridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his jointsi must go and see him today and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all
and poor johns son came to talk to mr elton about relief from the parish he is very well to do himself you know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing of that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help and so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond
that was what happened before tea
it was after tea that jane spoke to mrs elton  miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr frank churchills going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence
what mr elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the accumulation of the ostlers own knowledge and the knowledge of the servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over from richmond soon after the return of the party from box hillwhich messenger however had been no more than was expected and that mr churchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing upon the whole a tolerable account of mrs churchill and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early but that mr frank churchill having resolved to go home directly without waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold tom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace and driving very steady
there was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it caught emmas attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind
the contrast between mrs churchills importance in the world and jane fairfaxs struck her one was every thing the other nothingand she sat musing on the difference of womans destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed till roused by miss batess saying  aye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte
what is to become of thatvery true
poor dear jane was talking of it just nowyou must go said she
you and i must part
you will have no business herelet it stay however said she give it houseroom till colonel campbell comes back
i shall talk about it to him he will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficultiesand to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughters  now emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave
emmas pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted but on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her
mr knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her fathermr
knightley immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said  i would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare and therefore must now be gone directly
i am going to london to spend a few days with john and isabella
have you any thing to send or say besides the love which nobody carries  nothing at all
but is not this a sudden scheme  yesratheri have been thinking of it some little time  emma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself
time however she thought would tell him that they ought to be friends again
while he stood as if meaning to go but not goingher father began his inquiries
well my dear and did you get there safelyand how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughteri dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming
dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before
she is always so attentive to them  emmas colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile and shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr knightleyit seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour as if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured he looked at her with a glow of regard
she was warmly gratifiedand in another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his parthe took her handwhether she had not herself made the first motion she could not sayshe might perhaps have rather offered itbut he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lipswhen from some fancy or other he suddenly let it gowhy he should feel such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not perceivehe would have judged better she thought if he had not stoppedthe intention however was indubitable and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him moreit was with him of so simple yet so dignified a natureshe could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction
it spoke such perfect amityhe left them immediately afterwardsgone in a moment
he always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance
emma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlierit would have been a great pleasure to talk over jane fairfaxs situation with mr knightleyneither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyedbut it might have happened at a better timeand to have had longer notice of it would have been pleasanterthey parted thorough friends however she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance and his unfinished gallantryit was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinionhe had been sitting with them half an hour she found
it was a pity that she had not come back earlier
in the hope of diverting her fathers thoughts from the disagreeableness of mr knightleys going to london and going so suddenly and going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad emma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence on the effect was justified it supplied a very useful checkinterested without disturbing him
he had long made up his mind to jane fairfaxs going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully but mr knightleys going to london had been an unexpected blow
i am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so comfortably settled
mrs elton is very goodnatured and agreeable and i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be
i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of
it ought to be a first object as i am sure poor miss taylors always was with me
you know my dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us
and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long  the following day brought news from richmond to throw every thing else into the background
an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs churchill
though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account she had not lived above sixandthirty hours after his return
a sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state had carried her off after a short struggle
the great mrs churchill was no more
it was felt as such things must be felt
every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried
goldsmith tells us that when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do but to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of illfame
mrs churchill after being disliked at least twentyfive years was now spoken of with compassionate allowances
in one point she was fully justified
she had never been admitted before to be seriously ill
the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints
poor mrs churchill
no doubt she had been suffering a great deal more than any body had ever supposedand continual pain would try the temper
it was a sad eventa great shockwith all her faults what would mr churchill do without her
mr churchills loss would be dreadful indeed
mr churchill would never get over iteven mr weston shook his head and looked solemn and said ah
poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his mourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense true and steady
how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both
it was also a very early speculation with emma
the character of mrs churchill the grief of her husbandher mind glanced over them both with awe and compassionand then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event how benefited how freed
she saw in a moment all the possible good
now an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter
mr churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody an easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew
all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed
harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great selfcommand
what ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing
emma was gratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance
they spoke therefore of mrs churchills death with mutual forbearance
short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans
mr churchill was better than could be expected and their first removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire was to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor to whom mr churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years
at present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on emmas side
it was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax whose prospects were closing while harriets opened and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished to shew her kindnessand with emma it was grown into a first wish
she had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness and the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy
she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew a value for her society and testify respect and consideration
she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield
a note was written to urge it
the invitation was refused and by a verbal message
miss fairfax was not well enough to write and when mr perry called at hartfield the same morning it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited though against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering under severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs smallridges at the time proposed
her health seemed for the moment completely derangedappetite quite goneand though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension of the family mr perry was uneasy about her
he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would not own it
her spirits seemed overcome
her present home he could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorderconfined always to one roomhe could have wished it otherwiseand her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description
her care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact only too great
he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them
emma listened with the warmest concern grieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful
to take herbe it only an hour or twofrom her aunt to give her change of air and scene and quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two might do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say in the most feeling language she could command that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would namementioning that she had mr perrys decided opinion in favour of such exercise for his patient
the answer was only in this short note  miss fairfaxs compliments and thanks but is quite unequal to any exercise  emma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted
in spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove to mrs batess in the hope that jane would be induced to join herbut it would not domiss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest serviceand every thing that message could do was triedbut all in vain
miss bates was obliged to return without success jane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worseemma wished she could have seen her and tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in
indeed the truth was that poor dear jane could not bear to see any bodyany body at allmrs
elton indeed could not be deniedand mrs cole had made such a pointand mrs perry had said so muchbut except them jane would really see nobody  emma did not want to be classed with the mrs eltons the mrs perrys and the mrs coles who would force themselves anywhere neither could she feel any right of preference herselfshe submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther as to her nieces appetite and diet which she longed to be able to assist
on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy and very communicative jane would hardly eat any thingmr
perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful
emma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an examination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note
in half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks from miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back it was a thing she could not takeand moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing  when emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon of the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal to any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage she could have no doubtputting every thing togetherthat jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her
she was sorry very sorry
her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself that could mr knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove
one morning about ten days after mrs churchills decease emma was called downstairs to mr weston who could not stay five minutes and wanted particularly to speak with herhe met her at the parlourdoor and hardly asking her how she did in the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say unheard by her father  can you come to randalls at any time this morningdo if it be possible
mrs weston wants to see you
she must see you  is she unwell  no no not at allonly a little agitated
she would have ordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone and that you knownodding towards her fatherhumphcan you come  certainly
this moment if you please
it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way
but what can be the matteris she really not ill  depend upon mebut ask no more questions
you will know it all in time
the most unaccountable business
but hush hush  to guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma
something really important seemed announced by his looks but as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy and settling it with her father that she would take her walk now she and mr weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls
nowsaid emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gatesnow mr weston do let me know what has happened  no nohe gravely replieddont ask me
i promised my wife to leave it all to her
she will break it to you better than i can
do not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon  break it to me cried emma standing still with terrorgood godmr
weston tell me at oncesomething has happened in brunswick square
i know it has
tell me i charge you tell me this moment what it is  no indeed you are mistaken  mr
weston do not trifle with meconsider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square
which of them is iti charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment  upon my word emma  your wordwhy not your honourwhy not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them
good heavenswhat can be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family  upon my honour said he very seriously it does not
it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley  emmas courage returned and she walked on
i was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you
i should not have used the expression
in fact it does not concern youit concerns only myselfthat is we hopehumphin short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it
i dont say that it is not a disagreeable businessbut things might be much worseif we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls  emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort
she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concernsomething just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the familysomething which the late event at richmond had brought forward
her fancy was very active
half a dozen natural children perhapsand poor frank cut offthis though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her
it inspired little more than an animating curiosity
who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceededspeaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with any other view
i do not knowone of the otwaysnot frankit is not frank i assure you
you will not see him
he is half way to windsor by this time  has your son been with you then  oh
yesdid not you knowwell well never mind  for a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more guarded and demure  yes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did  they hurried on and were speedily at randallswell my dear said he as they entered the roomi have brought her and now i hope you will soon be better
i shall leave you together
there is no use in delay
i shall not be far off if you want meand emma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he quitted the roomi have been as good as my word
she has not the least idea  mrs weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation that emmas uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly said  what is it my dear friend
something of a very unpleasant nature i find has occurreddo let me know directly what it is
i have been walking all this way in complete suspense
we both abhor suspense
do not let mine continue longer
it will do you good to speak of your distress whatever it may be  have you indeed no idea said mrs weston in a trembling voice
cannot you my dear emmacannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear  so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess  you are right
it does relate to him and i will tell you directly resuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up
he has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand
it is impossible to express our surprize
he came to speak to his father on a subjectto announce an attachment  she stopped to breathe
emma thought first of herself and then of harriet
more than an attachment indeed resumed mrs weston an engagementa positive engagementwhat will you say emmawhat will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engagednay that they have been long engaged  emma even jumped with surprizeand horrorstruck exclaimed  jane fairfaxgood god
you are not serious
you do not mean it  you may well be amazed returned mrs weston still averting her eyes and talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover you may well be amazed
but it is even so
there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since octoberformed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body
not a creature knowing it but themselvesneither the campbells nor her family nor hisit is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact it is yet almost incredible to myself
i can hardly believe iti thought i knew him  emma scarcely heard what was saidher mind was divided between two ideasher own former conversations with him about miss fairfax and poor harrietand for some time she could only exclaim and require confirmation repeated confirmation
well said she at last trying to recover herself this is a circumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i can at all comprehend it
whatengaged to her all the winterbefore either of them came to highbury  engaged since octobersecretly engagedit has hurt me emma very much
it has hurt his father equally
some part of his conduct we cannot excuse  emma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend not to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me as you are apprehensive of  mrs weston looked up afraid to believe but emmas countenance was as steady as her words
that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance when i did like him when i was very much disposed to be attached to himnay was attachedand how it came to cease is perhaps the wonder
fortunately however it did cease
i have really for some time past for at least these three months cared nothing about him
you may believe me mrs weston
this is the simple truth  mrs weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could find utterance assured her that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do
mr
weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she
on this point we have been wretched
it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each otherand we were persuaded that it was so imagine what we have been feeling on your account  i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself
but this does not acquit him mrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame
what right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged and with manners so very disengaged
what right had he to endeavour to please as he certainly didto distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention as he certainly didwhile he really belonged to anotherhow could he tell what mischief he might be doinghow could he tell that he might not be making me in love with himvery wrong very wrong indeed  from something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine  and how could she bear such behaviour
composure with a witness
to look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman before her face and not resent itthat is a degree of placidity which i can neither comprehend nor respect  there were misunderstandings between them emma he said so expressly
he had not time to enter into much explanation
he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could staybut that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said
the present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct  impropriety
oh
mrs westonit is too calm a censure
much much beyond improprietyit has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion
so unlike what a man should benone of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth and principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man should display in every transaction of his life  nay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been wrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer for his having many very many good qualities and  good god cried emma not attending to hermrs
smallridge too
jane actually on the point of going as governess
what could he mean by such horrible indelicacy
to suffer her to engage herselfto suffer her even to think of such a measure  he knew nothing about it emma
on this article i can fully acquit him
it was a private resolution of hers not communicated to himor at least not communicated in a way to carry convictiontill yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans
they burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or messageand it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project of hers which determined him to come forward at once own it all to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long  emma began to listen better
i am to hear from him soon continued mrs weston
he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now
let us wait therefore for this letter
it may bring many extenuations
it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood
dont let us be severe dont let us be in a hurry to condemn him
let us have patience
i must love him and now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point i am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready to hope that it may
they must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment  his sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done him much harm
well and how did mr churchill take it  most favourably for his nephewgave his consent with scarcely a difficulty
conceive what the events of a week have done in that family
while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there could not have been a hope a chance a possibilitybut scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required
what a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the gravehe gave his consent with very little persuasion  ah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet  this was settled last night and frank was off with the light this morning
he stopped at highbury at the batess i fancy some timeand then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever that as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hourhe was very much agitatedvery much indeedto a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen him beforein addition to all the rest there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion ofand there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal  and do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresythe campbells the dixons did none of them know of the engagement  emma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush
none not one
he positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves  well said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea and i wish them very happy
but i shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding
what has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceitespionage and treacheryto come among us with professions of openness and simplicity and such a league in secret to judge us allhere have we been the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hearthey must take the consequence if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable  i am quite easy on that head replied mrs weston
i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other which both might not have heard  you are in luckyour only blunder was confined to my ear when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady  true
but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her and as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe  at this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance from the window evidently on the watch
his wife gave him a look which invited him in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match
let us make the best of itand indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour
it is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that why should we
and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as i have always given her credit forand still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right
and how much may be said in her situation for even that error  much indeed cried emma feelingly
if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation like jane fairfaxsof such one may almost say that the world is not theirs nor the worlds law  she met mr weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance exclaiming  a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word
this was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity and exercise my talent of guessing
but you really frightened me
i thought you had lost half your property at least
and here instead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one of congratulationi congratulate you mr weston with all my heart on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in england for your daughter  a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate
his air and voice recovered their usual briskness he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered on the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing
his companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence or smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all over together and he had talked it all over again with emma in their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled and not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could possibly have done
harriet poor harrietthose were the words in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her
frank churchill had behaved very ill by herselfvery ill in many waysbut it was not so much his behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him
it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriets account that gave the deepest hue to his offencepoor harriet
to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery
mr knightley had spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been no friend to harriet smithshe was afraid she had done her nothing but disserviceit was true that she had not to charge herself in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriets imagination for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed
she might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments
her influence would have been enough
and now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented themshe felt that she had been risking her friends happiness on most insufficient grounds
common sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she must not allow herself to think of him and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for herbut with common sense she added i am afraid i have had little to do  she was extremely angry with herself
if she could not have been angry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadfulas for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account
harriet would be anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane whose troubles and whose illhealth having of course the same origin must be equally under cureher days of insignificance and evil were overshe would soon be well and happy and prosperousemma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted
this discovery laid many smaller matters open
no doubt it had been from jealousyin janes eyes she had been a rival and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed
an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison
she understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged that jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert
but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge
there was little sympathy to be spared for any body else
emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first
considering the very superior claims of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriets mind producing reserve and selfcommand it wouldshe must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible
an injunction of secresy had been among mr westons parting words
for the present the whole affair was to be completely a secret
mr churchill had made a point of it as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorumemma had promised but still harriet must be excepted
it was her superior duty
in spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet which mrs weston had just gone through by herself
the intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her she was now to be anxiously announcing to another
her heart beat quick on hearing harriets footstep and voice so she supposed had poor mrs weston felt when she was approaching randalls
could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblancebut of that unfortunately there could be no chance
well miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the roomis not this the oddest news that ever was  what news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look or voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint
about jane fairfax
did you ever hear any thing so strange
ohyou need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself
i met him just now
he told me it was to be a great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning it to any body but you but he said you knew it  what did mr weston tell yousaid emma still perplexed
oh
he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill are to be married and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while
how very odd  it was indeed so odd harriets behaviour was so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand it
her character appeared absolutely changed
she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery
emma looked at her quite unable to speak
had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with heryou perhaps mightyou blushing as she spoke who can see into every bodys heart but nobody else  upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent
can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i wastacitly if not openlyencouraging you to give way to your own feelingsi never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchills having the least regard for jane fairfax
you may be very sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly  me cried harriet colouring and astonished
why should you caution meyou do not think i care about mr frank churchill  i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a timeand not very distant eitherwhen you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him  himnever never
dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me turning away distressed
harriet cried emma after a moments pausewhat do you meangood heaven
what do you meanmistake youam i to suppose then  she could not speak another wordher voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer
harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emmas
i should not have thought it possible she began that you could have misunderstood me
i know we agreed never to name himbut considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person
mr frank churchill indeed
i do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other
i hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill who is like nobody by his side
and that you should have been so mistaken is amazingi am sure but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment i should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost to dare to think of him
at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very wordsi should not have dared to give way toi should not have thought it possiblebut if you who had been always acquainted with him  harriet cried emma collecting herself resolutelylet us understand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake
are you speaking ofmr
knightley  to be sure i am
i never could have an idea of any body elseand so i thought you knew
when we talked about him it was as clear as possible  not quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that you then said appeared to me to relate to a different person
i could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill
i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of  oh
miss woodhouse how you do forget  my dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i said on the occasion
i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely naturaland you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescuethe impression of it is strong on my memory  oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time
it was not the gipsiesit was not mr frank churchill that i meant
no
with some elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstanceof mr knightleys coming and asking me to dance when mr elton would not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in the room
that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence and generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth  good god cried emma this has been a most unfortunatemost deplorable mistakewhat is to be done  you would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me
at least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been if the other had been the person and nowit is possible  she paused a few moments
emma could not speak
i do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel a great difference between the two as to me or as to any body
you must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other
but i hope miss woodhouse that supposingthat ifstrange as it may appear
but you know they were your own words that more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity had taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore it seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred beforeand if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as toif mr knightley should reallyif he does not mind the disparity i hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it and try to put difficulties in the way
but you are too good for that i am sure  harriet was standing at one of the windows
emma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said  have you any idea of mr knightleys returning your affection  yes replied harriet modestly but not fearfullyi must say that i have  emmas eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes
a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart
a mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress
she touchedshe admittedshe acknowledged the whole truth
why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with mr knightley than with frank churchill
why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriets having some hope of a return
it darted through her with the speed of an arrow that mr knightley must marry no one but herself
her own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the same few minutes
she saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before
how improperly had she been acting by harriet
how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct
what blindness what madness had led her on
it struck her with dreadful force and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world
some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all these demeritssome concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice by harrietthere would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by mr knightleybut justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindnessfor her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost extent of harriets hopes should be enquired into and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintainedor to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her rightrousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion she turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed the conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it the wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lostneither of them thought but of mr knightley and themselves
harriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad to be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge and such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation to give the history of her hopes with great though trembling delightemmas tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than harriets but they were not less
her voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must createshe listened with much inward suffering but with great outward patience to harriets detailmethodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration a substance to sink her spiritespecially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of mr knightleys most improved opinion of harriet
harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dancesemma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation
from that evening or at least from the time of miss woodhouses encouraging her to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness and sweetnesslatterly she had been more and more aware of it
when they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked by her and talked so very delightfullyhe seemed to want to be acquainted with her
emma knew it to have been very much the case
she had often observed the change to almost the same extentharriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from himand emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet
he praised her for being without art or affectation for having simple honest generous feelingsshe knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt on them to her more than oncemuch that lived in harriets memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected by emma
circumstances that might swell to half an hours relation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without some degree of witness from emma herselfthe first was his walking with her apart from the others in the limewalk at donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himselfand at first he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before in a very particular way indeedharriet could not recall it without a blush
he seemed to be almost asking her whether her affections were engagedbut as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about farmingthe second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at hartfieldthough when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutesand his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to her
the superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one article marked gave her severe pain
on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a little reflection venture the following question
might he notis not it possible that when enquiring as you thought into the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martinhe might have mr martins interest in view
but harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit
mr
martin
no indeedthere was not a hint of mr martin
i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it  when harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear miss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope
i never should have presumed to think of it at first said she but for you
you told me to observe him carefully and let his behaviour be the rule of mineand so i have
but now i seem to feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me it will not be any thing so very wonderful  the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emmas side to enable her to say on reply  harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does  harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her fathers footsteps
he was coming through the hall
harriet was too much agitated to encounter him
she could not compose herself mr woodhouse would be alarmedshe had better gowith most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another doorand the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of emmas feelings oh god
that i had never seen her  the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughtsshe was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours
every moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to herhow to understand it all
how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself and living underthe blunders the blindness of her own head and heartshe sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubberyin every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness
to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour
to that point went every leisure moment which her fathers claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind
how long had mr knightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be
when had his influence such influence begun when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank churchill had once for a short period occupiedshe looked back she compared the twocompared them as they had always stood in her estimation from the time of the latters becoming known to herand as they must at any time have been compared by her had itoh
had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparisonshe saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear
she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heartand in short that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all
this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection
this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching itshe was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to herher affection for mr knightleyevery other part of her mind was disgusting
with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every bodys feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every bodys destiny
she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothingfor she had done mischief
she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on mr knightleywere this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harrietsand even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly
mr knightley and harriet smithit was a union to distance every wonder of the kindthe attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace threadbare stale in the comparison exciting no surprize presenting no disparity affording nothing to be said or thoughtmr
knightley and harriet smithsuch an elevation on her side
such a debasement on his
it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand inconveniences to himselfcould it beno it was impossible
and yet it was far very far from impossiblewas it a new circumstance for a man of firstrate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers
was it new for one perhaps too busy to seek to be the prize of a girl who would seek himwas it new for any thing in this world to be unequal inconsistent incongruousor for chance and circumstance as second causes to direct the human fate
oh
had she never brought harriet forward
had she left her where she ought and where he had told her she oughthad she not with a folly which no tongue could express prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belongall would have been safe none of this dreadful sequel would have been
how harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to mr knightleyhow she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of itbut harriet was less humble had fewer scruples than formerlyher inferiority whether of mind or situation seemed little feltshe had seemed more sensible of mr eltons being to stoop in marrying her than she now seemed of mr knightleysalas
was not that her own doing too
who had been at pains to give harriet notions of selfconsequence but herselfwho but herself had taught her that she was to elevate herself if possible and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishmentif harriet from being humble were grown vain it was her doing too
till now that she was threatened with its loss emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with mr knightley first in interest and affectionsatisfied that it was so and feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection and only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had beenlong very long she felt she had been first for having no female connexions of his own there had been only isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella
she had herself been first with him for many years past
she had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her ownbut still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared
in spite of all her faults she knew she was dear to him might she not say very dearwhen the suggestions of hope however which must follow here presented themselves she could not presume to indulge them
harriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly exclusively passionately loved by mr knightley
she could not
she could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her
she had received a very recent proof of its impartialityhow shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates
how directly how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subjectnot too strongly for the offencebut far far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clearsighted goodwillshe had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question but there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger that harriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his regard for herwish it she must for his sakebe the consequence nothing to herself but his remaining single all his life
could she be secure of that indeed of his never marrying at all she believed she should be perfectly satisfiedlet him but continue the same mr knightley to her and her father the same mr knightley to all the world let donwell and hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence and her peace would be fully securedmarriage in fact would not do for her
it would be incompatible with what she owed to her father and with what she felt for him
nothing should separate her from her father
she would not marry even if she were asked by mr knightley
it must be her ardent wish that harriet might be disappointed and she hoped that when able to see them together again she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it wereshe should see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded herehe was expected back every day
the power of observation would be soon givenfrightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course
in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harrietit would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good to be talking of it farthershe was resolved not to be convinced as long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing harriets confidence
to talk would be only to irritateshe wrote to her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not at present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again except in the company of othersshe objected only to a ttettethey might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterdayharriet submitted and approved and was grateful
this point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emmas thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twentyfour hoursmrs
weston who had been calling on her daughterinlaw elect and took hartfield in her way home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview
mr weston had accompanied her to mrs batess and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in mrs batess parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded
a little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related
mrs weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed and mr churchill could be reconciled to the engagements becoming known as considering every thing she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reportsbut mr weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were that it would be of any consequence for such things he observed always got about emma smiled and felt that mr weston had very good reason for saying so
they had gone in shortand very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady
she had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness
the quiet heartfelt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight of her daughterwho proved even too joyous to talk as usual had been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene
they were both so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested in every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body and so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work for them
miss fairfaxs recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and declined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the course of their drive mrs weston had by gentle encouragement overcome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse on the important subject
apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr weston must necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement
mrs weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject
on the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment of so many months continued mrs weston she was energetic
this was one of her expressions
i will not say that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments but i can say that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hourand the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation that i felt at my heart  poor girl said emma
she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement  wrong
no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself
the consequence said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought
but after all the punishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct
pain is no expiation
i never can be blameless
i have been acting contrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken and the kindness i am now receiving is what my conscience tells me ought not to be do not imagine madam she continued that i was taught wrong
do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up
the error has been all my own and i do assure you that with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give i shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell  poor girl said emma again
she loves him then excessively i suppose
it must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement
her affection must have overpowered her judgment  yes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him  i am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have contributed to make her unhappy  on your side my love it was very innocently done
but she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before
one natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her unreasonable
the consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have beenthat had beenhard for him to bear
i did not make the allowances said she which i ought to have done for his temper and spiritshis delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank youi could not thank you too muchfor every wish and every endeavour to do her good
she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself  if i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanksfor oh
mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfaxwell checking herself and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten
you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars
they shew her to the greatest advantage
i am sure she is very goodi hope she will be very happy
it is fit that the fortune should be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers  such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs weston
she thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more she loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest
she talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affectionbut she had too much to urge for emmas attention it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when mrs weston ended with we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for
are you well my emma was mrs westons parting question
oh
perfectly
i am always well you know
be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible  mrs westons communications furnished emma with more food for unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax
she bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause
had she followed mr knightleys known wishes in paying that attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith she must in all probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her nowbirth abilities and education had been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received with gratitude and the otherwhat was shesupposing even that they had never become intimate friends that she had never been admitted into miss fairfaxs confidence on this important matterwhich was most probablestill in knowing her as she ought and as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to mr dixon which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of janes feelings by the levity or carelessness of frank churchills
of all the sources of evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst
she must have been a perpetual enemy
they never could have been all three together without her having stabbed jane fairfaxs peace in a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more
the evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield
the weather added what it could of gloom
a cold stormy rain set in and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible
the weather affected mr woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughters side and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before
it reminded her of their first forlorn ttette on the evening of mrs westons weddingday but mr knightley had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy
alas
such delightful proofs of hartfields attraction as those sort of visits conveyed might shortly be over
the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lostbut her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction
the prospect before her now was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelledthat might not be even partially brightened
if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must be comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness
the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself and mrs westons heart and time would be occupied by it
they should lose her and probably in great measure her husband alsofrank churchill would return among them no more and miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease to belong to highbury
they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe
all that were good would be withdrawn and if to these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach
mr knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfortno longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change his own home for theirshow was it to be endured
and if he were to be lost to them for harriets sake if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in harriets society all that he wanted if harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing emmas wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work
when it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few secondsand the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone
the weather continued much the same all the following morning and the same loneliness and the same melancholy seemed to reign at hartfieldbut in the afternoon it cleared the wind changed into a softer quarter the clouds were carried off the sun appeared it was summer again
with all the eagerness which such a transition gives emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible
never had the exquisite sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm been more attractive to her
she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce and on mr perrys coming in soon after dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubberythere with spirits freshened and thoughts a little relieved she had taken a few turns when she saw mr knightley passing through the garden door and coming towards herit was the first intimation of his being returned from london
she had been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles distantthere was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind
she must be collected and calm
in half a minute they were together
the how dye dos were quiet and constrained on each side
she asked after their mutual friends they were all wellwhen had he left themonly that morning
he must have had a wet rideyeshe meant to walk with her she found
he had just looked into the diningroom and as he was not wanted there preferred being out of doorsshe thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible cause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner in which they had been received
they walked together
he was silent
she thought he was often looking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give
and this belief produced another dread
perhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet he might be watching for encouragement to beginshe did not could not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject
he must do it all himself
yet she could not bear this silence
with him it was most unnatural
she consideredresolvedand trying to smile began  you have some news to hear now you are come back that will rather surprize you  have i said he quietly and looking at her of what nature  oh
the best nature in the worlda wedding  after waiting a moment as if to be sure she intended to say no more he replied  if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill i have heard that already  how is it possible cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs goddards in his way
i had a few lines on parish business from mr weston this morning and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened  emma was quite relieved and could presently say with a little more composure  you probably have been less surprized than any of us for you have had your suspicionsi have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a cautioni wish i had attended to itbutwith a sinking voice and a heavy sigh i seem to have been doomed to blindness  for a moment or two nothing was said and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest till she found her arm drawn within his and pressed against his heart and heard him thus saying in a tone of great sensibility speaking low  time my dearest emma time will heal the woundyour own excellent senseyour exertions for your fathers sakei know you will not allow yourself her arm was pressed again as he added in a more broken and subdued accent the feelings of the warmest friendshipindignationabominable scoundreland in a louder steadier tone he concluded with he will soon be gone
they will soon be in yorkshire
i am sorry for her
she deserves a better fate  emma understood him and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure excited by such tender consideration replied  you are very kindbut you are mistakenand i must set you right i am not in want of that sort of compassion
my blindness to what was going on led me to act by them in a way that i must always be ashamed of and i was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures but i have no other reason to regret that i was not in the secret earlier  emma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeedbut checking himselfno no i understand youforgive mei am pleased that you can say even so muchhe is no object of regret indeed
and it will not be very long i hope before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reasonfortunate that your affections were not farther entangledi could never i confess from your manners assure myself as to the degree of what you felti could only be certain that there was a preferenceand a preference which i never believed him to deservehe is a disgrace to the name of manand is he to be rewarded with that sweet young womanjane jane you will be a miserable creature  mr
knightley said emma trying to be lively but really confusedi am in a very extraordinary situation
i cannot let you continue in your error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression i have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reversebut i never have  he listened in perfect silence
she wished him to speak but he would not
she supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion
she went on however
i have very little to say for my own conducti was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleasedan old story probablya common caseand no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as i do for understanding
many circumstances assisted the temptation
he was the son of mr westonhe was continually herei always found him very pleasantand in short for with a sigh let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously they all centre in this at lastmy vanity was flattered and i allowed his attentions
latterly howeverfor some time indeedi have had no idea of their meaning any thingi thought them a habit a trick nothing that called for seriousness on my side
he has imposed on me but he has not injured me
i have never been attached to him
and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour
he never wished to attach me
it was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with anotherit was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myselfexcept that i was not blindedthat it was my good fortunethat in short i was somehow or other safe from him  she had hoped for an answer herefor a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far as she could judge deep in thought
at last and tolerably in his usual tone he said  i have never had a high opinion of frank churchilli can suppose however that i may have underrated him
my acquaintance with him has been but triflingand even if i have not underrated him hitherto he may yet turn out wellwith such a woman he has a chancei have no motive for wishing him illand for her sake whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct i shall certainly wish him well  i have no doubt of their being happy together said emma i believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached  he is a most fortunate man returned mr knightley with energy
so early in lifeat threeandtwentya period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at threeandtwenty to have drawn such a prize
what years of felicity that man in all human calculation has before himassured of the love of such a womanthe disinterested love for jane fairfaxs character vouches for her disinterestedness every thing in his favourequality of situationi mean as far as regards society and all the habits and manners that are important equality in every point but oneand that one since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wantsa man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from and he who can do it where there is no doubt of her regard must i think be the happiest of mortalsfrank churchill is indeed the favourite of fortune
every thing turns out for his goodhe meets with a young woman at a wateringplace gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatmentand had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him they could not have found her superiorhis aunt is in the wayhis aunt dieshe has only to speakhis friends are eager to promote his happinesshe had used every body illand they are all delighted to forgive himhe is a fortunate man indeed  you speak as if you envied him  and i do envy him emma
in one respect he is the object of my envy  emma could say no more
they seemed to be within half a sentence of harriet and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject if possible
she made her plan she would speak of something totally differentthe children in brunswick square and she only waited for breath to begin when mr knightley startled her by saying  you will not ask me what is the point of envyyou are determined i see to have no curiosityyou are wisebut i cannot be wise
emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment  oh
then dont speak it dont speak it she eagerly cried
take a little time consider do not commit yourself  thank you said he in an accent of deep mortification and not another syllable followed
emma could not bear to give him pain
he was wishing to confide in herperhaps to consult hercost her what it would she would listen
she might assist his resolution or reconcile him to it she might give just praise to harriet or by representing to him his own independence relieve him from that state of indecision which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as histhey had reached the house
you are going in i suppose said he
noreplied emmaquite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spokei should like to take another turn
mr perry is not gone and after proceeding a few steps she addedi stopped you ungraciously just now mr knightley and i am afraid gave you painbut if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplationas a friend indeed you may command mei will hear whatever you like
i will tell you exactly what i think  as a friendrepeated mr knightleyemma that i fear is a wordno i have no wishstay yes why should i hesitatei have gone too far already for concealmentemma i accept your offerextraordinary as it may seem i accept it and refer myself to you as a friendtell me then have i no chance of ever succeeding  he stopped in his earnestness to look the question and the expression of his eyes overpowered her
my dearest emma said he for dearest you will always be whatever the event of this hours conversation my dearest most beloved emmatell me at once
say no if it is to be saidshe could really say nothingyou are silent he cried with great animation absolutely silent
at present i ask no more  emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment
the dread of being awakened from the happiest dream was perhaps the most prominent feeling
i cannot make speeches emma he soon resumed and in a tone of such sincere decided intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincingif i loved you less i might be able to talk about it more
but you know what i amyou hear nothing but truth from mei have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne itbear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them
the manner perhaps may have as little to recommend them
god knows i have been a very indifferent loverbut you understand meyes you see you understand my feelingsand will return them if you can
at present i ask only to hear once to hear your voice  while he spoke emmas mind was most busy and with all the wonderful velocity of thought had been ableand yet without losing a wordto catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole to see that harriets hopes had been entirely groundless a mistake a delusion as complete a delusion as any of her ownthat harriet was nothing that she was every thing herself that what she had been saying relative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance her discouragement had been all received as discouragement from herselfand not only was there time for these convictions with all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to rejoice that harriets secret had not escaped her and to resolve that it need not and should notit was all the service she could now render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the twoor even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever without vouchsafing any motive because he could not marry them both emma had it not
she felt for harriet with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain
she had led her friend astray and it would be a reproach to her for ever but her judgment was as strong as her feelings and as strong as it had ever been before in reprobating any such alliance for him as most unequal and degrading
her way was clear though not quite smoothshe spoke then on being so entreatedwhat did she sayjust what she ought of course
a lady always doesshe said enough to shew there need not be despairand to invite him to say more himself
he had despaired at one period he had received such an injunction to caution and silence as for the time crushed every hopeshe had begun by refusing to hear himthe change had perhaps been somewhat suddenher proposal of taking another turn her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to might be a little extraordinaryshe felt its inconsistency but mr knightley was so obliging as to put up with it and seek no farther explanation
seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very materialmr
knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his
he had in fact been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence
he had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it
he had come in his anxiety to see how she bore frank churchills engagement with no selfish view no view at all but of endeavouring if she allowed him an opening to soothe or to counsel herthe rest had been the work of the moment the immediate effect of what he heard on his feelings
the delightful assurance of her total indifference towards frank churchill of her having a heart completely disengaged from him had given birth to the hope that in time he might gain her affection himselfbut it had been no present hopehe had only in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach herthe superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchantingthe affection which he had been asking to be allowed to create if he could was already hiswithin half an hour he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind to something so like perfect happiness that it could bear no other name
her change was equalthis one halfhour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distruston his side there had been a longstanding jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of frank churchillhe had been in love with emma and jealous of frank churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other
it was his jealousy of frank churchill that had taken him from the countrythe box hill party had decided him on going away
he would save himself from witnessing again such permitted encouraged attentionshe had gone to learn to be indifferentbut he had gone to a wrong place
there was too much domestic happiness in his brothers house woman wore too amiable a form in it isabella was too much like emmadiffering only in those striking inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him for much to have been done even had his time been longerhe had stayed on however vigorously day after daytill this very mornings post had conveyed the history of jane fairfaxthen with the gladness which must be felt nay which he did not scruple to feel having never believed frank churchill to be at all deserving emma was there so much fond solicitude so much keen anxiety for her that he could stay no longer
he had ridden home through the rain and had walked up directly after dinner to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures faultless in spite of all her faults bore the discovery
he had found her agitated and lowfrank churchill was a villain he heard her declare that she had never loved him
frank churchills character was not desperateshe was his own emma by hand and word when they returned into the house and if he could have thought of frank churchill then he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow
what totally different feelings did emma take back into the house from what she had brought outshe had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of sufferingshe was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away
they sat down to teathe same party round the same tablehow often it had been collectedand how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sunbut never in such a state of spirits never in any thing like it and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house or even the attentive daughter
poor mr woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ridecould he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr perry and talked on with much selfcontentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return
as long as mr knightley remained with them emmas fever continued but when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised and subduedand in the course of the sleepless night which was the tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious points to consider as made her feel that even her happiness must have some alloy
her fatherand harriet
she could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question
with respect to her father it was a question soon answered
she hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her fathershe even wept over the idea of it as a sin of thought
while he lived it must be only an engagement but she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of drawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to himhow to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decisionhow to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make her any possible atonement how to appear least her enemyon these subjects her perplexity and distress were very greatand her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded itshe could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a meeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from highbury andindulging in one scheme morenearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to brunswick squareisabella had been pleased with harriet and a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusementshe did not think it in harriets nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety by the streets the shops and the childrenat any rate it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself from whom every thing was due a separation for the present an averting of the evil day when they must all be together again
she rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment which left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr knightley in walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before
he had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter was brought her from randallsa very thick lettershe guessed what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading itshe was now in perfect charity with frank churchill she wanted no explanations she wanted only to have her thoughts to herselfand as for understanding any thing he wrote she was sure she was incapable of itit must be waded through however
she opened the packet it was too surely soa note from mrs weston to herself ushered in the letter from frank to mrs weston
i have the greatest pleasure my dear emma in forwarding to you the enclosed
i know what thorough justice you will do it and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effecti think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again but i will not delay you by a long prefacewe are quite wellthis letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness i have been feeling latelyi did not quite like your looks on tuesday but it was an ungenial morning and though you will never own being affected by weather i think every body feels a northeast windi felt for your dear father very much in the storm of tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning but had the comfort of hearing last night by mr perry that it had not made him ill  yours ever a
w   to mrs

windsorjuly
my dear madam   if i made myself intelligible yesterday this letter will be expected but expected or not i know it will be read with candour and indulgenceyou are all goodness and i believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conductbut i have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent
my courage rises while i write
it is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble
i have already met with such success in two applications for pardon that i may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offenceyou must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when i first arrived at randalls you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards
this was the fact
my right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment is another question
i shall not discuss it here
for my temptation to think it a right i refer every caviller to a brick house sashed windows below and casements above in highbury
i dared not address her openly my difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well known to require definition and i was fortunate enough to prevail before we parted at weymouth and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagementhad she refused i should have gone madbut you will be ready to say what was your hope in doing thiswhat did you look forward toto any thing every thingto time chance circumstance slow effects sudden bursts perseverance and weariness health and sickness
every possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence
if you need farther explanation i have the honour my dear madam of being your husbands son and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value ofsee me then under these circumstances arriving on my first visit to randallsand here i am conscious of wrong for that visit might have been sooner paid
you will look back and see that i did not come till miss fairfax was in highbury and as you were the person slighted you will forgive me instantly but i must work on my fathers compassion by reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house so long i lost the blessing of knowing you
my behaviour during the very happy fortnight which i spent with you did not i hope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point
and now i come to the principal the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety or requires very solicitous explanation
with the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliationa few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable tomy behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it oughtin order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately throwni cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible objectbut i am sure you will believe the declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go onamiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much my conviction as my wishshe received my attentions with an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me
we seemed to understand each other
from our relative situation those attentions were her due and were felt to be sowhether miss woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight i cannot saywhen i called to take leave of her i remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth and i then fancied she was not without suspicion but i have no doubt of her having since detected me at least in some degreeshe may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must have penetrated a part
i cannot doubt it
you will find whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints that it did not take her wholly by surprize
she frequently gave me hints of it
i remember her telling me at the ball that i owed mrs elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfaxi hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss
while you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse i could deserve nothing from either
acquit me here and procure for me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that said emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myselfwhatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have now a key to
my heart was in highbury and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion
if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right accountof the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given herthe delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to
you will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourselfno description can describe her
she must tell you herself what she isyet not by word for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own meritsince i began this letter which will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from hershe gives a good account of her own health but as she never complains i dare not depend
i want to have your opinion of her looks
i know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit
perhaps it is paid already
let me hear from you without delay i am impatient for a thousand particulars
remember how few minutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state and i am not much better yet still insane either from happiness or misery
when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with of her excellence and patience and my uncles generosity i am mad with joy but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her and how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger
if i could but see her againbut i must not propose it yet
my uncle has been too good for me to encroachi must still add to this long letter
you have not heard all that you ought to hear
i could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness and in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out needs explanation for though the event of the th ult as you will conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects i should not have presumed on such early measures but from the very particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose
i should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinementbut i had no choice
the hasty engagement she had entered into with that womanhere my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly to recollect and compose myselfi have been walking over the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to beit is in fact a most mortifying retrospect for me
i behaved shamefully
and here i can admit that my manners to miss w in being unpleasant to miss f were highly blameable
she disapproved them which ought to have been enoughmy plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficientshe was displeased i thought unreasonably so i thought her on a thousand occasions unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious i thought her even cold
but she was always right
if i had followed her judgment and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have escaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever knownwe quarrelled do you remember the morning spent at donwellthere every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis
i was late i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it
she absolutely refused to allow me which i then thought most unreasonable
now however i see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion
while i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution uselesshad we been met walking together between donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspectedi was mad enough however to resenti doubted her affection
i doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by such conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her and such apparent devotion to miss w as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to mein short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side abominable on mine and i returned the same evening to richmond though i might have staid with you till the next morning merely because i would be as angry with her as possible
even then i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time but i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went away determined that she should make the first advancesi shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party
had you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again
its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced as soon as she found i was really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that officious mrs elton the whole system of whose treatment of her by the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred
i must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself but otherwise i should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has knownjane indeedyou will observe that i have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name even to you
think then what i must have endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of imaginary superiority
have patience with me i shall soon have doneshe closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet againshe felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved itthis letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunts death
i answered it within an hour but from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day was locked up in my writingdesk and i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines to satisfy her remained without any uneasinessi was rather disappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily but i made excuses for her and was too busy andmay i addtoo cheerful in my views to be captiouswe removed to windsor and two days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters all returnedand a few lines at the same time by the post stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last and adding that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible she now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested that if i could not directly command hers so as to send them to highbury within a week i would forward them after that period to her at in short the full direction to mr smallridges near bristol stared me in the face
i knew the name the place i knew all about it and instantly saw what she had been doing
it was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which i knew her to possess and the secrecy she had maintained as to any such design in her former letter was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy
for the world would not she have seemed to threaten meimagine the shock imagine how till i had actually detected my own blunder i raved at the blunders of the postwhat was to be doneone thing onlyi must speak to my uncle
without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to againi spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened away his pride and he was earlier than i could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man
with a deep sigh that he wished i might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had donei felt that it would be of a different sortare you disposed to pity me for what i must have suffered in opening the cause to him for my suspense while all was at stakeno do not pity me till i reached highbury and saw how ill i had made her
do not pity me till i saw her wan sick looksi reached highbury at the time of day when from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour i was certain of a good chance of finding her alonei was not disappointed and at last i was not disappointed either in the object of my journey
a great deal of very reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away
but it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moments uneasiness can ever occur between us again
now my dear madam i will release you but i could not conclude before
a thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards herif you think me in a way to be happier than i deserve i am quite of your opinionmiss w calls me the child of good fortune
i hope she is rightin one respect my good fortune is undoubted that of being able to subscribe myself  your obliged and affectionate son  f c weston churchill
this letter must make its way to emmas feelings
she was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that mrs weston foretold
as soon as she came to her own name it was irresistible every line relating to herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable and when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself by the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment
she never stopt till she had gone through the whole and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong yet he had been less wrong than she had supposedand he had suffered and was very sorryand he was so grateful to mrs weston and so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself that there was no being severe and could he have entered the room she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever
she thought so well of the letter that when mr knightley came again she desired him to read it
she was sure of mrs westons wishing it to be communicated especially to one who like mr knightley had seen so much to blame in his conduct
i shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long
i will take it home with me at night  but that would not do
mr weston was to call in the evening and she must return it by him
i would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems a matter of justice it shall be done  he beganstopping however almost directly to say had i been offered the sight of one of this gentlemans letters to his motherinlaw a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference  he proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then with a smile observed humph
a fine complimentary opening but it is his way
one mans style must not be the rule of anothers
we will not be severe  it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud as i read
by doing it i shall feel that i am near you
it will not be so great a loss of time but if you dislike it  not at all
i should wish it  mr knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity
he trifles here said he as to the temptation
he knows he is wrong and has nothing rational to urgebadhe ought not to have formed the engagementhis fathers dispositionhe is unjust however to his father
mr westons sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions but mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain itvery true he did not come till miss fairfax was here  and i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would
you pass it over very handsomelybut you were perfectly right  i was not quite impartial in my judgment emmabut yet i thinkhad you not been in the casei should still have distrusted him  when he came to miss woodhouse he was obliged to read the whole of it aloudall that related to her with a smile a look a shake of the head a word or two of assent or disapprobation or merely of love as the subject required concluding however seriously and after steady reflection thus  very badthough it might have been worseplaying a most dangerous game
too much indebted to the event for his acquittalno judge of his own manners by youalways deceived in fact by his own wishes and regardless of little besides his own conveniencefancying you to have fathomed his secret
natural enoughhis own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in othersmystery finessehow they pervert the understanding
my emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other  emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on harriets account which she could not give any sincere explanation of
you had better go on said she
he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte
ah
that was the act of a very very young man one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure
a boyish scheme indeedi cannot comprehend a mans wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with and he did know that she would have prevented the instruments coming if she could  after this he made some progress without any pause
frank churchills confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing
i perfectly agree with you sirwas then his remark
you did behave very shamefully
you never wrote a truer line and having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct opposition to jane fairfaxs sense of right he made a fuller pause to say this is very badhe had induced her to place herself for his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarilyshe must have had much more to contend with in carrying on the correspondence than he could
he should have respected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers were all reasonable
we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment  emma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party and grew uncomfortable
her own behaviour had been so very improper
she was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look
it was all read however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving painno remembrance of box hill seemed to exist
there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons was his next observationhis feelings are naturalwhat
actually resolve to break with him entirelyshe felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to eachshe dissolved itwhat a view this gives of her sense of his behaviourwell he must be a most extraordinary  nay nay read onyou will find how very much he suffers  i hope he does replied mr knightley coolly and resuming the letter
smallridgewhat does this mean
what is all this  she had engaged to go as governess to mrs smallridges childrena dear friend of mrs eltonsa neighbour of maple grove and by the bye i wonder how mrs elton bears the disappointment  say nothing my dear emma while you oblige me to readnot even of mrs elton
only one page more
i shall soon have done
what a letter the man writes  i wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him  well there is feeling herehe does seem to have suffered in finding her illcertainly i can have no doubt of his being fond of her
dearer much dearer than ever i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliationhe is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousandshappier than i deserve come he knows himself there
miss woodhouse calls me the child of good fortunethose were miss woodhouses words were they and a fine endingand there is the letter
the child of good fortune
that was your name for him was it  you do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as i am but still you must at least i hope you must think the better of him for it
i hope it does him some service with you  yes certainly it does
he has had great faults faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves but still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax and will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly with her i am very ready to believe his character will improve and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants
and now let me talk to you of something else
i have another persons interest at present so much at heart that i cannot think any longer about frank churchill
ever since i left you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject  the subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english such as mr knightley used even to the woman he was in love with how to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the happiness of her father
emmas answer was ready at the first word
while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her
she could never quit him part only of this answer however was admitted
the impossibility of her quitting her father mr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to
he had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce mr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her fathers comfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded
mr woodhouse taken from hartfieldno he felt that it ought not to be attempted
but the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as her fathers happinessin other words his liferequired hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise
of their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own passing thoughts
like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her
she was sensible of all the affection it evinced
she felt that in quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with
she promised to think of it and advised him to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject
he had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration he had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning to have his thoughts to himself
ah
there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma
i am sure william larkins will not like it
you must get his consent before you ask mine  she promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme
it is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights as heirexpectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded
think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of mr knightleys marrying jane fairfax or any body else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt
this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfieldthe more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became
his evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase their mutual good to outweigh every drawback
such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before hersuch a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy
she would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield
the delightful family party which emma was securing for herself poor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from
she would be a loser in every way
emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment
in such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise but for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment
in time of course mr knightley would be forgotten that is supplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early
mr knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the curenot like mr elton
mr knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she could be in love with more than three men in one year
it was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting
their intercourse was painful enough by letter
how much worse had they been obliged to meet
harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of illusage and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separateit might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke
she had no difficulty in procuring isabellas invitation and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it without resorting to inventionthere was a tooth amiss
harriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist
mrs john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill health was a recommendation to herand though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet under her carewhen it was thus settled on her sisters side emma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadableharriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was to be conveyed in mr woodhouses carriageit was all arranged it was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square
now emma could indeed enjoy mr knightleys visits now she could talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by that sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her how much might at that moment and at a little distance be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself
the difference of harriet at mrs goddards or in london made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emmas sensations but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself
she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied
there was a communication before her one which she only could be competent to makethe confession of her engagement to her father but she would have nothing to do with it at presentshe had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs weston were safe and well
no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she lovedand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed timea fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind to crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers
she soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfaxshe ought to goand she was longing to see her the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill
it would be a secret satisfaction but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate
she wentshe had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had not been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspectedthe fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured of their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her nameshe heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor miss bates had before made so happily intelligibleno she heard nothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk upand a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly forward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficientemma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging
there was consciousness animation and warmth there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted she came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very feeling tone  this is most kind indeedmiss woodhouse it is impossible for me to expressi hope you will believeexcuse me for being so entirely without words  emma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words if the sound of mrs eltons voice from the sittingroom had not checked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest shake of the hand
mrs bates and mrs elton were together
miss bates was out which accounted for the previous tranquillity
emma could have wished mrs elton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience with every body and as mrs elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm
she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs eltons thoughts and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits it was being in miss fairfaxs confidence and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people
emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face and while paying her own compliments to mrs bates and appearing to attend to the good old ladys replies she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods  we can finish this some other time you know
you and i shall not want opportunities
and in fact you have heard all the essential already
i only wanted to prove to you that mrs s admits our apology and is not offended
you see how delightfully she writes
oh
she is a sweet creature
you would have doated on her had you gonebut not a word more
let us be discreetquite on our good behaviourhushyou remember those linesi forget the poem at this moment  for when a ladys in the case you know all other things give place   now i say my dear in our case for lady readmum
a word to the wisei am in a fine flow of spirits ant i
but i want to set your heart at ease as to mrs smy representation you see has quite appeased her  and again on emmas merely turning her head to look at mrs batess knitting she added in a half whisper  i mentioned no names you will observeoh
no cautious as a minister of state
i managed it extremely well  emma could not doubt
it was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion
when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs weston she found herself abruptly addressed with  do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovereddo not you think her cure does perry the highest credithere was a sideglance of great meaning at jane
upon my word perry has restored her in a wonderful short timeoh
if you had seen her as i did when she was at the worstand when mrs bates was saying something to emma whispered farther we do not say a word of any assistance that perry might have not a word of a certain young physician from windsoroh
no perry shall have all the credit  i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill
very pleasant party
but yet i think there was something wanting
things did not seemthat is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of someso it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken
however i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again
what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lastsit must be the same party you know quite the same party not one exception  soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed from doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing
thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindnessit is impossible to sayyes indeed i quite understanddearest janes prospectsthat is i do not meanbut she is charmingly recoveredhow is mr woodhousei am so gladquite out of my powersuch a happy little circle as you find us hereyes indeedcharming young manthat isso very friendly i mean good mr perrysuch attention to janeand from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcomeafter a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess mrs elton speaking louder said  yes here i am my good friend and here i have been so long that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise but the truth is that i am waiting for my lord and master
he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you  what
are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr eltonthat will be a favour indeed
for i know gentlemen do not like morning visits and mr eltons time is so engaged  upon my word it is miss bateshe really is engaged from morning to nightthere is no end of peoples coming to him on some pretence or otherthe magistrates and overseers and churchwardens are always wanting his opinion
they seem not able to do any thing without himupon my word mr e i often say rather you than ii do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument if i had half so many applicantsbad enough as it is for i absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degreei believe i have not played a bar this fortnighthowever he is coming i assure you yes indeed on purpose to wait on you all and putting up her hand to screen her words from emmaa congratulatory visit you knowoh
yes quite indispensable  miss bates looked about her so happily
he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultationmr
e is knightleys right hand  emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is mr elton gone on foot to donwellhe will have a hot walk  oh
no it is a meeting at the crown a regular meeting
weston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only of those who leadi fancy mr e and knightley have every thing their own way  have not you mistaken the day said emma
i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till tomorrowmr
knightley was at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday  oh
no the meeting is certainly today was the abrupt answer which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs eltons sidei do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish that ever was
we never heard of such things at maple grove  your parish there was small said jane
upon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject talked of  but it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard you speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge the only school and not more than fiveandtwenty children  ah
you clever creature thats very true
what a thinking brain you have
i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make if we could be shaken together
my liveliness and your solidity would produce perfectionnot that i presume to insinuate however that some people may not think you perfection alreadybut hushnot a word if you please  it seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words not to mrs elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw
the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look
mr elton made his appearance
his lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity
very pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an encumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to comebut you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with
you knew i should not stir till my lord and master appearedhere have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obediencefor who can say you know how soon it may be wanted  mr elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away
his civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering and the walk he had had for nothing
when i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found
very odd
very unaccountable
after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one  donwell cried his wifemy dear mr e you have not been to donwellyou mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown  no no thats tomorrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley today on that very accountsuch a dreadful broiling morningi went over the fields toospeaking in a tone of great illusage which made it so much the worse
and then not to find him at home
i assure you i am not at all pleased
and no apology left no message for me
the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expectedvery extraordinaryand nobody knew at all which way he was gone
perhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woodsmiss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightleycan you explain it  emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary indeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him
i cannot imagine said mrs elton feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world
the very last person whom one should expect to be forgottenmy dear mr e he must have left a message for you i am sure he mustnot even knightley could be so very eccentricand his servants forgot it
depend upon it that was the case and very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all i have often observed extremely awkward and remissi am sure i would not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration
and as for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeedshe promised wright a receipt and never sent it  i met william larkins continued mr elton as i got near the house and he told me i should not find his master at home but i did not believe himwilliam seemed rather out of humour
he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him
i have nothing to do with williams wants but it really is of very great importance that i should see knightley today and it becomes a matter therefore of very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk to no purpose  emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly
in all probability she was at this very time waited for there and mr knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards mr elton if not towards william larkins
she was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined to attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of to say  it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility
had you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been tempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more openly than might have been strictly correcti feel that i should certainly have been impertinent  oh cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composurethere would have been no danger
the danger would have been of my wearying you
you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest
indeed miss woodhouse speaking more collectedly with the consciousness which i have of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good opinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a degree as toi have not time for half that i could wish to say
i long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself
i feel it so very due
but unfortunatelyin short if your compassion does not stand my friend  oh
you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly and taking her hand
you owe me no apologies and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied so delighted even  you are very kind but i know what my manners were to youso cold and artificiali had always a part to actit was a life of deceiti know that i must have disgusted you  pray say no more
i feel that all the apologies should be on my side
let us forgive each other at once
we must do whatever is to be done quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there
i hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor  very  and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose youjust as i begin to know you  oh
as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet
i am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell  nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma smilingbut excuse me it must be thought of  the smile was returned as jane answered  you are very right it has been thought of
and i will own to you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living with mr churchill at enscombe it is settled
there must be three months at least of deep mourning but when they are over i imagine there will be nothing more to wait for  thank you thank youthis is just what i wanted to be assured ofoh
if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and opengoodbye goodbye       mrs westons friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her welldoing could be increased to emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl
she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston
she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabellas sons but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best
it would be a great comfort to mr weston as he grew olderand even mr weston might be growing older ten years henceto have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home and mrs westonno one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach should not have their powers in exercise again
she has had the advantage you know of practising on me she continuedlike la baronne dalmane on la comtesse dostalis in madame de genlis adelaide and theodore and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan  that is replied mr knightley she will indulge her even more than she did you and believe that she does not indulge her at all
it will be the only difference  poor child cried emma at that rate what will become of her  nothing very badthe fate of thousands
she will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older
i am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest emma
i who am owing all my happiness to you would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them  emma laughed and replied but i had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people
i doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it  do youi have no doubt
nature gave you understandingmiss taylor gave you principles
you must have done well
my interference was quite as likely to do harm as good
it was very natural for you to say what right has he to lecture meand i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner
i do not believe i did you any good
the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me
i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least  i am sure you were of use to me cried emma
i was very often influenced rightly by youoftener than i would own at the time
i am very sure you did me good
and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me except falling in love with her when she is thirteen  how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looksmr
knightley i am going to do soandso papa says i may or i have miss taylors leavesomething which you knew i did not approve
in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one  what an amiable creature i wasno wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance  mr
knightleyyou always called me mr
knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a soundand yet it is formal
i want you to call me something else but i do not know what  i remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits about ten years ago
i did it because i thought it would offend you but as you made no objection i never did it again  and cannot you call me george now  impossiblei never can call you any thing but mr
knightley i will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton by calling you mr kbut i will promise she added presently laughing and blushingi will promise to call you once by your christian name
i do not say when but perhaps you may guess wherein the building in which n takes m for better for worse  emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly folliesher wilful intimacy with harriet smith but it was too tender a subjectshe could not enter on itharriet was very seldom mentioned between them
this on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining
she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on isabellas letters
he might observe that it was so
the pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little inferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy
isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits which appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to be consulted but since that business had been over she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her beforeisabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children it would not have escaped her
emmas comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriets being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be a month at least
mr and mrs john knightley were to come down in august and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back
john does not even mention your friend said mr knightley
here is his answer if you like to see it  it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage
emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned
john enters like a brother into my happiness continued mr knightley but he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have likewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from making flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise
but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes  he writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read the letter
i honour his sincerity
it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already
had he said any thing to bear a different construction i should not have believed him  my emma he means no such thing
he only means  he and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two interrupted she with a sort of serious smilemuch less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject  emma my dear emma  oh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion
depend upon it he will be much farther from doing you justice
he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question all the merit on mine
i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at oncehis tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther  ah he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced as john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give to be happy together
i am amused by one part of johns letterdid you notice itwhere he says that my information did not take him wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind  if i understand your brother he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying
he had no idea of me
he seems perfectly unprepared for that  yes yesbut i am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings
what has he been judging byi am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at anotherbut it was so i suppose
i dare say there was a difference when i was staying with them the other day
i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual
i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now  the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons reception of it tried
as soon as mrs weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr woodhouses visits emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at randallsbut how to break it to her father at lastshe had bound herself to do it in such an hour of mr knightleys absence or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must have put it off but mr knightley was to come at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to makeshe was forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too
she must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself
she must not appear to think it a misfortunewith all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtainedwhich she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of allshe and mr knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that persons company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs weston best in the world
poor manit was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it
she was reminded more than once of having always said she would never marry and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of poor isabella and poor miss taylorbut it would not do
emma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs weston whose marriages taking them from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change but she was not going from hartfield she should be always there she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having mr knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the ideadid he not love mr knightley very muchhe would not deny that he did she was surewhom did he ever want to consult on business but mr knightleywho was so useful to him who so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist himwho so cheerful so attentive so attached to himwould not he like to have him always on the spotyes
that was all very true
mr knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see him every daybut they did see him every day as it waswhy could not they go on as they had done
mr woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome the idea was given time and continual repetition must do the restto emmas entreaties and assurances succeeded mr knightleys whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasionthey had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest approbation and mrs weston was ready on the first meeting to consider the subject in the most serviceable lightfirst as a settled and secondly as a good onewell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr woodhouses mindit was agreed upon as what was to be and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it he began to think that some time or otherin another year or two perhapsit might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place
mrs weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the eventshe had been extremely surprized never more so than when emma first opened the affair to her but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in urging him to the utmostshe had such a regard for mr knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it long agohow very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield
and who but mr knightley could know and bear with mr woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirablethe difficulty of disposing of poor mr woodhouse had been always felt in her husbands plans and her own for a marriage between frank and emma
how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impedimentless acknowledged by mr weston than by herselfbut even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by sayingthose matters will take care of themselves the young people will find a way but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future
it was all right all open all equal
no sacrifice on any side worth the name
it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself and without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it
mrs weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections as these was one of the happiest women in the world
if any thing could increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps
the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread and mr weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mindhe saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it
it is to be a secret i conclude said he
these matters are always a secret till it is found out that every body knows them
only let me be told when i may speak outi wonder whether jane has any suspicion  he went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on that point
he told her the news
was not she like a daughter his eldest daughterhe must tell her and miss bates being present it passed of course to mrs cole mrs perry and mrs elton immediately afterwards
it was no more than the principals were prepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking of themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle with great sagacity
in general it was a very well approved match
some might think him and others might think her the most in luck
one set might recommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements among their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious objection raised except in one habitation the vicaragethere the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction
mr elton cared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the young ladys pride would now be contented and supposed she had always meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point of living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than ibut mrs elton was very much discomposed indeedpoor knightley
poor fellowsad business for himshe was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualitieshow could he be so taken indid not think him at all in lovenot in the leastpoor knightleythere would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with himhow happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him
but that would be all over nowpoor fellowno more exploring parties to donwell made for her
oh
no there would be a mrs knightley to throw cold water on every thingextremely disagreeable
but she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other dayshocking plan living together
it would never do
she knew a family near maple grove who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter
time passed on
a few more tomorrows and the party from london would be arriving
it was an alarming change and emma was thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when mr knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by
after the first chat of pleasure he was silent and then in a graver tone began with  i have something to tell you emma some news  good or bad said she quickly looking up in his face
i do not know which it ought to be called  oh
good i am surei see it in your countenance
you are trying not to smile  i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it  indeed
but why soi can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too  there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not think alike he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face
does nothing occur to youdo not you recollectharriet smith  her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what
have you heard from her yourself this morning cried he
you have i believe and know the whole  no i have not i know nothing pray tell me  you are prepared for the worst i seeand very bad it is
harriet smith marries robert martin  emma gave a start which did not seem like being preparedand her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible but her lips were closed
it is so indeed continued mr knightley i have it from robert martin himself
he left me not half an hour ago  she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement
you like it my emma as little as i fearedi wish our opinions were the same
but in time they will
time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject  you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself
it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it
it seems an impossibilityyou cannot mean to say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin
you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her againyet
you only mean that he intends it  i mean that he has done it answered mr knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted  good god she criedwellthen having recourse to her workbasket in excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing she added well now tell me every thing make this intelligible to me
how where whenlet me know it all
i never was more surprizedbut it does not make me unhappy i assure youhowhow has it been possible  it is a very simple story
he went to town on business three days ago and i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting to send to johnhe delivered these papers to john at his chambers and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astleys
they were going to take the two eldest boys to astleys
the party was to be our brother and sister henry johnand miss smith
my friend robert could not resist
they called for him in their way were all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with them the next daywhich he didand in the course of that visit as i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet and certainly did not speak in vainshe made him by her acceptance as happy even as he is deserving
he came down by yesterdays coach and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report his proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own
this is all that i can relate of the how where and when
your friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see hershe will give you all the minute particulars which only womans language can make interestingin our communications we deal only in the greathowever i must say that robert martins heart seemed for him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention without its being much to the purpose that on quitting their box at astleys my brother took charge of mrs john knightley and little john and he followed with miss smith and henry and that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith rather uneasy  he stoppedemma dared not attempt any immediate reply
to speak she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness
she must wait a moment or he would think her mad
her silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while he added  emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected
his situation is an evilbut you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more
his good sense and good principles would delight youas far as the man is concerned you could not wish your friend in better hands
his rank in society i would alter if i could which is saying a great deal i assure you emmayou laugh at me about william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin  he wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself not to smile too broadlyshe didcheerfully answering  you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match
i think harriet is doing extremely well
her connexions may be worse than his
in respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are
i have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize
you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me
how peculiarly unprepared i wasfor i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before  you ought to know your friend best replied mr knightley but i should say she was a goodtempered softhearted girl not likely to be very very determined against any young man who told her he loved her  emma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word i believe you know her quite as well as i dobut mr knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him
i could suppose she might in timebut can she alreadydid not you misunderstand himyou were both talking of other things of business shows of cattle or new drillsand might not you in the confusion of so many subjects mistake himit was not harriets hand that he was certain ofit was the dimensions of some famous ox  the contrast between the countenance and air of mr knightley and robert martin was at this moment so strong to emmas feelings and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriets side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis no i hope i know better than to think of robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature
it could not be otherwise
do you dare say this cried mr knightley
do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking ofwhat do you deserve  oh
i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer
are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which mr martin and harriet now are  i am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he told me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity nothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you a proof that it must be so
he asked my opinion as to what he was now to do
he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends
could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard
i assured him that i could not
then he said he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day  i am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles and most sincerely wish them happy  you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before  i hope sofor at that time i was a fool  and i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all harriets good qualities
i have taken some pains for your sake and for robert martins sake whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her
i have often talked to her a good deal
you must have seen that i did
sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martins cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic lifemuch of this i have no doubt she may thank you for  me cried emma shaking her headah
poor harriet  she checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved
their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father
she was not sorry
she wanted to be alone
her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be collected
she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits and till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed and reflected she could be fit for nothing rational
her fathers business was to announce jamess being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing
the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined
the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of harriets welfare she was really in danger of becoming too happy for securitywhat had she to wish for
nothing but to grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own
nothing but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future
serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst of them
she must laugh at such a close
such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back
such a heartsuch a harriet
now there would be pleasure in her returningevery thing would be a pleasure
it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin
high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr knightley would soon be over
the disguise equivocation mystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over
she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty
in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father not always listening but always agreeing to what he said and whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day or poor mrs weston would be disappointed
they arrivedmrs
weston was alone in the drawingroombut hardly had they been told of the baby and mr woodhouse received the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse was caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window
it is frank and miss fairfax said mrs weston
i was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning
he stays till tomorrow and miss fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with usthey are coming in i hope  in half a minute they were in the room
emma was extremely glad to see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of embarrassing recollections on each side
they met readily and smiling but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure
when mr weston joined the party however and when the baby was fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animationor of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her and say  i have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs westons letters
i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon
i hope you do not retract what you then said  no indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least
i am particularly glad to see and shake hands with youand to give you joy in person  he thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness
is not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane
better than she ever used to doyou see how my father and mrs weston doat upon her  but his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes after mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named the name of dixonemma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing
i can never think of it she cried without extreme shame  the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be
but is it possible that you had no suspicioni mean of late
early i know you had none  i never had the smallest i assure you  that appears quite wonderful
i was once very nearand i wish i hadit would have been better
but though i was always doing wrong things they were very bad wrong things and such as did me no serviceit would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing  it is not now worth a regret said emma
i have some hope resumed he of my uncles being persuaded to pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her
when the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london and continue there i trust till we may carry her northwardbut now i am at such a distance from heris not it hard miss woodhousetill this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation
do not you pity me  emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay thought he cried  ah
by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for the momenti hope mr knightley is well he pausedshe coloured and laughedi know you saw my letter and think you may remember my wish in your favour
let me return your congratulationsi assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfactionhe is a man whom i cannot presume to praise  emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own jane and his next words were  did you ever see such a skinsuch smoothness
such delicacyand yet without being actually fairone cannot call her fair
it is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eyelashes and haira most distinguishing complexion
so peculiarly the lady in itjust colour enough for beauty  i have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do not i remember the time when you found fault with her for being so palewhen we first began to talk of herhave you quite forgotten  oh
nowhat an impudent dog i washow could i dare  but he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could not help saying  i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us alli am sure you hadi am sure it was a consolation to you  oh
no no nohow can you suspect me of such a thing
i was the most miserable wretch  not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth
i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all inperhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation
i think there is a little likeness between us  he bowed
if not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of true sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own  true true he answered warmly
no not true on your side
you can have no superior but most true on mineshe is a complete angel
look at her
is not she an angel in every gesture
observe the turn of her throat
observe her eyes as she is looking up at my fatheryou will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my aunts jewels
they are to be new set
i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head
will not it be beautiful in her dark hair  very beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out  how delighted i am to see you again
and to see you in such excellent looksi would not have missed this meeting for the world
i should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come  the others had been talking of the child mrs weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under the evening before from the infants appearing not quite well
she believed she had been foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr perry
perhaps she ought to be ashamed but mr weston had been almost as uneasy as herselfin ten minutes however the child had been perfectly well again
this was her history and particularly interesting it was to mr woodhouse who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry and only regretted that she had not done it
she should always send for perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered were it only for a moment
she could not be too soon alarmed nor send for perry too often
it was a pity perhaps that he had not come last night for though the child seemed well now very well considering it would probably have been better if perry had seen it  frank churchill caught the name
perry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss fairfaxs eye
my friend mr perry
what are they saying about mr perryhas he been here this morningand how does he travel nowhas he set up his carriage  emma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined in the laugh it was evident from janes countenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf
such an extraordinary dream of mine he cried
i can never think of it without laughingshe hears us she hears us miss woodhouse
i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown
look at her
do not you see that at this instant the very passage of her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eyethat the whole blunder is spread before herthat she can attend to nothing else though pretending to listen to the others  jane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious low yet steady voice  how you can bear such recollections is astonishing to methey will sometimes obtrudebut how you can court them  he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but emmas feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on leaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of mr knightleys high superiority of character
the happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced
if emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr knightley and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty
a very few days brought the party from london and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet than she became perfectly satisfiedunaccountable as it wasthat robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr knightley and was now forming all her views of happiness
harriet was a little distresseddid look a little foolish at first but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and selfdeceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to her friends approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulationsharriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astleys and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight
but what did such particulars explainthe fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had always liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had been irresistiblebeyond this it must ever be unintelligible to emma
the event however was most joyful and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking soharriets parentage became known
she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent enough to have always wished for concealmentsuch was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch forit was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many a gentleman but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr knightleyor for the churchillsor even for mr eltonthe stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth would have been a stain indeed
no objection was raised on the fathers side the young man was treated liberally it was all as it should be and as emma became acquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend
she had no doubt of harriets happiness with any goodtempered man but with him and in the home he offered there would be the hope of more of security stability and improvement
she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself retired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness
she would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out
she would be respectable and happy and emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a manor if not quite the luckiest to yield only to herself
harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins was less and less at hartfield which was not to be regrettedthe intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner
before the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction as no remembrances even connected with mr elton as he stood before them could impairperhaps indeed at that time she scarcely saw mr elton but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herselfrobert martin and harriet smith the latest couple engaged of the three were the first to be married
jane fairfax had already quitted highbury and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbellsthe mr churchills were also in town and they were only waiting for november
the intermediate month was the one fixed on as far as they dared by emma and mr knightleythey had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield to allow them the fortnights absence in a tour to the seaside which was the planjohn and isabella and every other friend were agreed in approving it
but mr woodhousehow was mr woodhouse to be induced to consenthe who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event
when first sounded on the subject he was so miserable that they were almost hopelessa second allusion indeed gave less painhe began to think it was to be and that he could not prevent ita very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation
still however he was not happy
nay he appeared so much otherwise that his daughters courage failed
she could not bear to see him suffering to know him fancying himself neglected and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the mr knightleys that when once the event were over his distress would be soon over too she hesitatedshe could not proceed
in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden illumination of mr woodhouses mind or any wonderful change of his nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another waymrs
westons poultryhouse was robbed one night of all her turkeysevidently by the ingenuity of man
other poultryyards in the neighbourhood also sufferedpilfering was housebreaking to mr woodhouses fearshe was very uneasy and but for the sense of his soninlaws protection would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life
the strength resolution and presence of mind of the mr knightleys commanded his fullest dependence
while either of them protected him and his hartfield was safebut mr john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november
the result of this distress was that with a much more voluntary cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment she was able to fix her weddingdayand mr elton was called on within a month from the marriage of mr and mrs robert martin to join the hands of mr knightley and miss woodhouse
the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have no taste for finery or parade and mrs elton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very inferior to her ownvery little white satin very few lace veils a most pitiful businessselina would stare when she heard of itbut in spite of these deficiencies the wishes the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union
finis
    persuasion  by jane austen     contents        sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed
this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened  elliot of kellynch hall
walter elliot born march   married july   elizabeth daughter of james stevenson esq
of south park in the county of gloucester by which lady who died  he has issue elizabeth born june   anne born august   a stillborn son november   mary born november    precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printers hands but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of himself and his family these words after the date of marys birthmarried december   charles son and heir of charles musgrove esq
of uppercross in the county of somerset and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife
then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff representing a borough in three successive parliaments exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with the arms and mottoprincipal seat kellynch hall in the county of somerset and sir walters handwriting again in this finale  heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of the second sir walter  vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliots character vanity of person and of situation
he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at fiftyfour was still a very fine man
few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society
he considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion
his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own
lady elliot had been an excellent woman sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot had never required indulgence afterwardsshe had humoured or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit themthree girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father
she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters
this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance
thirteen years had passed away since lady elliots death and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower the other a widow
that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not but sir walters continuing in singleness requires explanation
be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake
for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing which he had not been very much tempted to do
elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mothers rights and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself her influence had always been great and they had gone on together most happily
his two other children were of very inferior value
mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give wayshe was only anne
to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued goddaughter favourite and friend
lady russell loved them all but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again
a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height her father had found little to admire in her so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin to excite his esteem
he had never indulged much hope he had now none of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work
all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably
it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twentynine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost
it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing
anne haggard mary coarse every face in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crows foot about lady russells temples had long been a distress to him
elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment
thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and directing with a selfpossession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was
for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawingrooms and diningrooms in the country
thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world
she had the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being nineandtwenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronetblood within the next twelvemonth or two
then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth but now she liked it not
always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes and pushed it away
she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of
the heir presumptive the very william walter elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported by her father had disappointed her
she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be in the event of her having no brother the future baronet meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should
he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliots death sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it making allowance for the modest drawingback of youth and in one of their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom mr elliot had been forced into the introduction
he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour was confirmed
he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came
the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come and the next tidings were that he was married
instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth
sir walter had resented it
as the head of the house he felt that he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together he observed once at tattersalls and twice in the lobby of the house of commons his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded
mr elliot had attempted no apology and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family as sir walter considered him unworthy of it all acquaintance between them had ceased
this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man for himself and still more for being her fathers heir and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter elliots eldest daughter
there was not a baronet from a to z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal
yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was at this present time the summer of  wearing black ribbons for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again
the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own
this could not be pardoned
such were elizabeth elliots sentiments and sensations such the cares to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life such the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence in one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy
but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these
her father was growing distressed for money
she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts
the kellynch property was good but not equal to sir walters apprehension of the state required in its possessor
while lady elliot lived there had been method moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income but with her had died all such rightmindedness and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it
it had not been possible for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot was imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially from his daughter
he had given her some hints of it the last spring in town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench
does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing the drawingroom to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne as had been the usual yearly custom
but these measures however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards
elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy
she felt herself illused and unfortunate as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne
there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference
he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power but he would never condescend to sell
no he would never disgrace his name so far
the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire as he had received it
their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in the neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride
mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted
lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it much serious consideration
she was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles
she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour but she was as desirous of saving sir walters feelings as solicitous for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be
she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of goodbreeding
she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking rational and consistentbut she had prejudices on the side of ancestry she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them
herself the widow of only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties
they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt
but she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and elizabeth
she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question
she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to sir walter
every emendation of annes had been on the side of honesty against importance
she wanted more vigorous measures a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity
if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell looking over her paper much may be done
if he will adopt these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle
what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families have done or ought to do
there will be nothing singular in his case and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering as it always does of our conduct
i have great hope of prevailing
we must be serious and decided for after all the person who has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father there is still more due to the character of an honest man  this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him
she considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it
she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty
she rated lady russells influence highly and as to the severe degree of selfdenial which her own conscience prompted she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete than to half a reformation
her knowledge of her father and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on through the whole list of lady russells too gentle reductions
how annes more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence
lady russells had no success at all could not be put up with were not to be borne
what
every comfort of life knocked off
journeys london servants horses tablecontractions and restrictions every where
to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman
no he would sooner quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms  quit kellynch hall the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walters retrenching and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode
since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side
it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support
in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household  sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go was settled and the first outline of this important change made out
there had been three alternatives london bath or another house in the country
all annes wishes had been for the latter
a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russells society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition
but the usual fate of anne attended her in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on
she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her and bath was to be her home
sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred
it was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament he might there be important at comparatively little expense
two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russells spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there
lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear annes known wishes
it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood
anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walters feelings they must have been dreadful
and with regard to annes dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising first from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there after her mothers death and secondly from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself
lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friends health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good
anne had been too little from home too little seen
her spirits were not high
a larger society would improve them
she wanted her to be more known
the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning
he was not only to quit his home but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude which stronger heads than sir walters have found too much
kellynch hall was to be let
this however was a profound secret not to be breathed beyond their own circle
sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house
mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again
sir walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour that he would let it at all
how quick come the reasons for approving what we like
lady russell had another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter and his family were to remove from the country
elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted
it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her fathers house with the additional burden of two children
she was a clever young woman who understood the art of pleasingthe art of pleasing at least at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place could hint of caution and reserve
lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth and seemed to love her rather because she would love her than because elizabeth deserved it
she had never received from her more than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry against previous inclination
she had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience but always in vain elizabeth would go her own way and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility
from situation mrs clay was in lady russells estimate a very unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliots reach was therefore an object of firstrate importance
i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper that the present juncture is much in our favour
this peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore
they will be all wanting a home
could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants
many a noble fortune has been made during the war
if a rich admiral were to come in our way sir walter  he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter thats all i have to remark
a prize indeed would kellynch hall be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken ever so many before hey shepherd  mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added  i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with
i have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with
therefore sir walter what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd might conceal any familymatters that i chose for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you the trouble of replying  sir walter only nodded
but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed sarcastically  there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description  they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune said mrs clay for mrs clay was present her father had driven her over nothing being of so much use to mrs clays health as a drive to kellynch but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant
i have known a good deal of the profession and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful in all their ways
these valuable pictures of yours sir walter if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe
everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of
the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now
you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected  as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it
i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant
the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasuregrounds is another thing
i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden
i am very little disposed to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour i assure you be he sailor or soldier  after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say  in all these cases there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant
your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands
depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights
i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own as john shepherd will be for him  here anne spoke  the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give
sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow  very true very true
what miss anne says is very true was mr shepherds rejoinder and oh
certainly was his daughters but sir walters remark was soon afterwards  the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it  indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise
yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds of objection to it
first as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly as it cuts up a mans youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old sooner than any other man
i have observed it all my life
a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line
one day last spring in town i was in company with two men striking instances of what i am talking of lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorablelooking personage you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side and nothing but a dab of powder at top
in the name of heaven who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near sir basil morley
old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin
what do you take his age to be sixty said i or perhaps sixtytwo forty replied sir basil forty and no more picture to yourselves my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin
i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a seafaring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen
it is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwins age  nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed
have a little mercy on the poor men
we are not all born to be handsome
the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth
but then is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other
soldiers in active service are not at all better off and even in the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind if not of the body which seldom leaves a mans looks to the natural effect of time
the lawyer plods quite careworn the physician is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even the clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergymanand even the clergyman you know is obliged to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere
in fact as i have long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours following their own pursuits and living on their own property without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young  it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walters good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent
by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him that accidentally hearingit was just as he had foretold mr shepherd observed sir walters concerns could not be kept a secretaccidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let and understanding his mr shepherds connection with the owner he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant
and who is admiral croft was sir walters cold suspicious inquiry
mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentlemans family and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed added  he is a rear admiral of the white
he was in the trafalgar action and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there i believe several years  then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery  mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale hearty welllooking man a little weatherbeaten to be sure but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a readyfurnished house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman
mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all the circumstances of the admirals family which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant
he was a married man and without children the very state to be wished for
a house was never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady as where there were many children
a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture in the world
he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over
and a very wellspoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be continued he asked more questions about the house and terms and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once she told me so herself sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at monkford
bless me
what was his name
at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately
penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at monkford mrs crofts brother  but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not hear the appeal
i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent  bless me
how very odd
i shall forget my own name soon i suppose
a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmers man breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement submitted to an amicable compromise
very odd indeed  after waiting another moment  you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne
mr shepherd was all gratitude
wentworth was the very name
mr wentworth was the very man
he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back for two or three years
came there about the year  i take it
you remember him i am sure  wentworth
oh
aymr wentworth the curate of monkford
you misled me by the term gentleman
i thought you were speaking of some man of property mr wentworth was nobody i remember quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family
one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common  as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in the secret of sir walters estimate of the dues of a tenant
it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen
sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer
so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing in the admirals situation in life which was just high enough and not too high
i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation
an admiral speaks his own consequence and at the same time can never make a baronet look small
in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever have the precedence
nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her
mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said with a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps may be walking here       he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire in the summer of  and having no parent living found a home for half a year at monkford
he was at that time a remarkably fine young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste and feeling
half the sum of attraction on either side might have been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail
they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and deeply in love
it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted
a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one
troubles soon arose
sir walter on being applied to without actually withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter
he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one
anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of
anne elliot so young known to so few to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious youthkilling dependence
it must not be if by any fair interference of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mothers love and mothers rights it would be prevented
captain wentworth had no fortune
he had been lucky in his profession but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing
but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted
he had always been lucky he knew he should be so still
such confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently
his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her
she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil
it only added a dangerous character to himself
he was brilliant he was headstrong
lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror
she deprecated the connexion in every light
such opposition as these feelings produced was more than anne could combat
young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her fathers illwill though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain
she was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing indiscreet improper hardly capable of success and not deserving it
but it was not a merely selfish caution under which she acted in putting an end to it
had she not imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own she could hardly have given him up
the belief of being prudent and selfdenying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment
he had left the country in consequence
a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance but not with a few months ended annes share of suffering from it
her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect
more than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture or in any novelty or enlargement of society
no one had ever come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory
no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them
she had been solicited when about twoandtwenty to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man whose landed property and general importance were second in that country only to sir walters and of good character and appearance and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twentytwo so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her fathers house and settled so permanently near herself
but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for annes being tempted by some man of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits
they knew not each others opinion either its constancy or its change on the one leading point of annes conduct for the subject was never alluded to but anne at sevenandtwenty thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen
she did not blame lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good
she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on
all his sanguine expectations all his confidence had been justified
his genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path
he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ and all that he had told her would follow had taken place
he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune
she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married
how eloquent could anne elliot have been
how eloquent at least were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful confidence in futurity against that overanxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust providence
she had been forced into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning
with all these circumstances recollections and feelings she could not hear that captain wentworths sister was likely to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea
she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil
she was assisted however by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it
she could do justice to the superiority of lady russells motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral crofts really taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his the brother only with whom he had been residing had received any information of their shortlived engagement
that brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creatures having heard of it from him
the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards
with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness
on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs crofts seeing kellynch hall anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russells and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them
this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory and decided the whole business at once
each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality on the admirals side as could not but influence sir walter who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by mr shepherds assurances of his being known by report to the admiral as a model of good breeding
the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherds clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth  sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be the bestlooking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton
the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be no harm in himreciprocal compliments which would have been esteemed about equal
the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement
lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain
it would be most right and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others
something occurred however to give her a different duty
mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing that she should not have a days health all the autumn entreated or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her instead of going to bath
i cannot possibly do without anne was marys reasoning and elizabeths reply was then i am sure anne had better stay for nobody will want her in bath  to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay
this invitation of marys removed all lady russells difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge
so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her which was mrs clays being engaged to go to bath with sir walter and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her
lady russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne in mrs clays being of so much use while anne could be of none was a very sore aggravation
anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell
with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her fathers character she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible
she did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind
mrs clay had freckles and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young and certainly altogether welllooking and possessed in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been
anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister
she had little hope of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought have reason to reproach her for giving no warning
she spoke and seemed only to offend
elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly answered for each partys perfectly knowing their situation
mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people
and as to my father i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected now
if mrs clay were a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might be rendered unhappy
but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety
one would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes though i know you must fifty times
that tooth of hers and those freckles
freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him
i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few but he abominates them
you must have heard him notice mrs clays freckles  there is hardly any personal defect replied anne which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to  i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never alter plain ones
however at any rate as i have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me  anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless of doing good
elizabeth though resenting the suspicion might yet be made observant by it
the last office of the four carriagehorses was to draw sir walter miss elliot and mrs clay to bath
the party drove off in very good spirits sir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity to the lodge where she was to spend the first week
her friend was not in better spirits than herself
lady russell felt this breakup of the family exceedingly
their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit
it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne
accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage of lady russells journey
uppercross was a moderatesized village which a few years back had been completely in the old english style containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a peartree trained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire it had received the improvement of a farmhouse elevated into a cottage for his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch the travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on
here anne had often been staying
she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch
the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each others house at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course
though better endowed than the elder sister mary had not annes understanding nor temper
while well and happy and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits but any indisposition sunk her completely
she had no resources for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot selfimportance was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and illused
in person she was inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the dignity of being a fine girl she was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawingroom the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two children and on annes appearing greeted her with  so you are come at last
i began to think i should never see you
i am so ill i can hardly speak
i have not seen a creature the whole morning  i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne
you sent me such a good account of yourself on thursday  yes i made the best of it i always do but i was very far from well at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life as i have been all this morning very unfit to be left alone i am sure
suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way and not able to ring the bell
so lady russell would not get out
i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer  anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband
oh
charles is out shooting
i have not seen him since seven oclock
he would go though i told him how ill i was
he said he should not stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one
i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning  you have had your little boys with you  yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good
little charles does not mind a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad  well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully
you know i always cure you when i come
how are your neighbours at the great house  i can give you no account of them
i have not seen one of them today except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was not one of them have been near me
it did not happen to suit the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves out of their way  you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone
it is early  i never want them i assure you
they talk and laugh a great deal too much for me
oh
anne i am so very unwell
it was quite unkind of you not to come on thursday  my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself
you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have left kellynch sooner  dear me
what can you possibly have to do  a great many things i assure you
more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some
i have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my fathers books and pictures
i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeths plants are for lady russell
i have had all my own little concerns to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of takeleave
i was told that they wished it
but all these things took up a great deal of time  oh
well and after a moments pause but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday  did you go then
i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party  oh yes
i went
i was very well yesterday nothing at all the matter with me till this morning
it would have been strange if i had not gone  i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party  nothing remarkable
one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of ones own
mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were so crowded
they are both so very large and take up so much room and mr musgrove always sits forward
so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louisa and i think it very likely that my illness today may be owing to it  a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on annes side produced nearly a cure on marys
she could soon sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinnertime
then forgetting to think of it she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough to propose a little walk
where shall we go said she when they were ready
i suppose you will not like to call at the great house before they have been to see you  i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne
i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know so well as mrs and the miss musgroves  oh
but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible
they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister
however we may as well go and sit with them a little while and when we have that over we can enjoy our walk  anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it
to the great house accordingly they went to sit the full half hour in the oldfashioned square parlour with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand pianoforte and a harp flowerstands and little tables placed in every direction
oh
could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness
the portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment
the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration perhaps of improvement
the father and mother were in the old english style and the young people in the new
mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable not much educated and not at all elegant
their children had more modern minds and manners
there was a numerous family but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry
their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad
anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together that goodhumoured mutual affection of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters
they were received with great cordiality
nothing seemed amiss on the side of the great house family which was generally as anne very well knew the least to blame
the half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both the miss musgroves at marys particular invitation
anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea
she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath do you think they will settle in and this without much waiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of i hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa if we do go we must be in a good situation none of your queen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary ofupon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away to be happy at bath  she could only resolve to avoid such selfdelusion in future and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell
the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy their own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping neighbours dress dancing and music
she acknowledged it to be very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into
with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible
she had no dread of these two months
mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort
she was always on friendly terms with her brotherinlaw and in the children who loved her nearly as well and respected her a great deal more than their mother she had an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion
charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits
as it was he did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise trifled away without benefit from books or anything else
he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by his wifes occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to annes admiration and upon the whole though there was very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass for a happy couple
they were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made he always contended for his fathers having many other uses for his money and a right to spend it as he liked
as to the management of their children his theory was much better than his wifes and his practice not so bad
i could manage them very well if it were not for marys interference was what anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in but when listening in turn to marys reproach of charles spoils the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had the smallest temptation to say very true  one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house
known to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable
i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill was charless language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think there was anything the matter with me
i am sure anne if you would you might persuade him that i really am very illa great deal worse than i ever own  marys declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with anne to say oh
miss anne i cannot help wishing mrs charles had a little of your method with those children
they are quite different creatures with you
but to be sure in general they are so spoilt
it is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them
they are as fine healthy children as ever were seen poor little dears
without partiality but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated
bless me
how troublesome they are sometimes
i assure you miss anne it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should
i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment dont do this and dont do that or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them  she had this communication moreover from mary
mrs musgrove thinks all her servants so steady that it would be high treason to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration that her upper housemaid and laundrymaid instead of being in their business are gadding about the village all day long
i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them
if jemima were not the trustiest steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them and on mrs musgroves side it was i make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughterinlaws concerns for i know it would not do but i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charless nurserymaid i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from my own knowledge i can declare she is such a finedressing lady that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near
mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss you need not be afraid of mentioning it  again it was marys complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place
and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma
nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it
it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world but i know it is taken notice of by many persons  how was anne to set all these matters to rights
she could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sisters benefit
in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well
her own spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed three miles from kellynch marys ailments lessened by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage
it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible for they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of mr and mrs musgroves respectable forms in the usual places or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters
she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others as she was well aware
she knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation
excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste
in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world and mr and mrs musgroves fond partiality for their own daughters performance and total indifference to any other persons gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification for her own
the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company
the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited by everybody and had more dinnerparties and more callers more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family
they were more completely popular
the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally in an unpremeditated little ball
there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures they would come at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else and often drew this complimentwell done miss anne
very well done indeed
lord bless me
how those little fingers of yours fly about  so passed the first three weeks
michaelmas came and now annes heart must be in kellynch again
a beloved home made over to others all the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects beginning to own other eyes and other limbs
she could not think of much else on the th of september and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this the day the crofts were to come to kellynch
i am glad i did not think of it before
how low it makes me  the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were to be visited
mary deplored the necessity for herself
nobody knew how much she should suffer
she should put it off as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles into driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back
anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going
she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned
they came the master of the house was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary and made himself very agreeable by his goodhumoured notice of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice or in the turn of sentiment and expression
mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness uprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person
she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face though her reddened and weatherbeaten complexion the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eightandthirty
her manners were open easy and decided like one who had no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour
anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs crofts side to give a bias of any sort
she was quite easy on that head and consequently full of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by mrs crofts suddenly saying  it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country  anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion she certainly had not
perhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft
she could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel when mrs crofts next words explained it to be mr wentworth of whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother
she immediately felt how reasonable it was that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward and not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbours present state with proper interest
the rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving she heard the admiral say to mary  we are expecting a brother of mrs crofts here soon i dare say you know him by name  he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question
she could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling
the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for when the youngest miss musgrove walked in
that she was coming to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage
and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it
i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard
and we agreed it would be best to have the harp for it seems to amuse her more than the pianoforte
i will tell you why she is out of spirits
when the crofts called this morning they called here afterwards did not they
 they happened to say that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly and most unluckily it came into mammas head when they were gone that wentworth or something very like it was the name of poor richards captain at one time i do not know when or where but a great while before he died poor fellow
and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard
so we must be as merry as we can that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things  the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before
he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thickheaded unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name living or dead
he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board captain frederick wentworths frigate the laconia and from the laconia he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters all the rest had been mere applications for money
in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur
she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed and the reperusal of these letters after so long an interval her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death
mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them
to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from cliftona very fine young manbut they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to annes nerves
she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself
since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points
and not only did it appear that he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect for his character stamped as it was by poor dicks having been six months under his care and mentioning him in strong though not perfectly wellspelt praise as a fine dashing felow only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as they could hear of his arrival
the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening
a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross by the end of another week
it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars
but a week must pass only a week in annes reckoning and then she supposed they must meet and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week
captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgroves civility and she was all but calling there in the same half hour
she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall
the childs situation put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account
his collarbone was found to be dislocated and such injury received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas
it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants
her brothers return was the first comfort he could take best care of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary
till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where but now the collarbone was soon replaced and though mr robinson felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephews state as to give the information of captain wentworths visit staying five minutes behind their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance who had been at all a favourite before
how glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mammas farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrowactually on the morrow and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought
and in short he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles
the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy to give him the meeting
oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs
charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh
no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away
only think if anything should happen  the child had a good night and was going on well the next day
it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity for longer confinement
the child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do
this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no use at home to shut himself up
his father very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house
nothing can be going on better than the child said he so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me quite right
your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all
you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use
anne will send for me if anything is the matter  husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain
mary knew from charless manner of speaking that he was quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him
she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room but as soon as there was only anne to hear  so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening
i knew how it would be
this is always my luck
if there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it and charles is as bad as any of them
very unfeeling
i must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy
talks of his being going on so well
how does he know that he is going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence
i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling
so here he is to go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child
my being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried
i am not at all equal to it
you saw how hysterical i was yesterday  but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarmof the shock
you will not be hysterical again
i dare say we shall have nothing to distress us
i perfectly understand mr robinsons directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband
nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province
a sick child is always the mothers property her own feelings generally make it so  i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know that i am of any more use in the sickroom than charles for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet he was sure to begin kicking about
i have not nerves for the sort of thing  but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy  yes you see his papa can and why should not i
jemima is so careful and she could send us word every hour how he was
i really think charles might as well have told his father we would all come
i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is
i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different today  well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself suppose you were to go as well as your husband
leave little charles to my care
mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain with him  are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening
dear me
thats a very good thought very good indeed
to be sure i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at homeam i
and it only harasses me
you who have not a mothers feelings are a great deal the properest person
you can make little charles do anything he always minds you at a word
it will be a great deal better than leaving him only with jemima
oh
i shall certainly go i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know you do not mind being left alone
an excellent thought of yours indeed anne
i will go and tell charles and get ready directly
you can send for us you know at a moments notice if anything is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you
i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease about my dear child  the next moment she was tapping at her husbands dressingroom door and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for the whole conversation which began with marys saying in a tone of great exultation  i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are
if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like
anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him
it is annes own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday  this is very kind of anne was her husbands answer and i should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child  anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits
they were gone she hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever likely to be hers
she knew herself to be of the first utility to the child and what was it to her if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself agreeable to others
she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting
perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances
he must be either indifferent or unwilling
had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting
her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visit in general
there had been music singing talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with charles
he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being in mrs charles musgroves way on account of the child and therefore somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charless being to meet him to breakfast at his fathers
anne understood it
he wished to avoid seeing her
he had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet
the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those of the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when charles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was come for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient and though charles had answered for the childs being in no such state as could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice
mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was the most consoling that it would soon be over
and it was soon over
in two minutes after charless preparation the others appeared they were in the drawingroom
her eye half met captain wentworths a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary said all that was right said something to the miss musgroves enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons and voices but a few minutes ended it
charles shewed himself at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone the miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen the room was cleared and anne might finish her breakfast as she could
it is over
it is over she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude
the worst is over  mary talked but she could not attend
she had seen him
they had met
they had been once more in the same room
soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less
eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up
how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness
what might not eight years do
events of every description changes alienations removalsall all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past how natural how certain too
it included nearly a third part of her own life
alas
with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing
now how were his sentiments to be read
was this like wishing to avoid her
and the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question
on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary  captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was so attentive to me
henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again  mary had no feelings to make her respect her sisters in a common way but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound
altered beyond his knowledge anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification
doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for the worse
she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would
no the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages
she had seen the same frederick wentworth
so altered that he should not have known her again these were words which could not but dwell with her
yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them
they were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier
frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would be carried round to her
he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had spoken as he felt
he had not forgiven anne elliot
she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure
she had given him up to oblige others
it had been the effect of overpersuasion
it had been weakness and timidity
he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again
her power with him was gone for ever
it was now his object to marry
he was rich and being turned on shore fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow
he had a heart for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting anne elliot
this was his only secret exception when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions  yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match
anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking
a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy and i am a lost man
should not this be enough for a sailor who has had no society among women to make him nice  he said it she knew to be contradicted
his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with
a strong mind with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description
that is the woman i want said he
something a little inferior i shall of course put up with but it must not be much
if i am a fool i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject more than most men       from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly in the same circle
they were soon dining in company together at mr musgroves for the little boys state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings
whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each they could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth
his profession qualified him his disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year six that happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself
there must be the same immediate association of thought though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain
they had no conversation together no intercourse but what the commonest civility required
once so much to each other
now nothing
there had been a time when of all the large party now filling the drawingroom at uppercross they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another
with the exception perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved
now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could never become acquainted
it was a perpetual estrangement
when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind
there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner of living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use
from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgroves who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying  ah
miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son i dare say he would have been just such another by this time  anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore could not keep pace with the conversation of the others
when she could let her attention take its natural course again she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list their own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded
your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp  you will not find her there
quite worn out and broken up
i was the last man who commanded her
hardly fit for service then
reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off to the west indies  the girls looked all amazement
the admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed
but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed  phoo
phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk
never was a better sloop than the asp in her day
for an old built sloop you would not see her equal
lucky fellow to get her
he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time
lucky fellow to get anything so soon with no more interest than his  i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth seriously
i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire
it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea a very great object i wanted to be doing something  to be sure you did
what should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together
if a man had not a wife he soon wants to be afloat again  but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you  i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling
i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself
ah
she was a dear old asp to me
she did all that i wanted
i knew she would
i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted
i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck
we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation not having much improved our condition
fourandtwenty hours later and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me annes shudderings were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror
and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy
charles my dear beckoning him to her do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother
i always forgot  it was at gibraltar mother i know
dick had been left ill at gibraltar with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth  oh
but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend  charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case only nodded in reply and walked away
the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate and present noncommissioned class observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had
ah
those were pleasant days when i had the laconia
how fast i made money in her
a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise together off the western islands
poor harville sister
you know how much he wanted money worse than myself
he had a wife
excellent fellow
i shall never forget his happiness
he felt it all so much for her sake
i wished for him again the next summer when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean  and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us when you were put captain into that ship
we shall never forget what you did  her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more
my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking of poor richard  poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care
ah
it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you
i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you  there was a momentary expression in captain wentworths face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgroves kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of selfamusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parents feelings
they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove
it was no insignificant barrier indeed
mrs musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment and while the agitations of annes slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth should be allowed some credit for the selfcommand with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for
personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions
a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world
but fair or not fair there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vainwhich taste cannot toleratewhich ridicule will seize
the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts began with  if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson and her daughters  should i
i am glad i was not a week later then  the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry
he defended himself though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit which a few hours might comprehend
but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry towards them
it is rather from feeling how impossible it is with all ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have
there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do
i hate to hear of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it  this brought his sister upon him
oh
frederick
but i cannot believe it of youall idle refinementwomen may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england
i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know nothing superior to the accommodations of a manofwar
i declare i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether  nothing to the purpose replied her brother
you were living with your husband and were the only woman on board  but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth
where was this superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then  all merged in my friendship sophia
i would assist any brother officers wife that i could and i would bring anything of harvilles from the worlds end if he wanted it
but do not imagine that i did not feel it an evil in itself  depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable  i might not like them the better for that perhaps
such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board  my dear frederick you are talking quite idly
pray what would become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings  my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville and all her family to plymouth  but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures
we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days  ah
my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife he will sing a different tune
when he is married if we have the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i and a great many others have done
we shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife  ay that we shall  now i have done cried captain wentworth
when once married people begin to attack me withoh
you will think very differently when you are married i can only say no i shall not and then they say again yes you will and there is an end of it  he got up and moved away
what a great traveller you must have been maam said mrs musgrove to mrs croft
pretty well maam in the fifteen years of my marriage though many women have done more
i have crossed the atlantic four times and have been once to the east indies and back again and only once besides being in different places about home cork and lisbon and gibraltar
but i never went beyond the streights and never was in the west indies
we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies  mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life
and i do assure you maam pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a manofwar i speak you know of the higher rates
when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship
while we were together you know there was nothing to be feared
thank god
i have always been blessed with excellent health and no climate disagrees with me
a little disordered always the first twentyfour hours of going to sea but never knew what sickness was afterwards
the only time i ever really suffered in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas
i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience  aye to be sure
yes indeed oh yes
i am quite of your opinion mrs croft was mrs musgroves hearty answer
there is nothing so bad as a separation
i am quite of your opinion
i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again  the evening ended with dancing
on its being proposed anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved
it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits than captain wentworth
she felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference and especially the attention of all the young women could do
the miss hayters the females of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect goodwill between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals
if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration who could wonder
these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without consciousness
once she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced
the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing
she had rather play
she is never tired of playing once too he spoke to her
she had left the instrument on the dancing being over and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the miss musgroves an idea of
unintentionally she returned to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising said with studied politeness  i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced to sit down again
anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches
his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything
captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of the admirals fraternal kindness as of his wifes
he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off
there was so much of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all the charms and perfections of edwards wife upon credit a little longer
it was soon uppercross with him almost every day
the musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig lately added to their establishment
hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth among the musgroves and their dependencies
it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth very much in the way
charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworths introduction
he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood where residence was not required lived at his fathers house only two miles from uppercross
a short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners and of seeing captain wentworth
mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters
they had each had money but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence
mr hayter had some property of his own but it was insignificant compared with mr musgroves and while the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country the young hayters would from their parents inferior retired and unpolished way of living and their own defective education have been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion with uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest
the two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride on one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness of superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleased to improve their cousins
charless attentions to henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation
it would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked himand henrietta did seem to like him
henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten
which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was as yet quite doubtful as far as annes observation reached
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits and she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him
mr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything to take its chance
there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the mansionhouse but it was different at the cottage the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been above four or five times in the miss musgroves company and charles hayter had but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best
charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful
charles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what he had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war
here was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy
oh
it would be a capital match for either of his sisters  upon my word it would replied mary
dear me
if he should rise to any very great honours
if he should ever be made a baronet
lady wentworth sounds very well
that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta
she would take place of me then and henrietta would not dislike that
sir frederick and lady wentworth
it would be but a new creation however and i never think much of your new creations  it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred on the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to
she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewedvery sad for herself and her children
you know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made she has no right to throw herself away
i do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them
and pray who is charles hayter
nothing but a country curate
a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross  her husband however would not agree with her here for besides having a regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son and he saw things as an eldest son himself
now you are talking nonsense mary was therefore his answer
it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very pretty property
the estate at winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton which is some of the best land in the country
i grant you that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very goodnatured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible mangood freehold property
no no henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied  charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as he was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt that he has
she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour
and as to captain wentworths liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best
but charles is so positive
i wish you had been with us yesterday for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you would have thought as i did unless you had been determined to give it against me  a dinner at mr musgroves had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little charles
she had thought only of avoiding captain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening
as to captain wentworths views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta
either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate goodhumoured wife
with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a wellmeaning young woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings the alteration could not be understood too soon
charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousins behaviour
she had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from uppercross but there was such a change as became very alarming when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause
he had been absent only two sundays and when they parted had left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining that of uppercross instead
it had then seemed the object nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office but was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed on engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it
the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going six miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirleys being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa but had been almost everything to henrietta
when he came back alas
the zeal of the business was gone by
louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley she was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation
well i am very glad indeed but i always thought you would have it i always thought you sure
it did not appear to me thatin short you know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise
is he coming louisa  one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into the drawingroom at the cottage where were only herself and the little invalid charles who was lying on the sofa
the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave
they are up stairs with my sister they will be down in a few moments i dare say had been annes reply in all the confusion that was natural and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him she would have been out of the room the next moment and released captain wentworth as well as herself
he continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying i hope the little boy is better was silent
she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there to satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule
she hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easycharles hayter probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne
she only attempted to say how do you do
will you not sit down
the others will be here presently  captain wentworth however came from his window apparently not illdisposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up the newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window
another minute brought another addition
the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away
there being nothing to eat he could only have some play and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that busy as she was about charles she could not shake him off
she spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain
once she did contrive to push him away but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly
walter said she get down this moment
you are extremely troublesome
i am very angry with you  walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid
do not you hear your aunt speak
come to me walter come to cousin charles  but not a bit did walter stir
in another moment however she found herself in the state of being released from him some one was taking him from her though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away before she knew that captain wentworth had done it
her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless
she could not even thank him
she could only hang over little charles with most disordered feelings
his kindness in stepping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares and leave the room
she could not stay
it might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the fourthey were now altogether but she could stay for none of it
it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards captain wentworth
she had a strong impression of his having said in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworths interference you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself
but neither charles hayters feelings nor anybodys feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged her own
she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed of being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her
other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur
anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite she could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either
they were more in love with him yet there it was not love
it was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must end in love with some
charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them
anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to
she did not attribute guile to any
it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning
there was no triumph no pitiful triumph in his manner
he had probably never heard and never thought of any claims of charles hayter
he was only wrong in accepting the attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once
after a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field
three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross a most decided change
he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books before him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death
it was marys hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him tomorrow
anne could only feel that charles hayter was wise
one morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth being gone ashooting together as the sisters in the cottage were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window by the sisters from the mansionhouse
it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undesired and inconvenient
she tried to dissuade mary from going but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept the miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening the interference in any plan of their own
i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk said mary as she went up stairs
everybody is always supposing that i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased if we had refused to join them
when people come in this manner on purpose to ask us how can one say no  just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned
they had taken out a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early
their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure
could anne have foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but from some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was too late to retract and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance
annes object was not to be in the way of anybody and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary to keep with her brother and sister
her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations but it was not possible that when within reach of captain wentworths conversation with either of the miss musgroves she should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable
it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing might fall into
he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta
louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister
this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisas which struck her
after one of the many praises of the day which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added  what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister
they meant to take a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills
they talked of coming into this side of the country
i wonder whereabouts they will upset today
oh
it does happen very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it she would as lieve be tossed out as not  ah
you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were really so i should do just the same in her place
if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else  it was spoken with enthusiasm
had you cried he catching the same tone i honour you and there was silence between them for a little while
anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again
the sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining happiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together blessed her memory
she roused herself to say as they struck by order into another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her
winthrop however or its environsfor young men are sometimes to be met with strolling about near homewas their destination and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures where the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill which parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view of the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side
winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farmyard
mary exclaimed bless me
here is winthrop
i declare i had no idea
well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired  henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready to do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no cried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be arguing the matter warmly
charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too
but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered oh
no indeed
walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good and in short her look and manner declared that go she would not
after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill
louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan and as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her and saying to captain wentworth  it is very unpleasant having such connexions
but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life  she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne perfectly knew the meaning of
the brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot louisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedgerow and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also
she turned through the same gate but could not see them
anne found a nice seat for her on a dry sunny bank under the hedgerow in which she had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other
mary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on till she overtook her
anne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard captain wentworth and louisa in the hedgerow behind her as if making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the centre
they were speaking as they drew near
louisas voice was the first distinguished
she seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech
what anne first heard was  and so i made her go
i could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense
what
would i be turned back from doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say
no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded
when i have made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at winthrop today and yet she was as near giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance  she would have turned back then but for you  she would indeed
i am almost ashamed to say it  happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand
after the hints you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations the last time i was in company with him i need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on
i see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this
your sister is an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness i see
if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can
but this no doubt you have been always doing
it is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on
you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody may sway it
let those who would be happy be firm
here is a nut said he catching one down from an upper bough to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn
not a puncture not a weak spot anywhere
this nut he continued with playful solemnity while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of then returning to his former earnest tonemy first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm
if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life she will cherish all her present powers of mind  he had done and was unanswered
it would have surprised anne if louisa could have readily answered such a speech words of such interest spoken with such serious warmth
she could imagine what louisa was feeling
for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen
while she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her and they were moving on
before they were beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again
mary is goodnatured enough in many respects said she but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense and pridethe elliot pride
she has a great deal too much of the elliot pride
we do so wish that charles had married anne instead
i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne  after a moments pause captain wentworth said  do you mean that she refused him  oh
yes certainly  when did that happen  i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time but i believe about a year before he married mary
i wish she had accepted him
we should all have liked her a great deal better and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend lady russells doing that she did not
they think charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him  the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more
her own emotions still kept her fixed
she had much to recover from before she could move
the listeners proverbial fate was not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard a great deal of very painful import
she saw how her own character was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation
as soon as she could she went after mary and having found and walked back with her to their former station by the stile felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected and once more in motion together
her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give
charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured charles hayter with them
the minutiae of the business anne could not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentlemans side and a relenting on the ladys and that they were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt
henrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleasedcharles hayter exceedingly happy and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross
everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth nothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two
in a long strip of meadow land where there was ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties and to that party of the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged
she joined charles and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charless other arm but charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper with his wife
mary had shewn herself disobliging to him and was now to reap the consequence which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary began to complain of it and lament her being illused according to custom in being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all
this long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it was to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit the carriage advancing in the same direction which had been some time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral crofts gig
he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired it would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross
the invitation was general and generally declined
the miss musgroves were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise
the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an opposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister
the something might be guessed by its effects
miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft
do let us have the pleasure of taking you home
here is excellent room for three i assure you
if we were all like you i believe we might sit four
you must indeed you must  anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline she was not allowed to proceed
the admirals kind urgency came in support of his wifes they would not be refused they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage
yes he had done it
she was in the carriage and felt that he had placed her there that his will and his hands had done it that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution to give her rest
she was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her which all these things made apparent
this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before
she understood him
he could not forgive her but he could not be unfeeling
though condemning her for the past and considering it with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer without the desire of giving her relief
it was a remainder of former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged friendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed
her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given
they had travelled half their way along the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said
she then found them talking of frederick  he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy said the admiral but there is no saying which
he has been running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind
ay this comes of the peace
if it were war now he would have settled it long ago
we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war
how many days was it my dear between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at north yarmouth  we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together
i had known you by character however long before  well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we to wait for besides
i do not like having such things so long in hand
i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home one of these young ladies to kellynch
then there would always be company for them
and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other  very good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft in a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother and a very respectable family
one could not be connected with better people
my dear admiral that post
we shall certainly take that post  but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dungcart and anne with some amusement at their style of driving which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage
the time now approached for lady russells return the day was even fixed and anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it
it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church and there must be intercourse between the two families
this was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time at uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole she believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society in leaving poor mary for lady russell
she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere
they did not like each other and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell to see them together she might think that he had too much selfpossession and she too little
these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough
her usefulness to little charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there but he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for
the conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined
captain wentworth after being unseen and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away
a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last had brought intelligence of captain harvilles being settled with his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore quite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other
captain harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before and captain wentworths anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to lyme
he had been there for fourandtwenty hours
his acquittal was complete his friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to by the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves and a project for going thither was the consequence
the young people were all wild to see lyme
captain wentworth talked of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross though november the weather was by no means bad and in short louisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed the resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer and to lyme they were to gocharles mary anne henrietta louisa and captain wentworth
the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night but to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent and when it came to be rationally considered a day in the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place after deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required for going and returning
they were consequently to stay the night there and not to be expected back till the next days dinner
this was felt to be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house at rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually it was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgroves coach containing the four ladies and charless curricle in which he drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone
after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea
they were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which lyme as a public place might offer
the rooms were shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family but of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town the principal street almost hurrying into the water the walk to the cobb skirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season is animated with bathing machines and company the cobb itself its old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what the strangers eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme to make him wish to know it better
the scenes in its neighbourhood charmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country and still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all pinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the farfamed isle of wight these places must be visited and visited again to make the worth of lyme understood
the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves on the seashore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all proceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself and on captain wentworths account for in a small house near the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled
captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on and he was to join them on the cobb
they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long when they saw him coming after them with three companions all well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville and a captain benwick who was staying with them
captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia and the account which captain wentworth had given of him on his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener had been followed by a little history of his private life which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies
he had been engaged to captain harvilles sister and was now mourning her loss
they had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion
fortune came his prizemoney as lieutenant being great promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it
she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea
captain wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change
he considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading and sedentary pursuits
to finish the interest of the story the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance and captain benwick was now living with them entirely
captain harville had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwicks state of mind
the sympathy and goodwill excited towards captain benwick was very great
and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart than i have
i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever
he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact younger as a man
he will rally again and be happy with another  they all met and were introduced
captain harville was a tall dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame and from strong features and want of health looking much older than captain wentworth
captain benwick looked and was the youngest of the three and compared with either of them a little man
he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation
captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging
mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them
the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them
there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon so unlike the usual style of giveandtake invitations and dinners of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brotherofficers
these would have been all my friends was her thought and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness
on quitting the cobb they all went indoors with their new friends and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many
anne had a moments astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies of lodginghouse furniture and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected
the varieties in the fittingup of the rooms where the common necessaries provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries captain harville had visited were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented made it to her a something more or less than gratification
captain harville was no reader but he had contrived excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves for a tolerable collection of wellbound volumes the property of captain benwick
his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within
he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new nettingneedles and pins with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large fishingnet at one corner of the room
anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be respected and loved
they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn
anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in captain wentworths company than she had at first imagined could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it they never got beyond was become a mere nothing
the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening and he came bringing his friend also which was more than had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers
he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general
while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others it fell to annes lot to be placed rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him
he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion
he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evenings indulgence in the discussion of subjects which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out of their conversation
for though shy he did not seem reserved it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the firstrate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion or the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour and the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly
his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances
captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for the interest implied and though with a shake of the head and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended and promised to procure and read them
when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination
anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast
they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide which a fine southeasterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted
they praised the morning gloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the freshfeeling breezeand were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with  oh
yesi am quite convinced that with very few exceptions the seaair always does good
there can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness last spring twelvemonth
he declares himself that coming to lyme for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again
now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea
i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely and fix at lyme
do not you anne
do not you agree with me that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley
she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of his having another seizure
indeed i think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out from all the world
i wish his friends would propose it to him
i really think they ought
and as to procuring a dispensation there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions overscrupulous i must say
do not you think anne it is being overscrupulous
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties which may be just as well performed by another person
and at lyme too only seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear if people thought there was anything to complain of  anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curates being married
i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion i wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate with dr shirley
i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody
i always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything
i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross  anne was amused by henriettas manner of being grateful and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of henriettas views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the musgrove family she had only time however for a general answer and a wish that such another woman were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them
they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town
they were all at her disposal
when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back and stopped to give them way
they ascended and passed him and as they passed annes face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of
she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye which it had also produced
it was evident that the gentleman completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly
captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it
he gave her a momentary glance a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again  after attending louisa through her business and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their diningroom had nearly run against the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment
she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves and determined that a welllooking groom who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back should be his servant
both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves and this second meeting short as it was also proved again by the gentlemans looks that he thought hers very lovely and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was a man of exceedingly good manners
he seemed about thirty and though not handsome had an agreeable person
anne felt that she should like to know who he was
they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party to the window
it was a gentlemans carriage a curricle but only coming round from the stableyard to the front door somebody must be going away
it was driven by a servant in mourning
the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused annes curiosity and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off
ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne it is the very man we passed  the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table
the waiter came into the room soon afterwards
pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away  yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth
dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath and london  elliot many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity of a waiter
bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed
charles anne must not it
in mourning you see just as our mr elliot must be
how very extraordinary
in the very same inn with us
anne must not it be our mr elliot
my fathers next heir
pray sir turning to the waiter did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged to the kellynch family  no maam he did not mention no particular family but he said his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day  there
you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said
heir to sir walter elliot
i was sure that would come out if it was so
depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish wherever he goes
but anne only conceive how extraordinary
i wish i had looked at him more
i wish we had been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us
what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other
do you think he had the elliot countenance
i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me
oh
the greatcoat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning one should have known him by the livery  putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin  when she could command marys attention anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable
at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense
she would not upon any account mention her having met with him the second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt quite illused by annes having actually run against him in the passage and received his very polite excuses while she had never been near him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret
of course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot the next time you write to bath
i think my father certainly ought to hear of it do mention all about him  anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated but as what ought to be suppressed
the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew elizabeths particular share in it she suspected and that mr elliots idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt
mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth fell on anne
breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain and mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about lyme
they ought to be setting off for uppercross by one and in the meanwhile were to be all together and out of doors as long as they could
anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all fairly in the street
their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together some time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of captain benwick she had captain harville by her side
miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much
i wish he could have such company oftener
it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is but what can we do
we cannot part  no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhapswe know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourneronly last summer i understand  ay true enough with a deep sigh only june  and not known to him perhaps so soon  not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape just made into the grappler
i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth
there the news must follow him but who was to tell it
not i i would as soon have been run up to the yardarm
nobody could do it but that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth
the laconia had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her being sent to sea again
he stood his chance for the rest wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week
thats what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james
you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us  anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject and when he spoke again it was of something totally different
mrs harvilles giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk they would accompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves
by all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew near the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more all were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found would be no difference at all so with all the kind leavetaking and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville at their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick who seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make the proper adieus to the cobb
anne found captain benwick again drawing near her
lord byrons dark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by their present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible
it was soon drawn perforce another way
there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight excepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth
in all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles the sensation was delightful to her
the hardness of the pavement for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion he did it however
she was safely down and instantly to show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again
he advised her against it thought the jar too great but no he reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined i will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless
there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed she breathed not her face was like death
the horror of the moment to all who stood around
captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence
she is dead
she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her husband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable and in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost her senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain benwick and anne who caught and supported her between them
is there no one to help me were the first words which burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if all his own strength were gone
go to him go to him cried anne for heavens sake go to him
i can support her myself
leave me and go to him
rub her hands rub her temples here are salts take them take them  captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them and everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support exclaimed in the bitterest agony  oh god
her father and mother  a surgeon said anne
he caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying onlytrue true a surgeon this instant was darting away when anne eagerly suggested  captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick
he knows where a surgeon is to be found  every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea and in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had resigned the poor corpselike figure entirely to the brothers care and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity
as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most captain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate brother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes from one sister to see the other in a state as insensible or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him for help which he could not give
anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought which instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals to suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth
both seemed to look to her for directions
anne anne cried charles what is to be done next
what in heavens name is to be done next  captain wentworths eyes were also turned towards her
had not she better be carried to the inn
yes i am sure carry her gently to the inn  yes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively collected and eager to be doing something
i will carry her myself
musgrove take care of the others  by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine as the first report
to some of the bestlooking of these good people henrietta was consigned for though partially revived she was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side and charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back with feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately and so light of heart they had passed along
they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them
captain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately informed and directed as they passed towards the spot
shocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done
she must be taken to their house all must go to their house and await the surgeons arrival there
they would not listen to scruples he was obeyed they were all beneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harvilles direction was conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed assistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them
louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again without apparent consciousness
this had been a proof of life however of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility
mary too was growing calmer
the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible
they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless
the head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries recovered from he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully
that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say a few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most and the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered may be conceived
the tone the look with which thank god was uttered by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her nor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them
louisas limbs had escaped
there was no injury but to the head
it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done as to their general situation
they were now able to speak to each other and consult
that louisa must remain where she was however distressing to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble did not admit a doubt
her removal was impossible
the harvilles silenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude
they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect
captain benwick must give up his room to them and get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled
they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay though with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harvilles care entirely
mrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nurserymaid who had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere was just such another
between these two she could want no possible attendance by day or night
and all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible
charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror
uppercross the necessity of some ones going to uppercross the news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they ought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time at first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth exerting himself said  we must be decided and without the loss of another minute
every minute is valuable
some one must resolve on being off for uppercross instantly
musgrove either you or i must go  charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away
he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would
so far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same
she however was soon persuaded to think differently
the usefulness of her staying
she who had not been able to remain in louisas room or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless
she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought of her father and mother she gave it up she consented she was anxious to be at home
the plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly down from louisas room could not but hear what followed for the parlour door was open
then it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth that you stay and that i take care of your sister home
but as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville i think it need be only one
mrs charles musgrove will of course wish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so proper so capable as anne  she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of
the other two warmly agreed with what he said and she then appeared
you will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he turning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness which seemed almost restoring the past
she coloured deeply and he recollected himself and moved away
she expressed herself most willing ready happy to remain
it was what she had been thinking of and wishing to be allowed to do
a bed on the floor in louisas room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville would but think so  one thing more and all seemed arranged
though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense and captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn and leave mr musgroves carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisas night
captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part and to be soon followed by the two ladies
when the plan was made known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it
she was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was nothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best right to stay in henriettas stead
why was not she to be as useful as anne
and to go home without charles too without her husband
no it was too unkind
and in short she said more than her husband could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for anne was inevitable
anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and illjudging claims of mary but so it must be and they set off for the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick attending to her
she gave a moments recollection as they hurried along to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning
there she had listened to henriettas schemes for dr shirleys leaving uppercross farther on she had first seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare
captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her and united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt an increasing degree of goodwill towards him and a pleasure even in thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance
captain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other the change in his countenance the astonishment the expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened to made but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa
she endeavoured to be composed and to be just
without emulating the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard for his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend
in the meanwhile she was in the carriage
he had handed them both in and placed himself between them and in this manner under these circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme
how the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee
it was all quite natural however
he was devoted to henrietta always turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits
in general his voice and manner were studiously calm
to spare henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle
once only when she had been grieving over the last illjudged illfated walk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of he burst forth as if wholly overcome  dont talk of it dont talk of it he cried
oh god
that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment
had i done as i ought
but so eager and so resolute
dear sweet louisa  anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that like all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions and limits
she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character
they got on fast
anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon
their actual speed heightened by some dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long as on the day before
it was growing quite dusk however before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth
in a low cautious voice he said  i have been considering what we had best do
she must not appear at first
she could not stand it
i have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in and break it to mr and mrs musgrove
do you think this is a good plan  she did he was satisfied and said no more
but the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship and of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became a sort of parting proof its value did not lessen
when the distressing communication at uppercross was over and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped and the daughter all the better for being with them he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme and when the horses were baited he was off
end of volume one
the remainder of annes time at uppercross comprehending only two days was spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which in mr and mrs musgroves distressed state of spirits would have been difficulties
they had an early account from lyme the next morning
louisa was much the same
no symptoms worse than before had appeared
charles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and more particular account
he was tolerably cheerful
a speedy cure must not be hoped but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted
in speaking of the harvilles he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness especially of mrs harvilles exertions as a nurse
she really left nothing for mary to do
he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night
mary had been hysterical again this morning
when he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick which he hoped would do her good
he almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do  charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent
it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon
a chaise was sent for from crewkherne and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nurserymaid of the family one who having brought up all the children and seen the very last the lingering and longpetted master harry sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa
vague wishes of getting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on and found practicable so soon
they were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all the minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain every twentyfour hours
he made it his business to go to lyme and his account was still encouraging
the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger
every report agreed in captain wentworths appearing fixed in lyme
anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded
what should they do without her
they were wretched comforters for one another and so much was said in this way that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once
she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go go tomorrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings as it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved
they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations and sending them off at an early hour though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence
she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage she was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses of all that had given uppercross its cheerful character
a few days had made a change indeed
if louisa recovered it would all be well again
more than former happiness would be restored
there could not be a doubt to her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery
a few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy and gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love all that was most unlike anne elliot
an hours complete leisure for such reflections as these on a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough to make the sound of lady russells carriage exceedingly welcome and yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house or look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and comfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart
scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious
it stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe but now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling some breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear
she left it all behind her all but the recollection that such things had been
anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russells house in september
it had not been necessary and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade and escape from
her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes of its mistress
there was some anxiety mixed with lady russells joy in meeting her
she knew who had been frequenting uppercross
but happily either anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell fancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty
when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change
the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest
she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath
their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place which had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove and all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick than her own fathers house in camden place or her own sisters intimacy with mrs clay
she was actually forced to exert herself to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude on topics which had by nature the first claim on her
there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject
they must speak of the accident at lyme
lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence lament the result and captain wentworths name must be mentioned by both
anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to lady russells eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa
when this was told his name distressed her no longer
lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt that the man who at twentythree had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa musgrove
the first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme which found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought a rather improving account of louisa
at the end of that period lady russells politeness could repose no longer and the fainter selfthreatenings of the past became in a decided tone i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon
anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house
it will be some trial to us both  anne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said in observing  i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it  she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact so high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure of a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed into better hands than its owners
these convictions must unquestionably have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again and returning through the wellknown apartments
in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself these rooms ought to belong only to us
oh how fallen in their destination
how unworthily occupied
an ancient family to be so driven away
strangers filling their place no except when she thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description to heave
mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion receiving her in that house there was particular attention
the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time since the accident had brought anne the last note which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours and then returned again to lyme and without any present intention of quitting it any more
he had enquired after her she found particularly had expressed his hope of miss elliots not being the worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great
this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done
as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work on ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence that its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think how long miss musgroves recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter
the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming  ay a very bad business indeed
a new sort of way this for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistresss head is not it miss elliot
this is breaking a head and giving a plaster truly  admiral crofts manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell but they delighted anne
his goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible
now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from a little reverie to be coming and finding us here
i had not recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad
but now do not stand upon ceremony
get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it  another time sir i thank you not now  well whenever it suits you
you can slip in from the shrubbery at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door
a good place is not it
but checking himself you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the butlers room
ay so it always is i believe
one mans ways may be as good as anothers but we all like our own best
and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not  anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully
we have made very few changes either continued the admiral after thinking a moment
very few
we told you about the laundrydoor at uppercross
that has been a very great improvement
the wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did so long
you will tell sir walter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had
indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better
my wife should have the credit of them however
i have done very little besides sending away some of the large lookingglasses from my dressingroom which was your fathers
a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure but i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life
such a number of lookingglasses
oh lord
there was no getting away from ones self
so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing that i never go near  anne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough took up the subject again to say  the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give him my compliments and mrs crofts and say that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place
the breakfastroom chimney smokes a little i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard which may not happen three times a winter
and take it altogether now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge there is not one that we like better than this
pray say so with my compliments
he will be glad to hear it  lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present for when it was returned the crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath
so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall or of seeing him in company with her friend
everything was safe enough and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject
though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after mr and mrs musgroves going than anne conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross they drove over to the lodge
they had left louisa beginning to sit up but her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them
they had been all in lodgings together
mrs musgrove had got mrs harvilles children away as much as she could every possible supply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience to the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable
mary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer
charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maidservant to wait and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence but then she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much going on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the harvilles and she had got books from the library and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been much in favour of lyme
she had been taken to charmouth too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight
anne enquired after captain benwick
marys face was clouded directly
charles laughed
oh
captain benwick is very well i believe but he is a very odd young man
i do not know what he would be at
we asked him to come home with us for a day or two charles undertook to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part i thought it was all settled when behold
on tuesday night he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come
i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage for such a heartbroken man as captain benwick  charles laughed again and said now mary you know very well how it really was
it was all your doing turning to anne
he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him and he had not courage to come
that is the fact upon my honour
mary knows it is  but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be left to be guessed
annes goodwill however was not to be lessened by what she heard
she boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries
oh
he talks of you cried charles in such terms mary interrupted him
i declare charles i never heard him mention anne twice all the time i was there
i declare anne he never talks of you at all  no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly
his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinksoh
i cannot pretend to remember it but it was something very finei overheard him telling henrietta all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms
now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were in the other room
elegance sweetness beauty oh
there was no end of miss elliots charms  and i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit if he did
miss harville only died last june
such a heart is very little worth having is it lady russell
i am sure you will agree with me  i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling
and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you maam said charles
though he had not nerves for coming away with us and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself you may depend on it
i told him the distance and the road and i told him of the churchs being so very well worth seeing for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon
so i give you notice lady russell  any acquaintance of annes will always be welcome to me was lady russells kind answer
oh
as to being annes acquaintance said mary i think he is rather my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight  well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy to see captain benwick  you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you maam
he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived
he has walked with me sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word
he is not at all a wellbred young man
i am sure you will not like him  there we differ mary said anne
i think lady russell would like him
i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner  so do i anne said charles
i am sure lady russell would like him
he is just lady russells sort
give him a book and he will read all day long  yes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly
he will sit poring over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one drops ones scissors or anything that happens
do you think lady russell would like that  lady russell could not help laughing
upon my word said she i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact as i may call myself
i have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions
i wish he may be induced to call here
and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand  you will not like him i will answer for it  lady russell began talking of something else
mary spoke with animation of their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily
he is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see
his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me  this decision checked marys eagerness and stopped her short in the midst of the elliot countenance
with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries there was voluntary communication sufficient
his spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected
as louisa improved he had improved and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week
he had not seen louisa and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not press for it at all and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger
he had talked of going down to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick to go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch
there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both occasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time
lady russell could not hear the doorbell without feeling that it might be his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her fathers grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him
captain benwick came not however
he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him a weeks indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite
the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school bringing with them mrs harvilles little children to improve the noise of uppercross and lessen that of lyme
henrietta remained with louisa but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters
lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in
immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them
on one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk and gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys were holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire which seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise of the others
charles and mary also came in of course during their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children on his knees generally in vain
it was a fine familypiece
anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves which louisas illness must have so greatly shaken
but mrs musgrove who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for all her attentions to them concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home
louisa was now recovering apace
her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters went to school again
the harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at uppercross whenever she returned
captain wentworth was gone for the present to see his brother in shropshire
i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays  everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters and sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort rather than their quantity
when lady russell not long afterwards was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place amidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays the bawling of newspapermen muffinmen and milkmen and the ceaseless clink of pattens she made no complaint
no these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose under their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feeling though not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness
anne did not share these feelings
she persisted in a very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her when she arrived
and looked back with fond regret to the bustles of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch
elizabeths last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest
mr elliot was in bath
he had called in camden place had called a second time a third had been pointedly attentive
if elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect
this was very wonderful if it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had no wish to see she had a great wish to see him
if he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree
anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath
she was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings in rivers street
sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place a lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction
anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment of many months and anxiously saying to herself oh
when shall i leave you again a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome she received did her good
her father and sister were glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture and met her with kindness
her making a fourth when they sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage
mrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course
anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for
they were evidently in excellent spirits and she was soon to listen to the causes
they had no inclination to listen to her
after laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay they had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be all their own
uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little it was all bath
they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered their expectations in every respect
their house was undoubtedly the best in camden place their drawingrooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of and the superiority was not less in the style of the fittingup or the taste of the furniture
their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after
everybody was wanting to visit them
they had drawn back from many introductions and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing
here were funds of enjoyment
could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy
she might not wonder but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open the foldingdoors and walked with exultation from one drawingroom to the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman who had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder
but this was not all which they had to make them happy
they had mr elliot too
anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him
he had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath in november in his way to london when the intelligence of sir walters being settled there had of course reached him though only twentyfour hours in the place but he had not been able to avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath and his first object on arriving had been to leave his card in camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct such readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received as a relation again that their former good understanding was completely reestablished
they had not a fault to find in him
he had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side
it had originated in misapprehension entirely
he had never had an idea of throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent
upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours he was quite indignant
he who had ever boasted of being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day
he was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct must refute it
he could refer sir walter to all who knew him and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation and heirpresumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject
the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of much extenuation
this was an article not to be entered on by himself but a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly respectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an illlooking man sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough buildings and had at his own particular request been admitted to their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage which made a material difference in the discredit of it
colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story
she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend
there had been the charm
she had sought him
without that attraction not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman
here was a great deal to soften the business
a very fine woman with a large fortune in love with him
sir walter seemed to admit it as complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation
mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place
anne listened but without quite understanding it
allowances large allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke
she heard it all under embellishment
all that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators
still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in mr elliots wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them
in a worldly view he had nothing to gain by being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance
in all probability he was already the richer of the two and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title
a sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man why should it be an object to him
she could only offer one solution it was perhaps for elizabeths sake
there might really have been a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way and now that he could afford to please himself he might mean to pay his addresses to her
elizabeth was certainly very handsome with wellbred elegant manners and her character might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public and when very young himself
how her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one
most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth were his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent by a glance or two between them while mr elliots frequent visits were talked of
anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without being much attended to
oh
yes perhaps it had been mr elliot
they did not know
it might be him perhaps they could not listen to her description of him
they were describing him themselves sir walter especially
he did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face his sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being very much underhung a defect which time seemed to have increased nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse
mr elliot appeared to think that he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted but sir walter had not been able to return the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him
he did not mean to complain however
mr elliot was better to look at than most men and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere  mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of the whole evening
colonel wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them
and mr elliot so anxious that he should and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description as she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot spoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known in camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted
sir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be an excessively pretty woman beautiful
he longed to see her
he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets
the worst of bath was the number of its plain women
he did not mean to say that there were no pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion
he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face would be followed by thirty or fiveandthirty frights and once as he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted eightyseven women go by one after another without there being a tolerable face among them
it had been a frosty morning to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of
but still there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men
they were infinitely worse
such scarecrows as the streets were full of
it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced
he had never walked anywhere arminarm with colonel wallis who was a fine military figure though sandyhaired without observing that every womans eye was upon him every womans eye was sure to be upon colonel wallis modest sir walter
he was not allowed to escape however
his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting that colonel walliss companion might have as good a figure as colonel wallis and certainly was not sandyhaired
how is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour
the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not happen every day  oh
no that must have been quite accidental
in general she has been in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas  if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse  anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown or a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door suspended everything
a knock at the door
and so late
it was ten oclock
could it be mr elliot
they knew he was to dine in lansdown crescent
it was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did
they could think of no one else
mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliots knock mrs clay was right
with all the state which a butler and footboy could give mr elliot was ushered into the room
it was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress
anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was all as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part must follow then
sir walter talked of his youngest daughter mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter there was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement at his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware of who she was
he looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased his eyes brightened
and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already
he was quite as goodlooking as he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them in excellence to only one persons manners
they were not the same but they were perhaps equally good
he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much
there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man
ten minutes were enough to certify that
his tone his expressions his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all the operation of a sensible discerning mind
as soon as he could he began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions respecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time to give his own route understand something of hers and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her
she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme
his regret increased as he listened
he had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices mirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself
if he had but asked who the party were
the name of musgrove would have told him enough
well it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn which he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious
the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world
the folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view  but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone he knew it he was soon diffused again among the others and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme
his enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place
having alluded to an accident he must hear the whole
when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt
she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish of really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it
he staid an hour with them
the elegant little clock on the mantelpiece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long
anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in camden place could have passed so well
there was one point which anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliots being in love with elizabeth which was her fathers not being in love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours
on going down to breakfast the next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence on the ladys side of meaning to leave them
she could imagine mrs clay to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself at all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper that must not be any reason indeed
i assure you i feel it none
she is nothing to me compared with you and she was in full time to hear her father say my dear madam this must not be
as yet you have seen nothing of bath
you have been here only to be useful
you must not run away from us now
you must stay to be acquainted with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis
to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification  he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself
her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister
the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties and promise to stay
in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher
had she been using any thing in particular no nothing merely gowland he supposed
no nothing at all ha
he was surprised at that and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland the constant use of gowland during the spring months
mrs clay has been using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her
you see how it has carried away her freckles  if elizabeth could but have heard this
such personal praise might have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne that the freckles were at all lessened
but everything must take its chance
the evil of a marriage would be much diminished if elizabeth were also to marry
as for herself she might always command a home with lady russell
lady russells composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point in her intercourse in camden place
the sight of mrs clay in such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bath who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed
as mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable or more indifferent towards the others
his manners were an immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first as she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man
everything united in him good understanding correct opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart
he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour without pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune without display he judged for himself in everything essential without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum
he was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicities of domestic life which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess
she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage
colonel wallis said it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his thinking of a second choice
her satisfaction in mr elliot outweighed all the plague of mrs clay
it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently and it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require more motives than appeared in mr elliots great desire of a reconciliation
in lady russells view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot at a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring in the heyday of youth
anne presumed however still to smile about it and at last to mention elizabeth lady russell listened and looked and made only this cautious replyelizabeth
very well time will explain  it was a reference to the future which anne after a little observation felt she must submit to
she could determine nothing at present
in that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit of such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible
mr elliot too it must be remembered had not been a widower seven months
a little delay on his side might be very excusable
in fact anne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that she was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved
however it might end he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath she saw nobody equal to him and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of as herself
they went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times
he gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness
she knew it well and she remembered another persons look also
they did not always think alike
his value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers
it was not merely complaisance it must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly into her father and sisters solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them
the bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple and her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfort of no
 camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymples in annes opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly
anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility and she must acknowledge herself disappointed
she had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen a wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple and miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears all day long
sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount but had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walters at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland
the neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch and consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed
how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted as cousins again was the question and it was a question which in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot thought unimportant
family connexions were always worth preserving good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house for three months in laura place and would be living in style
she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman
it was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots  sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty to his right honourable cousin
neither lady russell nor mr elliot could admire the letter but it did all that was wanted in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess
she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance the toils of the business were over the sweets began
they visited in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple and the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might be most visible and our cousins in laura placeour cousin lady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody
anne was ashamed
had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created but they were nothing
there was no superiority of manner accomplishment or understanding
lady dalrymple had acquired the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody
miss carteret with still less to say was so plain and so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place but for her birth
lady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet it was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion as good company as those who would collect good company around them they had their value
anne smiled and said  my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever wellinformed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what i call good company  you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company that is the best
good company requires only birth education and manners and with regard to education is not very nice
birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary it will do very well
my cousin anne shakes her head
she is not satisfied
she is fastidious
my dear cousin sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman i know but will it answer
will it make you happy
will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible
you may depend upon it that they will move in the first set in bath this winter and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for  yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance
i suppose smiling i have more pride than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them  pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims
in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living it might be as you say but in bath sir walter elliot and his family will always be worth knowing always acceptable as acquaintance  well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place  i love your indignation said he it is very natural
but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot
you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem a little different
in one point i am sure my dear cousin he continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room in one point i am sure we must feel alike
we must feel that every addition to your fathers society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him  he looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been lately occupying a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her fathers getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her
while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description
she had called on her former governess and had heard from her of there being an old schoolfellow in bath who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering
miss hamilton now mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable
anne had gone unhappy to school grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved feeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time and miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want of near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery and could never be remembered with indifference
miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards was said to have married a man of fortune and this was all that anne had known of her till now that their governesss account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form
she was a widow and poor
her husband had been extravagant and at his death about two years before had left his affairs dreadfully involved
she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for the present a cripple
she had come to bath on that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths living in a very humble way unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society
their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore lost no time in going
she mentioned nothing of what she had heard or what she intended at home
it would excite no proper interest there
she only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smiths lodgings in westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken
the visit was paid their acquaintance reestablished their interest in each other more than rekindled
the first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion
twelve years were gone since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined
twelve years had changed anne from the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant little woman of sevenandtwenty with every beauty except bloom and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle and twelve years had transformed the finelooking wellgrown miss hamilton in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor infirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times
anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation
neither the dissipations of the pastand she had lived very much in the worldnor the restrictions of the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits
in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness and annes astonishment increased
she could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smiths
she had been very fond of her husband she had buried him
she had been used to affluence it was gone
she had no child to connect her with life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable
her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath
yet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation and enjoyment
how could it be
she watched observed reflected and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only
a submissive spirit might be patient a strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more here was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted that power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment which carried her out of herself which was from nature alone
it was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want
there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits had nearly failed
she could not call herself an invalid now compared with her state on first reaching bath
then she had indeed been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense
she had weathered it however and could truly say that it had done her good
it had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands
she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house when unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her
and she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably has really proved an invaluable acquaintance
as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement and she put me in the way of making these little threadcases pincushions and cardracks which you always find me so busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood
she had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those who can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise
she always takes the right time for applying
everybodys heart is open you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke thoroughly understands when to speak
she is a shrewd intelligent sensible woman
hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to
call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hours leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable something that makes one know ones species better
one likes to hear what is going on to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly
to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat  anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied i can easily believe it
women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to
such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing
and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting
what instances must pass before them of ardent disinterested selfdenying attachment of heroism fortitude patience resignation of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most
a sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes  yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe
here and there human nature may be great in times of trial but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of
there is so little real friendship in the world
and unfortunately speaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late  anne saw the misery of such feelings
the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved
it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off and soon added in a different tone  i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present will furnish much either to interest or edify me
she is only nursing mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery
i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however
she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the highpriced things i have in hand now  anne had called several times on her friend before the existence of such a person was known in camden place
at last it became necessary to speak of her
sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening in westgate buildings
she was not sorry for the excuse
they were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account with great alacrityshe was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow they were not much interested in anything relative to anne but still there were questions enough asked to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabeth was disdainful and sir walter severe
westgate buildings said he and who is miss anne elliot to be visiting in westgate buildings
a mrs smith
a widow mrs smith and who was her husband
one of five thousand mr smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere
and what is her attraction
that she is old and sickly
upon my word miss anne elliot you have the most extraordinary taste
everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you
but surely you may put off this old lady till tomorrow she is not so near her end i presume but that she may hope to see another day
what is her age
forty  no sir she is not oneandthirty but i do not think i can put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself
she goes into the warm bath tomorrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged  but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth
she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary she approves it and has generally taken me when i have called on mrs smith  westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter
sir henry russells widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot
a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings
a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty a mere mrs smith an everyday mrs smith of all people and all names in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of england and ireland
mrs smith
such a name  mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much and did long to say a little in defence of her friends not very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her
she made no reply
she left it to himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on and no surname of dignity
anne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening
she had been the only one of the set absent for sir walter and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyships service themselves but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her
anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from lady russell
to her its greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of between her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regretted and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause
her kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot
he thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners mind a model of female excellence
he could meet even lady russell in a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create
lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot
she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of his deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing
she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance supposing such attachment to be real and returned
anne heard her and made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed and gently shook her head
i am no matchmaker as you well know said lady russell being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations
i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together
a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think it might be a very happy one  mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects i think highly of him said anne but we should not suit  lady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying your dear mothers place succeeding to all her rights and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be the highest possible gratification to me
you are your mothers self in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued
my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life  anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings this picture excited
for a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched
the idea of becoming what her mother had been of having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist
lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter to its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himselfshe believed in short what anne did not believe
the same image of mr elliot speaking for himself brought anne to composure again
the charm of kellynch and of lady elliot all faded away
she never could accept him
and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against mr elliot
though they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character
that he was a sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough
he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct
she distrusted the past if not the present
the names which occasionally dropt of former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been
she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling had been a common thing that there had been a period of his life and probably not a short one when he had been at least careless in all serious matters and though he might now think very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character
how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed
mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open
there was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight at the evil or good of others
this to anne was a decided imperfection
her early impressions were incurable
she prized the frank the openhearted the eager character beyond all others
warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still
she felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind never varied whose tongue never slipped
mr elliot was too generally agreeable
various as were the tempers in her fathers house he pleased them all
he endured too well stood too well with every body
he had spoken to her with some degree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see what mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body
lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend for she saw nothing to excite distrust
she could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of the following autumn
it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme
she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated
it was three weeks since she had heard at all
she only knew that henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be recovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary was delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise with admiral and mrs crofts compliments
the crofts must be in bath
a circumstance to interest her
they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally
what is this cried sir walter
the crofts have arrived in bath
the crofts who rent kellynch
what have they brought you  a letter from uppercross cottage sir  oh
those letters are convenient passports
they secure an introduction
i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate
i know what is due to my tenant  anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how the poor admirals complexion escaped her letter engrossed her
it had been begun several days back
february st
my dear anne  i make no apology for my silence because i know how little people think of letters in such a place as bath
you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which as you well know affords little to write about
we have had a very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays
i do not reckon the hayters as anybody
the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long ones
i am sure i had not
the house was cleared yesterday except of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home
mrs harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long
i do not understand it
they are not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren
what dreadful weather we have had
it may not be felt in bath with your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence
i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome
between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way
the carriage is gone today to bring louisa and the harvilles tomorrow
we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there tomorrow
i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted with him too but i have my usual luck i am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family to be noticed
what an immense time mrs clay has been staying with elizabeth
does she never mean to go away
but perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited
let me know what you think of this
i do not expect my children to be asked you know
i can leave them at the great house very well for a month or six weeks
i have this moment heard that the crofts are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty
charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility to give me any notice or of offering to take anything
i do not think they improve at all as neighbours
we see nothing of them and this is really an instance of gross inattention
charles joins me in love and everything proper
yours affectionately  mary m   i am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sorethroat very much about
i dare say i shall catch it and my sorethroats you know are always worse than anybodys  so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope containing nearly as much more
i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal to add
in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed addressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as i like
the admiral does not seem very ill and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants
i shall be truly glad to have them back again
our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family
but now for louisa
i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little
she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening we went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised not to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited as well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason
neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer from mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her before she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville
true upon my honour
are not you astonished
i shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did
mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter
we are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her marrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter and mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick is expected today
mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sisters account but however louisa is a great favourite with both
indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her
charles wonders what captain wentworth will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa i never could see anything of it
and this is the end you see of captain benwicks being supposed to be an admirer of yours
how charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me
i hope he will be more agreeable now
certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better than marrying among the hayters  mary need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared for the news
she had never in her life been more astonished
captain benwick and louisa musgrove
it was almost too wonderful for belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions of the moment
happily for her they were not many
sir walter wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had little curiosity beyond
how is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer and pray what brings the crofts to bath  they come on the admirals account
he is thought to be gouty  gout and decrepitude said sir walter
poor old gentleman  have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth
i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral crofts time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this  i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall
elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place  oh no
i think not
situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve
if we were not related it would not signify but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours
we had better leave the crofts to find their own level
there are several oddlooking men walking about here who i am told are sailors
the crofts will associate with them  this was sir walter and elizabeths share of interest in the letter when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys anne was at liberty
in her own room she tried to comprehend it
well might charles wonder how captain wentworth would feel
perhaps he had quitted the field had given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend
she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly
captain benwick and louisa musgrove
the highspirited joyoustalking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking feeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other
their minds most dissimilar
where could have been the attraction
the answer soon presented itself
it had been in situation
they had been thrown together several weeks they had been living in the same small family party since henriettas coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other and louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state and captain benwick was not inconsolable
that was a point which anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing the same conclusion as mary from the present course of events they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself
she did not mean however to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary might have allowed
she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment
he had an affectionate heart
he must love somebody
she saw no reason against their being happy
louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike
he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already of course they had fallen in love over poetry
the idea of louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste and sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt of its being so
the day at lyme the fall from the cobb might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to the end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate
the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible of captain wentworths merits could be allowed to prefer another man there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing to be regretted
no it was not regret which made annes heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free
she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate
they were too much like joy senseless joy
she longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them
the visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove was mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile
the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street perfectly to sir walters satisfaction
he was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him
the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure
they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together
he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft seemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk for her life to do him good
anne saw them wherever she went
lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them
knowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her
she always watched them as long as she could delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of as they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted to see the admirals hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her
anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days after the crofts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend or her friends carriage in the lower part of the town and return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral
he was standing by himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him in earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have passed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice
when he did perceive and acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour
ha
is it you
thank you thank you
this is treating me like a friend
here i am you see staring at a picture
i can never get by this shop without stopping
but what a thing here is by way of a boat
do look at it
did you ever see the like
what queer fellows your fine painters must be to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that
and yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment which they certainly must be
i wonder where that boat was built laughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it
well turning away now where are you bound
can i go anywhere for you or with you
can i be of any use  none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together
i am going home  that i will with all my heart and farther too
yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along
there take my arm thats right i do not feel comfortable if i have not a woman there
lord
what a boat it is taking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion
did you say that you had something to tell me sir  yes i have presently
but here comes a friend captain brigden i shall only say how dye do as we pass however
i shall not stop
how dye do brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife
she poor soul is tied by the leg
she has a blister on one of her heels as large as a threeshilling piece
if you look across the street you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother
shabby fellows both of them
i am glad they are not on this side of the way
sophy cannot bear them
they played me a pitiful trick once got away with some of my best men
i will tell you the whole story another time
there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson
look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife
ah
the peace has come too soon for that younker
poor old sir archibald
how do you like bath miss elliot
it suits us very well
we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings and draw in our chairs and are as snug as if we were at kellynch ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal
we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth
the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way  when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate
she hoped when clear of milsom street to have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was not really mrs croft she must let him have his own way
as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began  well now you shall hear something that will surprise you
but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady i am going to talk about
that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for
the miss musgrove that all this has been happening to
her christian name i always forget her christian name  anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa  ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name
i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names
i should never be out if they were all sophys or something of that sort
well this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick
he was courting her week after week
the only wonder was what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right
but even then there was something odd in their way of going on
instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth and then he went off to see edward
when we came back from minehead he was gone down to edwards and there he has been ever since
we have seen nothing of him since november
even sophy could not understand it
but now the matter has taken the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick
you know james benwick  a little
i am a little acquainted with captain benwick  well she is to marry him
nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for  i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne and i understand that he bears an excellent character  oh
yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick
he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of
an excellent goodhearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice  indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit from captain benwicks manners
i thought them particularly pleasing and i will answer for it they would generally please  well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality sophy and i cannot help thinking fredericks manners better than his
there is something about frederick more to our taste  anne was caught
she had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all to represent captain benwicks manners as the very best that could possibly be and after a little hesitation she was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison of the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with  and the thing is certainly true
it is not a mere bit of gossip
we have it from frederick himself
his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross
i fancy they are all at uppercross  this was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain wentworths letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy
it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally and without violence
i hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an illused man  not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end  anne looked down to hide her smile
no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has too much spirit for that
if the girl likes another man better it is very fit she should have him  certainly
but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself illused by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said
i should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort  yes yes i understand you
but there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter
he does not give the least fling at benwick does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own for wondering at it no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss whats her name
for himself
he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is nothing very unforgiving in that i think  anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther
she therefore satisfied herself with commonplace remarks or quiet attention and the admiral had it all his own way
poor frederick said he at last
now he must begin all over again with somebody else
i think we must get him to bath
sophy must write and beg him to come to bath
here are pretty girls enough i am sure
it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson
do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath       while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth was already on his way thither
before mrs croft had written he was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him
mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay
they were in milsom street
it began to rain not much but enough to make shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in lady dalrymples carriage which was seen waiting at a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore turned into mollands while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple to request her assistance
he soon joined them again successful of course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home and would call for them in a few minutes
her ladyships carriage was a barouche and did not hold more than four with any comfort
miss carteret was with her mother consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three camden place ladies
there could be no doubt as to miss elliot
whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two
the rain was a mere trifle and anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot
but the rain was also a mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her boots were so thick
much thicker than miss annes and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were obliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay had a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal that his cousin annes boots were rather the thickest
it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party in the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne as she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly captain wentworth walking down the street
her start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable and absurd
for a few minutes she saw nothing before her it was all confusion
she was lost and when she had scolded back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs clays
she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door she wanted to see if it rained
why was she to suspect herself of another motive
captain wentworth must be out of sight
she left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was
she would see if it rained
she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of captain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined a little below milsom street
he was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before he looked quite red
for the first time since their renewed acquaintance she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two
she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments
all the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects of strong surprise were over with her
still however she had enough to feel
it was agitation pain pleasure a something between delight and misery
he spoke to her and then turned away
the character of his manner was embarrassment
she could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything so certainly as embarrassed
after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again
mutual enquiries on common subjects passed neither of them probably much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly
they had by dint of being so very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now
time had changed him or louisa had changed him
there was consciousness of some sort or other
he looked very well not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross of the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was
it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth would not know him
she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him that there was complete internal recognition on each side she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness
lady dalrymples carriage for which miss elliot was growing very impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it
it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miss elliot
at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but by the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off and captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne and by manner rather than words was offering his services to her
i am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them
the carriage would not accommodate so many
i walk i prefer walking  but it rains  oh
very little nothing that i regard  after a moments pause he said though i came only yesterday i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see pointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair  she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating her conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present and adding i am only waiting for mr elliot
he will be here in a moment i am sure  she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in
captain wentworth recollected him perfectly
there was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme admiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend
he came in with eagerness appeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay was grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased and in another moment they walked off together her arm under his a gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you being all that she had time for as she passed away
as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworths party began talking of them
mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy  oh
no that is clear enough
one can guess what will happen there
he is always with them half lives in the family i believe
what a very goodlooking man  yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with  she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes to look at her
it is not the fashion to say so but i confess i admire her more than her sister  oh
so do i  and so do i
no comparison
but the men are all wild after miss elliot
anne is too delicate for them  anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have walked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word
she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting praise warm just and discriminating of lady russell and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay
but just now she could think only of captain wentworth
she could not understand his present feelings whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not and till that point were settled she could not be quite herself
she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas
alas
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet
another circumstance very essential for her to know was how long he meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not recollect it
he might be only passing through
but it was more probable that he should be come to stay
in that case so liable as every body was to meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere
would she recollect him
how would it all be
she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove was to marry captain benwick
it had cost her something to encounter lady russells surprise and now if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him
the following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last in returning down pulteney street she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street
there were many other men about him many groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him
she looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself
no it was not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite
she looked at her however from time to time anxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of lady russells eyes being turned exactly in the direction for himof her being in short intently observing him
she could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russells mind the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him and in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him of one personal grace
at last lady russell drew back her head
now how would she speak of him  you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long but i was looking after some windowcurtains which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night
they described the drawingroom windowcurtains of one of the houses on this side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description  anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain either at her friend or herself
the part which provoked her most was that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them
a day or two passed without producing anything
the theatre or the rooms where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough for the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening
it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple
of course they must attend
it was really expected to be a good one and captain wentworth was very fond of music
if she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred
elizabeth had turned from him lady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention
she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow
mrs smith gave a most goodhumoured acquiescence
by all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come
who is your party  anne named them all
mrs smith made no reply but when she was leaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me tomorrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding that i may not have many more visits from you  anne was startled and confused but after standing in a moments suspense was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away
sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymple must be waited for they took their station by one of the fires in the octagon room
but hardly were they so settled when the door opened again and captain wentworth walked in alone
anne was the nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke
he was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do brought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries in return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground
their being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothing of their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done
while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth caught her ear
she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject and on captain wentworths making a distant bow she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself
this though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet better than nothing and her spirits improved
after talking however of the weather and bath and the concert their conversation began to flag and so little was said at last that she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not he seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit with a little smile a little glow he said  i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme
i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the time  she assured him that she had not
it was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he passed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still too painful but in a moment half smiling again added the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful
when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery  certainly i could have none
but it appearsi should hope it would be a very happy match
there are on both sides good principles and good temper  yes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think ends the resemblance
with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it
they have no difficulties to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays
the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughters comfort
all this is much very much in favour of their happiness more than perhaps  he stopped
a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening annes cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground
after clearing his throat however he proceeded thus  i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity and in a point no less essential than mind
i regard louisa musgrove as a very amiable sweettempered girl and not deficient in understanding but benwick is something more
he is a clever man a reading man and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise
had it been the effect of gratitude had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him it would have been another thing
but i have no reason to suppose it so
it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me
a man like him in his situation
with a heart pierced wounded almost broken
fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her was indeed attachment
a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman
he ought not he does not  either from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered or from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered and in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless slam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused and beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things in a moment
it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject and yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking and having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated so far as to say  you were a good while at lyme i think  about a fortnight
i could not leave it till louisas doing well was quite ascertained
i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace
it had been my doing solely mine
she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak
the country round lyme is very fine
i walked and rode a great deal and the more i saw the more i found to admire  i should very much like to see lyme again said anne
indeed
i should not have supposed that you could have found anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling
the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits
i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been strong disgust  the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure
one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was by no means the case at lyme
we were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment
so much novelty and beauty
i have travelled so little that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty at lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable  as she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting
lady dalrymple lady dalrymple was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her
lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot and colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant advanced into the room
the others joined them and it was a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included
she was divided from captain wentworth
their interesting almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on
she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings towards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations
she was in good humour with all
she had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one as being less happy than herself
the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back from the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw that he was gone
she was just in time to see him turn into the concert room
he was gone he had disappeared she felt a moments regret
but they should meet again
he would look for her he would find her out before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was as well to be asunder
she was in need of a little interval for recollection  upon lady russells appearance soon afterwards the whole party was collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves and proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence in their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers and disturb as many people as they could
very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in
elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach and annebut it would be an insult to the nature of annes felicity to draw any comparison between it and her sisters the origin of one all selfish vanity of the other all generous attachment
anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room
her happiness was from within
her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed but she knew nothing about it
she was thinking only of the last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took a hasty range over it
his choice of subjects his expressions and still more his manner and look had been such as she could see in only one light
his opinion of louisa musgroves inferiority an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder at captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment sentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness of the past
yes some share of the tenderness of the past
she could not contemplate the change as implying less
he must love her
these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him without even trying to discern him
when their places were determined on and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way
the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manuvred so well with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her
miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object of colonel walliss gallantry was quite contented
annes mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening it was just occupation enough she had feelings for the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific and patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better at least during the first act
towards the close of it in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained the words of the song to mr elliot
they had a concert bill between them
this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words for certainly the sense of an italian lovesong must not be talked of but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend to understand the language
i am a very poor italian scholar  yes yes i see you are
i see you know nothing of the matter
you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english
you need not say anything more of your ignorance
here is complete proof  i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient  i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman  for shame
for shame
this is too much flattery
i forget what we are to have next turning to the bill
perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of  indeed
how so
you can have been acquainted with it only since i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family  i knew you by report long before you came to bath
i had heard you described by those who knew you intimately
i have been acquainted with you by character many years
your person your disposition accomplishments manner they were all present to me  mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery
to have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people is irresistible and anne was all curiosity
she wondered and questioned him eagerly but in vain
he delighted in being asked but he would not tell
no no some time or other perhaps but not now
he would mention no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact
he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited the warmest curiosity to know her  anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworths brother
he might have been in mr elliots company but she had not courage to ask the question
the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me
very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change  such she believed were his words but scarcely had she received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial
her father and lady dalrymple were speaking
a welllooking man said sir walter a very welllooking man  a very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple
more air than one often sees in bath
irish i dare say  no i just know his name
a bowing acquaintance
wentworth captain wentworth of the navy
his sister married my tenant in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch  before sir walter had reached this point annes eyes had caught the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance
as her eyes fell on him his seemed to be withdrawn from her
it had that appearance
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she dared observe he did not look again but the performance was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward
when she could give another glance he had moved away
he could not have come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in but she would rather have caught his eye
mr elliots speech too distressed her
she had no longer any inclination to talk to him
she wished him not so near her
the first act was over
now she hoped for some beneficial change and after a period of nothingsaying amongst the party some of them did decide on going in quest of tea
anne was one of the few who did not choose to move
she remained in her seat and so did lady russell but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean whatever she might feel on lady russells account to shrink from conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity
she was persuaded by lady russells countenance that she had seen him
he did not come however
anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance but he never came
the anxious interval wore away unproductively
the others returned the room filled again benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed
to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth once more without the interchange of one friendly look
in resettling themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her
colonel wallis declined sitting down again and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals and a little scheming of her own anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before much more within reach of a passerby
she could not do so without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles but still she did it and not with much happier effect though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed
such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth was again in sight
she saw him not far off
he saw her too yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her
she felt that something must be the matter
the change was indubitable
the difference between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room was strikingly great
why was it
she thought of her father of lady russell
could there have been any unpleasant glances
he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over
anne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance improved and he replied again with almost a smile
they talked for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round
it came from mr elliot
he begged her pardon but she must be applied to to explain italian again
miss carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung
anne could not refuse but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit
a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell
he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast as he could  is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging
no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for and he was gone directly
jealousy of mr elliot
it was the only intelligible motive
captain wentworth jealous of her affection
could she have believed it a week ago three hours ago
for a moment the gratification was exquisite
but alas
there were very different thoughts to succeed
how was such jealousy to be quieted
how was the truth to reach him
how in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations would he ever learn of her real sentiments
it was misery to think of mr elliots attentions
their evil was incalculable
anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid mr elliot was almost a first object
she felt a great deal of goodwill towards him
in spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion
she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation by his own sentiments by his early prepossession
it was altogether very extraordinary flattering but painful
there was much to regret
how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case was not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad her affection would be his for ever
their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation
prettier musings of highwrought love and eternal constancy could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings
it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way
she was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her though it had been an appointment
an account of the concert was immediately claimed and annes recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it
all that she could tell she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company
everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath was well know by name to mrs smith
the little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed
they never miss a concert  yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were in the room  the ibbotsons were they there
and the two new beauties with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them  i do not know
i do not think they were  old lady mary maclean
i need not ask after her
she never misses i know and you must have seen her
she must have been in your own circle for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur round the orchestra of course  no that was what i dreaded
it would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect
but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little  oh
you saw enough for your own amusement
i can understand
there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd and this you had
you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond  but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about that the object only had been deficient
no no you were better employed
you need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening
i see it in your eye
i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to
in the intervals of the concert it was conversation  anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye  yes i do
your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together  a blush overspread annes cheeks
she could say nothing
and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning
it is really very good of you to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time  anne heard nothing of this
she was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friends penetration unable to imagine how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her
after another short silence  pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me
does he know that i am in bath  mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised
a moments reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under
she caught it instantaneously and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot  i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely but it seems worn out now
it is a great while since we met  i was not at all aware of this
you never mentioned it before
had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you  to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have
i want you to talk about me to mr elliot
i want your interest with him
he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself of course it is done  i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case
i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion
you must consider me only as mr elliots relation
if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me  mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said  i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon
i ought to have waited for official information
but now my dear miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak
next week
to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliots good fortune  no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next
i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week
i am not going to marry mr elliot
i should like to know why you imagine i am  mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head and exclaimed  now how i do wish i understood you
how i do wish i knew what you were at
i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel when the right moment occurs
till it does come you know we women never mean to have anybody
it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers
but why should you be cruel
let me plead for mypresent friend i cannot call him but for my former friend
where can you look for a more suitable match
where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man
let me recommend mr elliot
i am sure you hear nothing but good of him from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis  my dear mrs smith mr elliots wife has not been dead much above half a year
he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one  oh
if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him
do not forget me when you are married thats all
let him know me to be a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps
ninetynine out of a hundred would do the same
of course he cannot be aware of the importance to me
well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy
mr elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman
your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been
you are safe in all worldly matters and safe in his character
he will not be led astray he will not be misled by others to his ruin  no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin
he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open to dangerous impressions
i consider him with great respect
i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation to do otherwise
but i have not known him long and he is not a man i think to be known intimately soon
will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me
surely this must be calm enough
and upon my word he is nothing to me
should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him
i assure you i shall not
i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that  she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much but less would hardly have been sufficient
mrs smith would hardly have believed so soon in mr elliots failure but from the perception of there being a somebody else
as it was she instantly submitted and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have received the idea or from whom she could have heard it
do tell me how it first came into your head  it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way
but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago  and has it indeed been spoken of  did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday  no
was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid
i observed no one in particular  it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who bythebye had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way to let you in
she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot
she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority
she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history the whole history repeated anne laughing
she could not make a very long history i think of one such little article of unfounded news  mrs smith said nothing
but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that i could
shall i mention to him your being in bath
shall i take any message  no i thank you no certainly not
in the warmth of the moment and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances but not now
no i thank you i have nothing to trouble you with  i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years  i did  not before he was married i suppose  yes he was not married when i knew him first  andwere you much acquainted  intimately  indeed
then do tell me what he was at that time of life
i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man
was he at all such as he appears now  i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smiths answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity
they were both silent mrs smith very thoughtful
at last  i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do
i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you
there were many things to be taken into the account
one hates to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief
even the smooth surface of familyunion seems worth preserving though there may be nothing durable beneath
however i have determined i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted with mr elliots real character
though i fully believe that at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him there is no saying what may happen
you might some time or other be differently affected towards him
hear the truth therefore now while you are unprejudiced
mr elliot is a man without heart or conscience a designing wary coldblooded being who thinks only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character
he has no feeling for others
those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction
he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion
oh
he is black at heart hollow and black  annes astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added  my expressions startle you
you must allow for an injured angry woman
but i will try to command myself
i will not abuse him
i will only tell you what i have found him
facts shall speak
he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself
the intimacy had been formed before our marriage
i found them most intimate friends and i too became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained the highest opinion of him
at nineteen you know one does not think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost always together
we were principally in town living in very good style
he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman
he had always a home with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother
my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse was open to him i know that he often assisted him  this must have been about that very period of mr elliots life said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity
it must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister
i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times
it seemed to announce a different sort of man  i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith
he had been introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him but i heard him speak of them for ever
i know he was invited and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go
i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time
i was privy to all the fors and againsts i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer any question you may wish to put  nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her
i have always understood they were not a happy couple
but i should like to know why at that time of his life he should slight my fathers acquaintance as he did
my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him
why did mr elliot draw back  mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life had one object in view to make his fortune and by a rather quicker process than the law
he was determined to make it by marriage
he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities and invitations were designing a match between the heir and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence
that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you
he told me the whole story
he had no concealments with me
it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father and sister
he described one miss elliot and i thought very affectionately of the other  perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot  to be sure i did very often
i used to boast of my own anne elliot and vouch for your being a very different creature from  she checked herself just in time
this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night cried anne
this explains it
i found he had been used to hear of me
i could not comprehend how
what wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned
how sure to be mistaken
but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you
mr elliot married then completely for money
the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes to his character  mrs smith hesitated a little here
oh
those things are too common
when one lives in the world a man or womans marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought
i was very young and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless gay set without any strict rules of conduct
we lived for enjoyment
i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible in what mr elliot was doing
to do the best for himself passed as a duty  but was not she a very low woman  yes which i objected to but he would not regard
money money was all that he wanted
her father was a grazier her grandfather had been a butcher but that was all nothing
she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliots company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth
all his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself
depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it
his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt
i have often heard him declare that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say on that subject
it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof  indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne
you have asserted nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago
this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe
i am more curious to know why he should be so different now  but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet  anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired
the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said  this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him
the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine
but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed
here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy
i have now another motive for being glad that i can produce it  this was the letter directed to charles smith esq
tunbridge wells and dated from london as far back as july    dear smith  i have received yours
your kindness almost overpowers me
i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have lived threeandtwenty years in the world and have seen none like it
at present believe me i have no need of your services being in cash again
give me joy i have got rid of sir walter and miss
they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer
the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again he is quite fool enough
if he does however they will leave me in peace which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion
he is worse than last year
i wish i had any name but elliot
i am sick of it
the name of walter i can drop thank god
and i desire you will never insult me with my second w again meaning for the rest of my life to be only yours truly  wm
elliot   such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said  the language i know is highly disrespectful
though i have forgot the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning
but it shows you the man
mark his professions to my poor husband
can any thing be stronger  anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father
she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say  thank you
this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing you were saying
but why be acquainted with us now  i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling
can you really  yes
i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago and i will shew him as he is now
i cannot produce written proof again but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what he is now wanting and what he is now doing
he is no hypocrite now
he truly wants to marry you
his present attentions to your family are very sincere quite from the heart
i will give you my authority his friend colonel wallis  colonel wallis
you are acquainted with him  no
it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence
the stream is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away
mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her
she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me
on monday evening my good friend mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings
when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was not romancing so much as you supposed  my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient
this will not do
mr elliots having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father
that was all prior to my coming to bath
i found them on the most friendly terms when i arrived  i know you did i know it all perfectly but  indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information in such a line
facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left  only give me a hearing
you will soon be able to judge of the general credit due by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm
nobody supposes that you were his first inducement
he had seen you indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without knowing it to be you
so says my historian at least
is this true
did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west to use her own words without knowing it to be you  he certainly did
so far it is very true
at lyme
i happened to be at lyme  well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted
he saw you then at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive in his visits there
but there was another and an earlier which i will now explain
if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me
my account states that your sisters friend the lady now staying with you whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation and manner as to give a general idea among sir walters acquaintance of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger  here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say and she continued  this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail
now you are to understand that time had worked a very material change in mr elliots opinions as to the value of a baronetcy
upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man
having long had as much money as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to
i thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling
he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william
you may guess therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady if he found it material
this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could
he was to be introduced and mrs wallis was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced
mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven as you know and readmitted into the family and there it was his constant object and his only object till your arrival added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay
he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject
you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do  yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine
there is always something offensive in the details of cunning
the manuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me
i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied
i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared
i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not  lessening i understand replied mrs smith
he thinks mrs clay afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence
but since he must be absent some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence
mrs wallis has an amusing idea as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay
a scheme worthy of mrs walliss understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it
why to be sure maam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart is a very strenuous opposer of sir walters making a second match
she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through mrs walliss recommendation  i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little thoughtfulness
it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do
my line of conduct will be more direct
mr elliot is evidently a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness  but mr elliot was not done with
mrs smith had been carried away from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion
she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliots marriage they had been as before always together and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune
mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance
from his wifes account of him she could discern mr smith to have been a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him led by him and probably despised by him
mr elliot raised by his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself for with all his selfindulgence he had become a prudent man and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friends probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths accordingly had been ruined
the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it
they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliots had better not be tried but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known
with a confidence in mr elliots regard more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to without corresponding indignation
anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hardhearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her
it was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime could have been worse
she had a great deal to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence
anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friends usual state of mind
there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation
she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures and this property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively rich
but there was nobody to stir in it
mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money
she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law
this was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means
to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard to bear
it was on this point that she had hoped to engage annes good offices with mr elliot
she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest annes feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliots character would allow when annes refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything and while it took from her the newformed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way
after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smiths having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation
she had seemed to recommend and praise him  my dear was mrs smiths reply there was nothing else to be done
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him than if he had been your husband
my heart bled for you as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless
he was very unkind to his first wife
they were wretched together
but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her
i was willing to hope that you must fare better  anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed
it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell
and under such a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had disclosed all too late
it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved
anne went home to think over all that she had heard
in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him
he stood as opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed
pity for him was all over
but this was the only point of relief
in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend
she was concerned for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them
she was most thankful for her own knowledge of him
she had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was a reward indeed springing from it
mrs smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done
could the knowledge have been extended through her family
but this was a vain idea
she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her and having done her best wait the event with as much composure as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself
she found on reaching home that she had as she intended escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening
i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints so mrs clay says at least  indeed i do say it
i never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation
poor man
i was really in pain for him for your hardhearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty  oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentlemans hints
however when i found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and sir walter together
they appear to so much advantage in company with each other
each behaving so pleasantly
mr elliot looking up with so much respect  quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however to turn her eyes towards anne
exactly like father and son
dear miss elliot may i not say father and son  oh
i lay no embargo on any bodys words
if you will have such ideas
but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men  my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence
well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him
i did invite him you know
i sent him away with smiles
when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park for the whole day tomorrow i had compassion on him  anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object
it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise
to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her
she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity in everything
his attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments
she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side
it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along
she was accordingly more guarded and more cool than she had been the night before
he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousins vanity he found at least that it was not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the toocommanding claims of the others
he little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable
she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part of two days
he was invited again to camden place the very evening of his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain
it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort
it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them
mrs clays selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliots subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it
on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion
she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk of spending the morning in rivers street
very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love
oh
you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me and pretend i have read it through
i really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out
lady russell quite bores one with her new publications
you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night
i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her at the concert
something so formal and arrang in her air
and she sits so upright
my best love of course  and mine added sir walter
kindest regards
and you may say that i mean to call upon her soon
make a civil message but i shall only leave my card
morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little
if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately  while her father spoke there was a knock at the door
who could it be
anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off
after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room
surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well
they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were at the white hart
so much was pretty soon understood but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into the other drawingroom and regaling themselves with her admiration anne could not draw upon charless brain for a regular history of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of
she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta and captain harville beside their two selves
he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding
the scheme had received its first impulse by captain harvilles wanting to come to bath on business
he had begun to talk of it a week ago and by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed coming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end
but then it had been taken up by his father and mother
his mother had some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy weddingclothes for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being his mothers party that everything might be comfortable and easy to captain harville and he and mary were included in it by way of general convenience
they had arrived late the night before
mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross
annes only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough for henriettas weddingclothes to be talked of
she had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that very recently since marys last letter to herself charles hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years and that on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question the two families had consented to the young peoples wishes and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months quite as soon as louisas
and a very good living it was charles added only fiveandtwenty miles from uppercross and in a very fine country fine part of dorsetshire
in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation
not that he will value it as he ought he observed charles is too cool about sporting
thats the worst of him  i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the otherthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort
i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both  oh
yes
my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer but he has no other fault to find
money you know coming down with moneytwo daughters at onceit cannot be a very agreeable operation and it streightens him as to many things
however i do not mean to say they have not a right to it
it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me
mary does not above half like henriettas match
she never did you know
but she does not do him justice nor think enough about winthrop
i cannot make her attend to the value of the property
it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now  such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne should be happy in their childrens marriages
they do everything to confer happiness i am sure
what a blessing to young people to be in such hands
your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery both in young and old
i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now  he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing or dancing it is quite different
if one happens only to shut the door a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dabchick in the water and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her all day long  anne could not help laughing
that cannot be much to your taste i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man  to be sure he is
nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself
i have a great value for benwick and when one can but get him to talk he has plenty to say
his reading has done him no harm for he has fought as well as read
he is a brave fellow
i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before
we had a famous setto at rathunting all the morning in my fathers great barns and he played his part so well that i have liked him the better ever since  here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charless following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none of the illwill of envy in it
she would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs
the visit passed off altogether in high good humour
mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her motherinlaws carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her
she had no demands on her father or sister and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawingrooms
elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal
she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch
it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better and then elizabeth was happy again
these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does did not even ask her own sisters family though they were here a month and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove put her quite out of her way
i am sure she would rather not come she cannot feel easy with us
i will ask them all for an evening that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat
they have not seen two such drawing rooms before
they will be delighted to come tomorrow evening
it shall be a regular party small but most elegant and this satisfied elizabeth and when the invitation was given to the two present and promised for the absent mary was as completely satisfied
she was particularly asked to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not have received a more gratifying attention
miss elliot was to have the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her and henrietta directly
her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present
they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes but anne convinced herself that a days delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an eagerness of goodwill which many associations contributed to form
they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and anne had the kindest welcome from each
henrietta was exactly in that state of recentlyimproved views of freshformed happiness which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all and mrs musgroves real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress
it was a heartiness and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more from the sad want of such blessings at home
she was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance and on charless leaving them together was listening to mrs musgroves history of louisa and to henriettas of herself giving opinions on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying to convince her that she was not illused by anybody which mary well amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have her moments of imagining
a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected
a large party in an hotel ensured a quickchanging unsettled scene
one five minutes brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there half an hour when their diningroom spacious as it was seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with captains harville and wentworth
the appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment
it was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again
their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had hastened him away from the concert room still governed
he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation
she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependencesurely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts must understand each other ere long
we are not boy and girl to be captiously irritable misled by every moments inadvertence and wantonly playing with our own happiness and yet a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company with each other under their present circumstances could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind
anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her
i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now
they seemed deep in talk
who is it
come and tell me
good heavens
i recollect
it is mr elliot himself  no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you
he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back till tomorrow  as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was
mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir and tried to be cool and unconcerned
her distress returned however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves quite in the secret
it was evident that the report concerning her had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther
do come anne cried mary come and look yourself
you will be too late if you do not make haste
they are parting they are shaking hands
he is turning away
not know mr elliot indeed
you seem to have forgot all about lyme  to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move quietly to the window
she was just in time to ascertain that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot certainly
he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well
the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with  well mother i have done something for you that you will like
i have been to the theatre and secured a box for tomorrow night
ant i a good boy
i know you love a play and there is room for us all
it holds nine
i have engaged captain wentworth
anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure
we all like a play
have not i done well mother  mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming  good heavens charles
how can you think of such a thing
take a box for tomorrow night
have you forgot that we are engaged to camden place tomorrow night
and that we were most particularly asked to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them
how can you be so forgetful  phoo
phoo replied charles whats an evening party
never worth remembering
your father might have asked us to dinner i think if he had wanted to see us
you may do as you like but i shall go to the play  oh
charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do when you promised to go  no i did not promise
i only smirked and bowed and said the word happy there was no promise  but you must go charles
it would be unpardonable to fail
we were asked on purpose to be introduced
there was always such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves
nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately
we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with
every attention is due to mr elliot
consider my fathers heir the future representative of the family  dont talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles
i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun
if i would not go for the sake of your father i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir
what is mr elliot to me the careless expression was life to anne who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from charles to herself
charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play without her
mrs musgrove interposed
we had better put it off
charles you had much better go back and change the box for tuesday
it would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her fathers and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play if miss anne could not be with us  anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying  if it depended only on my inclination maam the party at home excepting on marys account would not be the smallest impediment
i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy to change it for a play and with you
but it had better not be attempted perhaps she had spoken it but she trembled when it was done conscious that her words were listened to and daring not even to try to observe their effect
it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife by persisting that he would go to the play tomorrow if nobody else would
captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fireplace probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less barefaced design by anne
you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy the evening parties of the place  oh
no
the usual character of them has nothing for me
i am no cardplayer  you were not formerly i know
you did not use to like cards but time makes many changes  i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction
after waiting a few moments he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling it is a period indeed
eight years and a half is a period  whether he would have proceeded farther was left to annes imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in
they were obliged to move
anne talked of being perfectly ready and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity her
their preparations however were stopped short
alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general chill
anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same
the comfort the freedom the gaiety of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister
how mortifying to feel that it was so
her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular
captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before
she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once
elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure
the sequel explained it
after the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves
tomorrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and one card more decidedly for captain wentworth
the truth was that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his
the past was nothing
the present was that captain wentworth would move about well in her drawingroom
the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared
the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out but not to anne
she could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance
she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement for all the insolence of the past
her spirits sank
he held the card in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it
only think of elizabeths including everybody whispered mary very audibly
i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted
you see he cannot put the card out of his hand  anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her
the party separated
the gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while anne belonged to them
she was earnestly begged to return and dine and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose
promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrows party the frequent enumeration of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the neverending question of whether captain wentworth would come or not
they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together
she generally thought he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings
she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her there was guilt in mrs clays face as she listened
it was transient cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on sir walter
she exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature  oh
dear
very true
only think miss elliot to my great surprise i met with mr elliot in bath street
i was never more astonished
he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard
he had been prevented setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return
he wanted to know how early he might be admitted tomorrow
he was full of tomorrow and it is very evident that i have been full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head       one day only had passed since annes conversation with mrs smith but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by mr elliots conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street
she had promised to be with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner
her faith was plighted and mr elliots character like the sultaness scheherazades head must live another day
she could not keep her appointment punctually however the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain on her friends account and felt it very much on her own before she was able to attempt the walk
when she reached the white hart and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive
the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned
she had only to submit sit down be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed
there was no delay no waste of time
she was deep in the happiness of such misery or the misery of such happiness instantly
two minutes after her entering the room captain wentworth said  we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials  materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing
mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest daughters engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper
anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style of openhearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give could be properly interesting only to the principals
mrs croft was attending with great goodhumour and whenever she spoke at all it was very sensibly
anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much selfoccupied to hear
and so maam all these thing considered said mrs musgrove in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once and make the best of it as many others have done before them
at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement  that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft
i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be involved in a long engagement
i always think that no mutual  oh
dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her finish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people as a long engagement
it is what i always protested against for my children
it is all very well i used to say for young people to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement  yes dear maam said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long
to begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents should prevent as far as they can  anne found an unexpected interest here
she felt its application to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table captain wentworths pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one quick conscious look at her
the two ladies continued to talk to reurge the same admitted truths and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear her mind was in confusion
captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood
he looked at her with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed come to me i have something to say and the unaffected easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was strongly enforced the invitation
she roused herself and went to him
the window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer to captain wentworths table not very near
as she joined him captain harvilles countenance reassumed the serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character
look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying a small miniature painting do you know who that is  certainly captain benwick  yes and you may guess who it is for
but in a deep tone it was not done for her
miss elliot do you remember our walking together at lyme and grieving for him
i little thought thenbut no matter
this was drawn at the cape
he met with a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another
it was a commission to me
but who else was there to employ
i hope i can allow for him
i am not sorry indeed to make it over to another
he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth he is writing about it now and with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding poor fanny
she would not have forgotten him so soon  no replied anne in a low feeling voice
that i can easily believe  it was not in her nature
she doted on him  it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved  captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that for your sex and she answered the question smiling also yes
we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us
it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit
we cannot help ourselves
we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us
you are forced on exertion
you have always a profession pursuits business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions  granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply to benwick
he has not been forced upon any exertion
the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since  true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall we say now captain harville
if the change be not from outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature mans nature which has done the business for captain benwick  no no it is not mans nature
i will not allow it to be more mans nature than womans to be inconstant and forget those they do love or have loved
i believe the reverse
i believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage and riding out the heaviest weather  your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender
man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments
nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise
you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with
you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship
your home country friends all quitted
neither time nor health nor life to be called your own
it would be hard indeed with a faltering voice if womans feelings were to be added to all this  we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworths hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room
it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught
have you finished your letter said captain harville
not quite a few lines more
i shall have done in five minutes  there is no hurry on my side
i am only ready whenever you are
i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied and want for nothing
no hurry for a signal at all
well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point
no man and woman would probably
but let me observe that all histories are against youall stories prose and verse
if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon womans inconstancy
songs and proverbs all talk of womans fickleness
but perhaps you will say these were all written by men  perhaps i shall
yes yes if you please no reference to examples in books
men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story
education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has been in their hands
i will not allow books to prove anything  but how shall we prove anything  we never shall
we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point
it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof
we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said  ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again when coming back after a twelvemonths absence perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still
if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence
i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own with emotion
oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you
god forbid that i should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellowcreatures
i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman
no i believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives
i believe you equal to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance so long asif i may be allowed the expressionso long as you have an object
i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you
all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone  she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed
you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand on her arm quite affectionately
there is no quarrelling with you
and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied  their attention was called towards the others
mrs croft was taking leave
here frederick you and i part company i believe said she
i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend
tonight we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party turning to anne
we had your sisters card yesterday and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves  captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either could not or would not answer fully
yes said he very true here we separate but harville and i shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready i am in half a minute
i know you will not be sorry to be off
i shall be at your service in half a minute  mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried agitated air which shewed impatience to be gone
anne knew not how to understand it
she had the kindest good morning god bless you from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look
he had passed out of the room without a look
she had only time however to move closer to the table where he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning the door opened it was himself
he begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it the work of an instant
the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost beyond expression
the letter with a direction hardly legible to miss a e was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily
while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick he had been also addressing her
on the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her
anything was possible anything might be defied rather than suspense
mrs musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection she must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written her eyes devoured the following words  i can listen no longer in silence
i must speak to you by such means as are within my reach
you pierce my soul
i am half agony half hope
tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings are gone for ever
i offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years and a half ago
dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman that his love has an earlier death
i have loved none but you
unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant
you alone have brought me to bath
for you alone i think and plan
have you not seen this
can you fail to have understood my wishes
i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine
i can hardly write
i am every instant hearing something which overpowers me
you sink your voice but i can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others
too good too excellent creature
you do us justice indeed
you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men
believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in   f w   i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither or follow your party as soon as possible
a word a look will be enough to decide whether i enter your fathers house this evening or never   such a letter was not to be soon recovered from
half an hours solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity
every moment rather brought fresh agitation
it was overpowering happiness
and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation charles mary and henrietta all came in
the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more
she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself
they could then see that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not stir without her for the world
this was dreadful
would they only have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting and in desperation she said she would go home
by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening
i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself
charles ring and order a chair
she must not walk  but the chair would never do
worse than all
to lose the possibility of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him could not be borne
the chair was earnestly protested against and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at night
anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said  i am afraid maam that it is not perfectly understood
pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening
i am afraid there had been some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both  oh
my dear it is quite understood i give you my word
captain harville has no thought but of going  do you think so
but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry
will you promise me to mention it when you see them again
you will see them both this morning i dare say
do promise me  to be sure i will if you wish it
charles if you see captain harville anywhere remember to give miss annes message
but indeed my dear you need not be uneasy
captain harville holds himself quite engaged ill answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say  anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity
it could not be very lasting however
even if he did not come to camden place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by captain harville
another momentary vexation occurred
charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him
this was almost cruel
but she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmiths to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent
they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight of captain wentworth
he joined them but as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked
anne could command herself enough to receive that look and not repulsively
the cheeks which had been pale now glowed and the movements which had hesitated were decided
he walked by her side
presently struck by a sudden thought charles said  captain wentworth which way are you going
only to gay street or farther up the town  i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised
are you going as high as belmont
are you going near camden place
because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give anne your arm to her fathers door
she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and i ought to be at that fellows in the market place
he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance
by his description a good deal like the second size doublebarrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop  there could not be an objection
there could be only the most proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture
in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again and the other two proceeding together and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow
there they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything but which had been followed by so many many years of division and estrangement
there they returned again into the past more exquisitely happy perhaps in their reunion than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed in a knowledge of each others character truth and attachment more equal to act more justified in acting
and there as they slowly paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers flirting girls nor nurserymaids and children they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest
all the little variations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end
she had not mistaken him
jealousy of mr elliot had been the retarding weight the doubt the torment
that had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do in the last fourandtwenty hours
it had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings
of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified
he persisted in having loved none but her
she had never been supplanted
he never even believed himself to see her equal
thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge that he had been constant unconsciously nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it to be done
he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been a sufferer from them
her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun to understand himself
at lyme he had received lessons of more than one sort
the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harvilles had fixed her superiority
in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care for louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection which followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which louisas could so ill bear a comparison or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own
there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of selfwill between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind
there he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun to deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way
from that period his penance had become severe
he had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of louisas accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty
i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man
that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment
i was startled and shocked
to a degree i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect that others might have felt the sameher own family nay perhaps herselfi was no longer at my own disposal
i was hers in honour if she wished it
i had been unguarded
i had not thought seriously on this subject before
i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other ill effects
i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences  he found too late in short that he had entangled himself and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed
it determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere
he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore to his brothers meaning after a while to return to kellynch and act as circumstances might require
i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy
i could have no other pleasure
i deserved none
he enquired after you very particularly asked even if you were personally altered little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter  anne smiled and let it pass
it was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach
it is something for a woman to be assured in her eightandtwentieth year that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be the result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment
he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick
here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself i could do something
but to be waiting so long in inaction and waiting only for evil had been dreadful
within the first five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was
was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come
and to arrive with some degree of hope
you were single
it was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement happened to be mine
i could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help often saying was this for me  their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said but the concert still more
that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments
the moment of her stepping forward in the octagon room to speak to him the moment of mr elliots appearing and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on with energy
to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be my wellwishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match
to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you
even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent to consider what powerful supports would be his
was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared
how could i look on without agony
was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once donewas it not all against me  you should have distinguished replied anne
you should not have suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different
if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk
when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called in aid here
in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk would have been incurred and all duty violated  perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not
i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired of your character
i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year
i could think of you only as one who had yielded who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me
i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery
i had no reason to believe her of less authority now
the force of habit was to be added  i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this  no no
your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give
i left you in this belief and yet i was determined to see you again
my spirits rallied with the morning and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here  at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house could have conceived
all the surprise and suspense and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation she reentered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last
an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such highwrought felicity and she went to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment
the evening came the drawingrooms were lighted up the company assembled
it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found an evening shorter
glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her
mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him
the wallises she had amusement in understanding them
lady dalrymple and miss carteretthey would soon be innoxious cousins to her
she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister
with the musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville the kindhearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal and with captain wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there
it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said  i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now
to me she was in the place of a parent
do not mistake me however
i am not saying that she did not err in her advice
it was perhaps one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance of tolerable similarity give such advice
but i mean that i was right in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up because i should have suffered in my conscience
i have now as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a womans portion  he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her replied as if in cool deliberation  not yet
but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time
i trust to being in charity with her soon
but i too have been thinking over the past and a question has suggested itself whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady
my own self
tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter
would you in short have renewed the engagement then  would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough
good god he cried you would
it is not that i did not think of it or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success but i was proud too proud to ask again
i did not understand you
i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice
this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself
six years of separation and suffering might have been spared
it is a sort of pain too which is new to me
i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that i enjoyed
i have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards
like other great men under reverses he added with a smile
i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune
i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve       who can be in doubt of what followed
when any two young people take it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent or ever so little likely to be necessary to each others ultimate comfort
this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition
they might in fact have borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth
sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned
captain wentworth with fiveandtwenty thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him was no longer nobody
he was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter
sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for her
on the contrary when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight and eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank and all this assisted by his wellsounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen with a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour
the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was lady russell
anne knew that lady russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with and do justice to captain wentworth
this however was what lady russell had now to do
she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each that because captain wentworths manners had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because mr elliots manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and wellregulated mind
there was nothing less for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes
there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment of character a natural penetration in short which no experience in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend
but she was a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible and welljudging her first was to see anne happy
she loved anne better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child
of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance
it was creditable to have a sister married and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn and as her own sister must be better than her husbands sisters it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than either captain benwick or charles hayter
she had something to suffer perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation
anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne
it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation for a change is not very probable there
she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him
the news of his cousin annes engagement burst on mr elliot most unexpectedly
it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness which a soninlaws rights would have given
but though discomfited and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment
he soon quitted bath and on mrs clays quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established under his protection in london it was evident how double a game he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman at least
mrs clays affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young mans sake the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter
she has abilities however as well as affections and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of sir william
it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of their deception in her
they had their great cousins to be sure to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn is but a state of half enjoyment
anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russells meaning to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value
there she felt her own inferiority very keenly
the disproportion in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moments regret but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity
she had but two friends in the world to add to his list lady russell and mrs smith
to those however he was very well disposed to attach himself
lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions he could now value from his heart
while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently
her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves and their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend secured her two
she was their earliest visitor in their settled life and captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering her husbands property in the west indies by writing for her acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend fully requited the services which she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife
mrs smiths enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends to be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity
she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy and yet be happy
her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits as her friend annes was in the warmth of her heart
anne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it in captain wentworths affection
his profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine
she gloried in being a sailors wife but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance

    there is an illustrated edition of this title which may viewed at ebook     cover     pride and prejudice  by jane austen  contents    chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter     chapter      chapter         it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in       possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be       on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well       fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is       considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their       daughters
my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you       heard that netherfield park is let at last        mr bennet replied that he had not
but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and       she told me all about it        mr bennet made no answer
do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife       impatiently
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it        this was invitation enough
why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is       taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england       that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the       place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr       morris immediately that he is to take possession before       michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by       the end of next week        what is his name        bingley        is he married or single        oh
single my dear to be sure
a single man of large fortune       four or five thousand a year
what a fine thing for our girls        how so
how can it affect them        my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so       tiresome
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of       them        is that his design in settling here        design
nonsense how can you talk so
but it is very likely       that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you       must visit him as soon as he comes        i see no occasion for that
you and the girls may go or you may       send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for       as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you       the best of the party        my dear you flatter me
i certainly have had my share of       beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now
when a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over       thinking of her own beauty        in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of        but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he       comes into the neighbourhood        it is more than i engage for i assure you        but consider your daughters
only think what an establishment it       would be for one of them
sir william and lady lucas are       determined to go merely on that account for in general you       know they visit no newcomers
indeed you must go for it will be       impossible for us to visit him if you do not        you are over scrupulous surely
i dare say mr bingley will be       very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to       assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he       chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my       little lizzy        i desire you will do no such thing
lizzy is not a bit better       than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as       jane nor half so goodhumoured as lydia
but you are always       giving her the preference        they have none of them much to recommend them replied he       they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has       something more of quickness than her sisters        mr
bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way
you take delight in vexing me
you have no compassion on my poor       nerves        you mistake me my dear
i have a high respect for your nerves
they are my old friends
i have heard you mention them with       consideration these twenty years at least        ah you do not know what i suffer        but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men       of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood        it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you       will not visit them        depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will       visit them all        mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour       reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty       years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his       character
her mind was less difficult to develop
she was a       woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain       temper
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its       solace was visiting and news
chapter         mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr       bingley
he had always intended to visit him though to the last       always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the       evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it
it       was then disclosed in the following manner
observing his second       daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her       with        i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy        we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her       mother resentfully since we are not to visit        but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him       at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him        i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing
she has two       nieces of her own
she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i       have no opinion of her        no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that       you do not depend on her serving you        mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain       herself began scolding one of her daughters
dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake
have a little       compassion on my nerves
you tear them to pieces        kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she       times them ill        i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully
when is your next ball to be lizzy        tomorrow fortnight        aye so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come       back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to       introduce him for she will not know him herself        then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and       introduce mr bingley to her        impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted       with him myself how can you be so teasing        i honour your circumspection
a fortnights acquaintance is       certainly very little
one cannot know what a man really is by       the end of a fortnight
but if we do not venture somebody else       will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their       chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness       if you decline the office i will take it on myself        the girls stared at their father
mrs bennet said only       nonsense nonsense        what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he
do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that       is laid on them as nonsense
i cannot quite agree with you       there
what say you mary
for you are a young lady of deep       reflection i know and read great books and make extracts        mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return       to mr bingley        i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so       before
if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not       have called on him
it is very unlucky but as i have actually       paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now        the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of       mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first       tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she       had expected all the while
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet
but i knew i should       persuade you at last
i was sure you loved your girls too well to       neglect such an acquaintance
well how pleased i am
and it is       such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and       never said a word about it till now        now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr       bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the       raptures of his wife
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the       door was shut
i do not know how you will ever make him amends       for his kindness or me either for that matter
at our time of       life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new       acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do       anything
lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare       say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball        oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the       youngest im the tallest        the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he       would return mr bennets visit and determining when they should       ask him to dinner
chapter         not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her       five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw       from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley
they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions       ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the       skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the       secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas
her       report was highly favourable
sir william had been delighted with       him
he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely       agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next       assembly with a large party
nothing could be more delightful
to       be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love       and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained
if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at       netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the       others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for        in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat       about ten minutes with him in his library
he had entertained       hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose       beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father
the ladies       were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of       ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and       rode a black horse
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and       already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do       credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred       it all
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day       and consequently unable to accept the honour of their       invitation etc
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted
she could       not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his       arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be       always flying about from one place to another and never settled       at netherfield as he ought to be
lady lucas quieted her fears a       little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to       get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that       mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with       him to the assembly
the girls grieved over such a number of       ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing       that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from       london his five sisters and a cousin
and when the party entered       the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr       bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another       young man
mr bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant       countenance and easy unaffected manners
his sisters were fine       women with an air of decided fashion
his brotherinlaw mr       hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon       drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome       features noble mien and the report which was in general       circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having       ten thousand a year
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine       figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than       mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about       half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned       the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to       be above his company and above being pleased and not all his       large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most       forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be       compared with his friend
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the       principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved       danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and       talked of giving one himself at netherfield
such amiable       qualities must speak for themselves
what a contrast between him       and his friend
mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and       once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other       lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the       room speaking occasionally to one of his own party
his       character was decided
he was the proudest most disagreeable man       in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there       again
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet       whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into       particular resentment by his having slighted one of her       daughters
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen       to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr       darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a       conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance       for a few minutes to press his friend to join it
come darcy said he i must have you dance
i hate to see you       standing about by yourself in this stupid manner
you had much       better dance        i certainly shall not
you know how i detest it unless i am       particularly acquainted with my partner
at such an assembly as       this it would be insupportable
your sisters are engaged and       there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a       punishment to me to stand up with        i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley       for a kingdom
upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant       girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of       them you see uncommonly pretty        you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said       mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet
oh
she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld
but there       is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very       pretty and i dare say very agreeable
do let me ask my partner       to introduce you        which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at       elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly       said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i       am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies       who are slighted by other men
you had better return to your       partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with       me        mr bingley followed his advice
mr darcy walked off and       elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him
she       told the story however with great spirit among her friends for       she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in       anything ridiculous
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the       netherfield party
mr bingley had danced with her twice and she       had been distinguished by his sisters
jane was as much gratified       by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way
elizabeth felt janes pleasure
mary had heard herself mentioned       to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the       neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough       to be never without partners which was all that they had yet       learnt to care for at a ball
they returned therefore in good       spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which       they were the principal inhabitants
they found mr bennet still       up
with a book he was regardless of time and on the present       occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an       evening which had raised such splendid expectations
he had       rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be       disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story       to hear
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a       most delightful evening a most excellent ball
i wish you had       been there
jane was so admired nothing could be like it
everybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her       quite beautiful and danced with her twice
only think of that       my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only       creature in the room that he asked a second time
first of all       he asked miss lucas
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her       but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can       you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going       down the dance
so he enquired who she was and got introduced       and asked her for the two next
then the two third he danced with       miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth       with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the       boulanger        if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband       impatiently he would not have danced half so much
for gods       sake say no more of his partners
oh that he had sprained his       ankle in the first dance        oh
my dear continued mrs bennet i am quite delighted with him
he is so excessively       handsome
and his sisters are charming women
i never in my life       saw anything more elegant than their dresses
i dare say the lace       upon mrs hursts gown        here she was interrupted again
mr bennet protested against any       description of finery
she was therefore obliged to seek another       branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of       spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much       by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid       man not at all worth pleasing
so high and so conceited that       there was no enduring him
he walked here and he walked there       fancying himself so very great
not handsome enough to dance       with
i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one       of your setdowns
i quite detest the man     chapter         when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been       cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her       sister how very much she admired him
he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible       goodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy mannersso       much ease with such perfect good breeding        he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man       ought likewise to be if he possibly can
his character is       thereby complete        i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second       time
i did not expect such a compliment        did not you
i did for you
but that is one great difference       between us
compliments always take you by surprise and me       never
what could be more natural than his asking you again
he       could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as       every other woman in the room
no thanks to his gallantry for       that
well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave       to like him
you have liked many a stupider person        dear lizzy        oh
you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in       general
you never see a fault in anybody
all the world are good       and agreeable in your eyes
i never heard you speak ill of a       human being in my life        i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always       speak what i think        i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder
with       your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and       nonsense of others
affectation of candour is common enoughone       meets with it everywhere
but to be candid without ostentation or       designto take the good of everybodys character and make it       still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone
and so you like this mans sisters too do you
their manners       are not equal to his        certainly not at first
but they are very pleasing women when       you converse with them
miss bingley is to live with her brother       and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a       very charming neighbour in her        elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their       behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in       general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy       of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by       any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve       them
they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good       humour when they were pleased nor in the power of       being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited
they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first       private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand       pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and       of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every       respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of       others
they were of a respectable family in the north of       england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories       than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired       by trade
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred       thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an       estate but did not live to do it
mr bingley intended it       likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was       now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was       doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his       temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at       netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own       but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley       was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs       hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less       disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her
mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by       an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house
he did       look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the       situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner       said in its praise and took it immediately
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in       spite of great opposition of character
bingley was endeared to       darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper       though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own       and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied
on the       strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and       of his judgment the highest opinion
in understanding darcy was       the superior
bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was       clever
he was at the same time haughty reserved and       fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage
bingley was       sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually       giving offence
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was       sufficiently characteristic
bingley had never met with       pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been       most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no       stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as       to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful
darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom       there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had       felt the smallest interest and from none received either       attention or pleasure
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty       but she smiled too much
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they       admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl       and one whom they should not object to know more of
miss bennet       was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt       authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose
chapter         within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the       bennets were particularly intimate
sir william lucas had been       formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable       fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to       the king during his mayoralty
the distinction had perhaps been       felt too strongly
it had given him a disgust to his business       and to his residence in a small market town and quitting       them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile       from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he       could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled       by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the       world
for though elated by his rank it did not render him       supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody
by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation       at st jamess had made him courteous
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a       valuable neighbour to mrs bennet
they had several children
the       eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about       twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk       over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the       assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to       communicate
you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with       civil selfcommand to miss lucas
you were mr bingleys first       choice        yes but he seemed to like his second better        oh
you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice
to be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather       believe he didi heard something about itbut i hardly know       whatsomething about mr robinson        perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson       did not i mention it to you
mr robinsons asking him how he       liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there       were a great many pretty women in the room and which he       thought the prettiest
and his answering immediately to the last       questionoh
the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there       cannot be two opinions on that point        upon my word
well that was very decided indeedthat does seem       as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know        my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza       said charlotte
mr
darcy is not so well worth listening to as       his friend is hepoor elizato be only just tolerable        i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his       illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would       be quite a misfortune to be liked by him
mrs long told me last       night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once       opening his lips        are you quite sure maamis not there a little mistake said       jane
i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her        ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and       he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very       angry at being spoke to        miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much       unless among his intimate acquaintance
with them he is       remarkably agreeable        i do not believe a word of it my dear
if he had been so very       agreeable he would have talked to mrs long
but i can guess how       it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare       say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage       and had come to the ball in a hack chaise        i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas       but i wish he had danced with eliza        another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with       him if i were you        i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with       him        his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as       pride often does because there is an excuse for it
one cannot       wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune       everything in his favour should think highly of himself
if i       may so express it he has a right to be proud        that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily       forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine        pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of       her reflections is a very common failing i believe
by all       that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common       indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that       there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of       selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or       imaginary
vanity and pride are different things though the       words are often used synonymously
a person may be proud without       being vain
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves       vanity to what we would have others think of us        if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came       with his sisters i should not care how proud i was
i would       keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day        then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said       mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away       your bottle directly        the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare       that she would and the argument ended only with the visit
chapter         the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield
the       visit was returned in due form
miss bennets pleasing       manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and       though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger       sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted       with them was expressed towards the two eldest
by jane this       attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth       still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody       hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though       their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in       all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration
it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire       her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to       the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the       first and was in a way to be very much in love but she       considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered       by the world in general since jane united with great strength       of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of       manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to       impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a       disadvantage to be so very guarded
if a woman conceals her       affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose       the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor       consolation to believe the world equally in the dark
there is so       much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it       is not safe to leave any to itself
we can all begin freelya       slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us       who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement
in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection       than she feels
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may       never do more than like her if she does not help him on        but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow
if       i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton       indeed not to discover it too        remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you       do        but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to       conceal it he must find it out        perhaps he must if he sees enough of her
but though bingley       and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours       together and as they always see each other in large mixed       parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in       conversing together
jane should therefore make the most of every       halfhour in which she can command his attention
when she is       secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as       much as she chooses        your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is       in question but the desire of being well married and if i were       determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i       should adopt it
but these are not janes feelings she is not       acting by design
as yet she cannot even be certain of the       degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness
she has known       him only a fortnight
she danced four dances with him at meryton       she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined       in company with him four times
this is not quite enough to make       her understand his character        not as you represent it
had she merely dined with him she       might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but       you must remember that four evenings have been also spent       togetherand four evenings may do a great deal        yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that       they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to       any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has       been unfolded        well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart       and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had       as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his       character for a twelvemonth
happiness in marriage is entirely a       matter of chance
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so       well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does       not advance their felicity in the least
they always continue to       grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of       vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the       defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life        you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound
you know it       is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself        occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister       elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming       an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend
mr darcy       had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at       her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he       looked at her only to criticise
but no sooner had he made it       clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good       feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark       eyes
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure       of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her       figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting       that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was       caught by their easy playfulness
of this she was perfectly       unawareto her he was only the man who made himself agreeable       nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards       conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with       others
his doing so drew her notice
it was at sir william       lucass where a large party were assembled
what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening       to my conversation with colonel forster        that is a question which mr darcy only can answer        but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i       see what he is about
he has a very satirical eye and if i do       not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid       of him        on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming       to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend       to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking       elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said        did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly       well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a       ball at meryton        with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady       energetic        you are severe on us        it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas
i am       going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows        you are a very strange creature by way of a friendalways       wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody
if my       vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable       but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who       must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on       miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it       must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr darcy there       is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar       withkeep your breath to cool your porridgeand i shall keep       mine to swell my song        her performance was pleasing though by no means capital
after a       song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of       several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at       the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of       being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge       and accomplishments was always impatient for display
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given       her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and       conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of       excellence than she had reached
elizabeth easy and unaffected       had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing       half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad       to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the       request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases       and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end       of the room
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of       passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and       was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir       william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began
what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy
there is nothing like dancing after all
i consider it as one of       the first refinements of polished societies        certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue       amongst the less polished societies of the worldevery savage       can dance        sir william only smiled
your friend performs delightfully he       continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i       doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr       darcy        you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir        yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the       sight
do you often dance at st jamess        never sir        do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place        it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid       it        you have a house in town i conclude        mr darcy bowed
i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor i am       fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that       the air of london would agree with lady lucas        he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not       disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving       towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very       gallant thing and called out to her        my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing
mr darcy you must       allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable       partner
you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much       beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given       it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not       unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said       with some discomposure to sir william        indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing
i       entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg       for a partner        mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the       honour of her hand but in vain
elizabeth was determined nor       did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at       persuasion
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to       deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman       dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am       sure to oblige us for one halfhour        mr
darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling
he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss       eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object       to such a partner        elizabeth looked archly and turned away
her resistance had not       injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with       some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley        i can guess the subject of your reverie        i should imagine not        you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many       evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of       your opinion
i was never more annoyed
the insipidity and yet       the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all       these people
what would i give to hear your strictures on them        your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you
my mind was more       agreeably engaged
i have been meditating on the very great       pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman       can bestow        miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired       he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such       reflections
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity        miss elizabeth bennet        miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley
i am all       astonishment
how long has she been such a favouriteand pray       when am i to wish you joy        that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask
a       ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to       love from love to matrimony in a moment
i knew you would be       wishing me joy        nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as       absolutely settled
you will have a charming motherinlaw       indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with       you        he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to       entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced       her that all was safe her wit flowed long
chapter         mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of       two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was       entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and       their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life       could but ill supply the deficiency of his
her father had been       an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds
she had a sister married to a mr phillips who had been a clerk       to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother       settled in london in a respectable line of trade
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most       convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually       tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to       their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way
the two       youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly       frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than       their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to       meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening and however bare of news the       country in general might be they always contrived to learn some       from their aunt
at present indeed they were well supplied both       with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia       regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter       and meryton was the headquarters
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most       interesting intelligence
every day added something to their       knowledge of the officers names and connections
their lodgings       were not long a secret and at length they began to know the       officers themselves
mr philips visited them all and this       opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before
they       could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large       fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was       worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an       ensign
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject       mr bennet coolly observed        from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must       be two of the silliest girls in the country
i have suspected it       some time but i am now convinced        catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with       perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of       captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the       day as he was going the next morning to london
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be       so ready to think your own children silly
if i wished to think       slightingly of anybodys children it should not be of my own       however        if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of       it        yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever        this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not       agree
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every       particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two       youngest daughters uncommonly foolish        my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the       sense of their father and mother
when they get to our age i       dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland       indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel       with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i       shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked       very becoming the other night at sir williams in his       regimentals        mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and       captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did       when they first came she sees them now very often standing in       clarkes library        mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman       with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the       servant waited for an answer
mrs bennets eyes sparkled with       pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter       read        well jane who is it from
what is it about
what does he say
well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love        it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud
my dear friend       if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa       and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest       of our lives for a whole days ttette between two women       can never end without a quarrel
come as soon as you can on the       receipt of this
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with       the officersyours ever        caroline bingley        with the officers cried lydia
i wonder my aunt did not tell       us of that        dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky        can i have the carriage said jane
no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems       likely to rain and then you must stay all night        that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure       that they would not offer to send her home        oh
but the gentlemen will have mr bingleys chaise to go to       meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs        i had much rather go in the coach        but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure
they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they        they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them        but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers       purpose will be answered        she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the       horses were engaged
jane was therefore obliged to go on       horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many       cheerful prognostics of a bad day
her hopes were answered jane       had not been gone long before it rained hard
her sisters were       uneasy for her but her mother was delighted
the rain continued       the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not       come back
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more       than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own
till the next morning however she was not aware of all the       felicity of her contrivance
breakfast was scarcely over when a       servant from netherfield brought the following note for       elizabeth        my dearest lizzy       i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to       be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday
my kind friends       will not hear of my returning home till i am better
they insist also       on my seeing mr jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should       hear of his having been to meand excepting a sore throat and       headache there is not much the matter with meyours c        well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the       note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of       illnessif she should die it would be a comfort to know that it       was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders        oh
i am not at all afraid of her dying
people do not die of little       trifling colds
she will be taken good care of
as long as she       stays there it is all very well
i would go and see her if i       could have the carriage        elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her       though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no       horsewoman walking was her only alternative
she declared her       resolution
how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such       a thing in all this dirt
you will not be fit to be seen when       you get there        i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want        is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the       horses        no indeed
i do not wish to avoid the walk
the distance is       nothing when one has a motive only three miles
i shall be back       by dinner        i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but       every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my       opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is       required        we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and       lydia
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young       ladies set off together
if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we       may see something of captain carter before he goes        in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings       of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk       alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over       stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and       finding herself at last within view of the house with weary       ankles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of       exercise
she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were       assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of       surprise
that she should have walked three miles so early in the       day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible       to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that       they held her in contempt for it
she was received however very       politely by them and in their brothers manners there was       something better than politeness there was good humour and       kindness
mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at       all
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy       which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the       occasions justifying her coming so far alone
the latter was       thinking only of his breakfast
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered
miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and       not well enough to leave her room
elizabeth was glad to be taken       to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the       fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note       how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her       entrance
she was not equal however to much conversation and       when miss bingley left them together could attempt little       beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness       she was treated with
elizabeth silently attended her
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and       elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much       affection and solicitude they showed for jane
the apothecary       came and having examined his patient said as might be       supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must       endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed       and promised her some draughts
the advice was followed readily       for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other       ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact       nothing to do elsewhere
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and       very unwillingly said so
miss bingley offered her the carriage       and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane       testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was       obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to       remain at netherfield for the present
elizabeth most thankfully       consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint       the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes
chapter         at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast       six elizabeth was summoned to dinner
to the civil enquiries       which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of       distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she       could not make a very favourable answer
jane was by no means       better
the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four       times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a       bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves       and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference       towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth       to the enjoyment of all her original dislike
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she       could regard with any complacency
his anxiety for jane was       evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they       prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed       she was considered by the others
she had very little notice from       any but him
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister       scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he       was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at       cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout       had nothing to say to her
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss       bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room
her       manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride       and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty
mrs hurst thought the same and added        she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an       excellent walker
i shall never forget her appearance this       morning
she really looked almost wild        she did indeed louisa
i could hardly keep my countenance
very nonsensical to come at all
why must she be scampering       about the country because her sister had a cold
her hair so       untidy so blowsy        yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches       deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been       let down to hide it not doing its office        your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this       was all lost upon me
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked       remarkably well when she came into the room this morning
her       dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice        you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley       and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your       sister make such an exhibition        certainly not        to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever       it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone
what       could she mean by it
it seems to me to show an abominable sort       of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to       decorum        it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing       said bingley
i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half       whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration       of her fine eyes        not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise       a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again
i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a       very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well       settled
but with such a father and mother and such low       connections i am afraid there is no chance of it        i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in       meryton        yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside        that is capital added her sister and they both laughed       heartily
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried       bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable        but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men       of any consideration in the world replied darcy
to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it       their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at       the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room       on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to       coffee
she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit       her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of       seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than       pleasant that she should go downstairs herself
on entering the       drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was       immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be       playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse       said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay       below with a book
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment
do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather       singular        miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards
she is a       great reader and has no pleasure in anything else        i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried       elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in       many things        in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said       bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her       quite well        elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a       table where a few books were lying
he immediately offered to       fetch her others all that his library afforded
and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own       credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i       have more than i ever looked into        elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with       those in the room
i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have       left so small a collection of books
what a delightful library       you have at pemberley mr darcy        it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many       generations        and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always       buying books        i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days       as these        neglect
i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the       beauties of that noble place
charles when you build your       house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley        i wish it may        but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that       neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model
there is       not a finer county in england than derbyshire        with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will       sell it        i am talking of possibilities charles        upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get       pemberley by purchase than by imitation        elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her       very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly       aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself       between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game
is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley       will she be as tall as i am        i think she will
she is now about miss elizabeth bennets       height or rather taller        how i long to see her again
i never met with anybody who       delighted me so much
such a countenance such mannersand so       extremely accomplished for her age
her performance on the       pianoforte is exquisite        it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have       patience to be so very accomplished as they all are        all young ladies accomplished
my dear charles what do you       mean        yes all of them i think
they all paint tables cover screens       and net purses
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this       and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first       time without being informed that she was very accomplished        your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy       has too much truth
the word is applied to many a woman who       deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a       screen
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your       estimation of ladies in general
i cannot boast of knowing more       than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that       are really accomplished        nor i i am sure said miss bingley
then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in       your idea of an accomplished woman        yes i do comprehend a great deal in it        oh
certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be       really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is       usually met with
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of       music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to       deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a       certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of       her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but       half deserved        all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she       must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of       her mind by extensive reading        i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished       women
i rather wonder now at your knowing any        are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility       of all this        i never saw such a woman
i never saw such capacity and       taste and application and elegance as you describe united        mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice       of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew       many women who answered this description when mr hurst called       them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to       what was going forward
as all conversation was thereby at an       end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed       on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend       themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with       many men i dare say it succeeds
but in my opinion it is a       paltry device a very mean art        undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly       addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies       sometimes condescend to employ for captivation
whatever bears       affinity to cunning is despicable        miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to       continue the subject
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was       worse and that she could not leave her
bingley urged mr joness       being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no       country advice could be of any service recommended an express to       town for one of the most eminent physicians
this she would not       hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their       brothers proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be       sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly       better
bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared       that they were miserable
they solaced their wretchedness       however by duets after supper while he could find no better       relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions       that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her       sister
chapter         elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and       in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable       answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr       bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two       elegant ladies who waited on his sisters
in spite of this       amendment however she requested to have a note sent to       longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own       judgment of her situation
the note was immediately dispatched       and its contents as quickly complied with
mrs bennet       accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon       after the family breakfast
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have       been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her       illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering       immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove       her from netherfield
she would not listen therefore to her       daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the       apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all       advisable
after sitting a little while with jane on miss       bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three       daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour
bingley       met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet       worse than she expected
indeed i have sir was her answer
she is a great deal too       ill to be moved
mr jones says we must not think of moving her
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness        removed cried bingley
it must not be thought of
my sister       i am sure will not hear of her removal        you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold       civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention       while she remains with us        mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do       not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed       and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the       world which is always the way with her for she has without       exception the sweetest temper i ever met with
i often tell       my other girls they are nothing to her
you have a sweet room       here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to       netherfield
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i       hope though you have but a short lease        whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if       i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in       five minutes
at present however i consider myself as quite       fixed here        that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said       elizabeth
you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards       her
oh
yesi understand you perfectly        i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily       seen through i am afraid is pitiful        that is as it happens
it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate       character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours        lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not       run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home        i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you       were a studier of character
it must be an amusing study        yes but intricate characters are the most amusing
they have       at least that advantage        the country said darcy can in general supply but few       subjects for such a study
in a country neighbourhood you move in       a very confined and unvarying society        but people themselves alter so much that there is something new       to be observed in them for ever        yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of       mentioning a country neighbourhood
i assure you there is quite       as much of that going on in the country as in town        everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a       moment turned silently away
mrs bennet who fancied she had       gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph
i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the       country for my part except the shops and public places
the       country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley        when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave       it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same
they have       each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either        ayethat is because you have the right disposition
but that       gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was       nothing at all        indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for       her mother
you quite mistook mr darcy
he only meant that       there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the       country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true        certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not       meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there       are few neighbourhoods larger
i know we dine with       fourandtwenty families        nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep       his countenance
his sister was less delicate and directed her       eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile
elizabeth       for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers       thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn       since her coming away
yes she called yesterday with her father
what an agreeable man       sir william is mr bingleyis not he
so much the man of       fashion
so genteel and so easy
he has always something to say to       everybody
that is my idea of good breeding and those persons       who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths       quite mistake the matter        did charlotte dine with you        no she would go home
i fancy she was wanted about the       mincepies
for my part mr bingley i always keep servants       that can do their own work my daughters are brought up       differently
but everybody is to judge for themselves and the       lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you
it is a pity       they are not handsome
not that i think charlotte so very       plainbut then she is our particular friend        she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley
oh
dear yes but you must own she is very plain
lady lucas       herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty
i do not       like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not       often see anybody better looking
it is what everybody says
i do       not trust my own partiality
when she was only fifteen there was       a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her       that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before       we came away
but however he did not
perhaps he thought her       too young
however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty       they were        and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently
there       has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way
i wonder       who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away       love        i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said       darcy
of a fine stout healthy love it may
everything nourishes what       is strong already
but if it be only a slight thin sort of       inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it       entirely away        darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made       elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself       again
she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say       and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks       to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for       troubling him also with lizzy
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil       in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also       and say what the occasion required
she performed her part indeed       without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and       soon afterwards ordered her carriage
upon this signal the       youngest of her daughters put herself forward
the two girls had       been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the       result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with       having promised on his first coming into the country to give a       ball at netherfield
lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine       complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her       mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early       age
she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural       selfconsequence which the attentions of the officers to whom       her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended       her had increased into assurance
she was very equal therefore       to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly       reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most       shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it
his answer to       this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and       when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the       very day of the ball
but you would not wish to be dancing while       she is ill        lydia declared herself satisfied
oh
yesit would be much       better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely       captain carter would be at meryton again
and when you have given       your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one       also
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he       does not        mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth       returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations       behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the       latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in       their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms       on fine eyes
chapter         the day passed much as the day before had done
mrs hurst and       miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the       invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the       evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom
the       loo table however did not appear
mr darcy was writing and       miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his       letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to       his sister
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs       hurst was observing their game
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in       attending to what passed between darcy and his companion
the       perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting       or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter       with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received       formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her       opinion of each
how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter        he made no answer
you write uncommonly fast        you are mistaken
i write rather slowly        how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course       of a year
letters of business too
how odious i should think       them        it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to       yours        pray tell your sister that i long to see her        i have already told her so once by your desire        i am afraid you do not like your pen
let me mend it for you
i       mend pens remarkably well        thank youbut i always mend my own        how can you contrive to write so even        he was silent
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on       the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with       her beautiful little design for a table and i think it       infinitely superior to miss grantleys        will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write       again
at present i have not room to do them justice        oh
it is of no consequence
i shall see her in january
but do       you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy        they are generally long but whether always charming it is not       for me to determine        it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter       with ease cannot write ill        that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her       brother because he does not write with ease
he studies too       much for words of four syllables
do not you darcy        my style of writing is very different from yours        oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless       way imaginable
he leaves out half his words and blots the       rest        my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby       which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my       correspondents        your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm       reproof        nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of       humility
it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes       an indirect boast        and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of       modesty        the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in       writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity       of thought and carelessness of execution which if not       estimable you think at least highly interesting
the power of       doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the       possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of       the performance
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if       you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in       five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of       compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in       a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone       and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else        nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all       the foolish things that were said in the morning
and yet upon       my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i       believe it at this moment
at least therefore i did not assume       the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before       the ladies        i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that       you would be gone with such celerity
your conduct would be quite       as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you       were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had       better stay till next week you would probably do it you would       probably not goand at another word might stay a month        you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr       bingley did not do justice to his own disposition
you have shown       him off now much more than he did himself        i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting       what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my       temper
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that       gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think       the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat       denial and ride off as fast as i could        would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original       intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it        upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must       speak for himself        you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call       mine but which i have never acknowledged
allowing the case       however to stand according to your representation you must       remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire       his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely       desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of       its propriety        to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no       merit with you        to yield without conviction is no compliment to the       understanding of either        you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence       of friendship and affection
a regard for the requester would       often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for       arguments to reason one into it
i am not particularly speaking       of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley
we may as       well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we       discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon
but in general       and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them       is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great       moment should you think ill of that person for complying with       the desire without waiting to be argued into it        will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to       arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which       is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of       intimacy subsisting between the parties        by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars       not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will       have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be       aware of
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall       fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so       much deference
i declare i do not know a more awful object than       darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his       own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has       nothing to do        mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that       he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh
miss       bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an       expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense
i see your design bingley said his friend
you dislike an       argument and want to silence this        perhaps i do
arguments are too much like disputes
if you and       miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall       be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me        what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and       mr darcy had much better finish his letter        mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and       elizabeth for the indulgence of some music
miss bingley moved       with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request       that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and       more earnestly negatived she seated herself
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus       employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over       some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr       darcys eyes were fixed on her
she hardly knew how to suppose       that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and       yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still       more strange
she could only imagine however at last that she       drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and       reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other       person present
the supposition did not pain her
she liked him       too little to care for his approbation
after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm       by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing       near elizabeth said to her        do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such       an opportunity of dancing a reel        she smiled but made no answer
he repeated the question with       some surprise at her silence
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately       determine what to say in reply
you wanted me i know to say       yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste       but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and       cheating a person of their premeditated contempt
i have       therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to       dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare        indeed i do not dare        elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at       his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness       in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody       and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by       her
he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of       her connections he should be in some danger
miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her       great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received       some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by       talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in       such an alliance
i hope said she as they were walking together in the       shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few       hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage       of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the       younger girls of running after the officers
and if i may mention so       delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something       bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady       possesses        have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity        oh
yes
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be       placed in the gallery at pemberley
put them next to your       great uncle the judge
they are in the same profession you know       only in different lines
as for your elizabeths picture you       must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to       those beautiful eyes        it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but       their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine       might be copied        at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and       elizabeth herself
i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in       some confusion lest they had been overheard
you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away       without telling us that you were coming out        then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth       to walk by herself
the path just admitted three
mr darcy felt       their rudeness and immediately said        this walk is not wide enough for our party
we had better go       into the avenue        but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with       them laughingly answered        no no stay where you are
you are charmingly grouped and       appear to uncommon advantage
the picturesque would be spoilt by       admitting a fourth
goodbye        she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the       hope of being at home again in a day or two
jane was already so       much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of       hours that evening
chapter         when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her       sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into       the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with       many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them       so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the       gentlemen appeared
their powers of conversation were       considerable
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy       relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance       with spirit
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first       object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy       and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many       steps
he addressed himself to miss bennet with a polite       congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he       was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for       bingleys salutation
he was full of joy and attention
the first       halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer       from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the       other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the       door
he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone       else
elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with       great delight
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the       cardtablebut in vain
she had obtained private intelligence       that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found       even his open petition rejected
she assured him that no one       intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the       subject seemed to justify her
mr hurst had therefore nothing to       do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep
darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst       principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings       joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss       bennet
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching       mr darcys progress through his book as in reading her own       and she was perpetually either making some enquiry or looking at       his page
she could not win him however to any conversation he       merely answered her question and read on
at length quite       exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which       she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she       gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an       evening in this way
i declare after all there is no enjoyment       like reading
how much sooner one tires of anything than of a       book
when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i       have not an excellent library        no one made any reply
she then yawned again threw aside her       book and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some       amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss       bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said        by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a       dance at netherfield
i would advise you before you determine on       it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much       mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be       rather a punishment than a pleasure        if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he       chooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a       settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup       enough i shall send round my cards        i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they       were carried on in a different manner but there is something       insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting
it       would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of       dancing were made the order of the day        much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would       not be near so much like a ball        miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and       walked about the room
her figure was elegant and she walked       well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly       studious
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one       effort more and turning to elizabeth said        miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and       take a turn about the room
i assure you it is very refreshing       after sitting so long in one attitude        elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately
miss       bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr       darcy looked up
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention       in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously       closed his book
he was directly invited to join their party but       he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives       for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with       either of which motives his joining them would interfere
what       could he mean
she was dying to know what could be his       meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand       him
not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be       severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to       ask nothing about it        miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy       in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation       of his two motives
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he       as soon as she allowed him to speak
you either choose this       method of passing the evening because you are in each others       confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you       are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage       in walking if the first i would be completely in your way and       if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the       fire        oh
shocking cried miss bingley
i never heard anything so       abominable
how shall we punish him for such a speech        nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said       elizabeth
we can all plague and punish one another
tease       himlaugh at him
intimate as you are you must know how it is to       be done        but upon my honour i do not
i do assure you that my intimacy       has not yet taught me that
tease calmness of manner and       presence of mind
no no i feel he may defy us there
and as to       laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by       attempting to laugh without a subject
mr darcy may hug       himself        mr
darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth
that is an       uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it       would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances
i       dearly love a laugh        miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be
the wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of their       actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object       in life is a joke        certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope       i am not one of them
i hope i never ridicule what is wise and       good
follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do       divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can
but these       i suppose are precisely what you are without        perhaps that is not possible for anyone
but it has been the       study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a       strong understanding to ridicule        such as vanity and pride        yes vanity is a weakness indeed
but pridewhere there is a       real superiority of mind pride will be always under good       regulation        elizabeth turned away to hide a smile
your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss       bingley and pray what is the result        i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect
he       owns it himself without disguise        no said darcy i have made no such pretension
i have faults       enough but they are not i hope of understanding
my temper i       dare not vouch for
it is i believe too little       yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world
i       cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought       nor their offenses against myself
my feelings are not puffed       about with every attempt to move them
my temper would perhaps be       called resentful
my good opinion once lost is lost forever        that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth
implacable       resentment is a shade in a character
but you have chosen your       fault well
i really cannot laugh at it
you are safe from me        there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some       particular evila natural defect which not even the best       education can overcome        and your defect is to hate everybody        and yours he replied with a smile is willfully to       misunderstand them        do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a       conversation in which she had no share
louisa you will not       mind my waking mr hurst        her sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was       opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not       sorry for it
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too       much attention
chapter         in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth       wrote the next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage       might be sent for them in the course of the day
but mrs bennet       who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till       the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week       could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before
her       answer therefore was not propitious at least not to       elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home
mrs       bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the       carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that       if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she       could spare them very well
against staying longer however       elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it       would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered       as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow       mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled       that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning       should be mentioned and the request made
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough       was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day       to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for       her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her       affection for the other
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to       go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it       would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but       jane was firm where she felt herself to be right
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at       netherfield long enough
she attracted him more than he likedand       miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to       himself
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no       sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could       elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible       that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the       last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it
steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through       the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by       themselves for halfanhour he adhered most conscientiously to       his book and would not even look at her
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to       almost all took place
miss bingleys civility to elizabeth       increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for       jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the       pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn       or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook       hands with the former
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in       the liveliest of spirits
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother
mrs       bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to       give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold       again
but their father though very laconic in his expressions       of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their       importance in the family circle
the evening conversation when       they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and       almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thoroughbass and       human nature and had some extracts to admire and some new       observations of threadbare morality to listen to
catherine and       lydia had information for them of a different sort
much had been       done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding       wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their       uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been       hinted that colonel forster was going to be married
chapter         i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at       breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner       today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family       party        who do you mean my dear
i know of nobody that is coming i am       sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope       my dinners are good enough for her
i do not believe she often       sees such at home        the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger        mrs bennets eyes sparkled
a gentleman and a stranger
it is       mr bingley i am sure
well i am sure i shall be extremely glad       to see mr bingley
butgood lord
how unlucky
there is not a       bit of fish to be got today
lydia my love ring the belli       must speak to hill this moment        it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom       i never saw in the whole course of my life        this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of       being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at       once
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus       explained        about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight       ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and       requiring early attention
it is from my cousin mr collins       who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon       as he pleases        oh
my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that       mentioned
pray do not talk of that odious man
i do think it is       the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be       entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had       been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other       about it        jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an       entail
they had often attempted to do it before but it was a       subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and       she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an       estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man       whom nobody cared anything about
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and       nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting       longbourn
but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps       be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself        no that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very       impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical
i hate such false friends
why could he not keep on quarreling       with you as his father did before him        why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on       that head as you will hear        hunsford near westerham kent th october
dear sir       the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late       honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have       had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal       the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts       fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to       be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him       to be at variancethere mrs bennetmy mind however is now       made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter       i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage       of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir       lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to       the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest       endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her       ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies       which are instituted by the church of england
as a clergyman       moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing       of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on       these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are       highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in       the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your       side and not lead you to reject the offered olivebranch
i       cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring       your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as       well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible       amendsbut of this hereafter
if you should have no objection to       receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of       waiting on you and your family monday november th by four       oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the       saturday seennight following which i can do without any       inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my       occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other       clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the dayi remain dear       sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your       wellwisher and friend        william collins        at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking       gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter
he       seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my       word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance       especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him       come to us again        there is some sense in what he says about the girls however       and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the       person to discourage him        though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can       mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is       certainly to his credit        elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for       lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying       and burying his parishioners whenever it were required
he must be an oddity i think said she
i cannot make him       outthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can       he mean by apologising for being next in the entailwe cannot       suppose he would help it if he couldcould he be a sensible man       sir        no my dear i think not
i have great hopes of finding him       quite the reverse
there is a mixture of servility and       selfimportance in his letter which promises well
i am       impatient to see him        in point of composition said mary the letter does not seem       defective
the idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly       new yet i think it is well expressed        to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in       any degree interesting
it was next to impossible that their       cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks       since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any       other colour
as for their mother mr collinss letter had done       away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with       a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great       politeness by the whole family
mr bennet indeed said little       but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed       neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent       himself
he was a tall heavylooking young man of       fiveandtwenty
his air was grave and stately and his manners       were very formal
he had not been long seated before he       complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters       said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance       fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not       doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers       but mrs bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most       readily
you are very kind i am sure and i wish with all my heart it       may prove so for else they will be destitute enough
things are       settled so oddly        you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate        ah
sir i do indeed
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls       you must confess
not that i mean to find fault with you for       such things i know are all chance in this world
there is no       knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed        i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins       and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of       appearing forward and precipitate
but i can assure the young       ladies that i come prepared to admire them
at present i will not       say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted        he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled       on each other
they were not the only objects of mr collinss       admiration
the hall the diningroom and all its furniture       were examined and praised and his commendation of everything       would have touched mrs bennets heart but for the mortifying       supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property
the       dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know       to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was       owing
but he was set right there by mrs bennet who assured him       with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good       cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen
he       begged pardon for having displeased her
in a softened tone she       declared herself not at all offended but he continued to       apologise for about a quarter of an hour
chapter         during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the       servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some       conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in       which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very       fortunate in his patroness
lady catherine de bourghs attention       to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very       remarkable
mr bennet could not have chosen better
mr collins       was eloquent in her praise
the subject elevated him to more than       usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he       protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour       in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had       himself experienced from lady catherine
she had been graciously       pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already       had the honour of preaching before her
she had also asked him       twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday       before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening
lady       catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had       never seen anything but affability in her
she had always spoken       to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the       smallest objection to his joining in the society of the       neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a       week or two to visit his relations
she had even condescended to       advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with       discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble       parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations       he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some       herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs        that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet       and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman
it is a pity that       great ladies in general are not more like her
does she live near       you sir        the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by       a lane from rosings park her ladyships residence        i think you said she was a widow sir
has she any family        she has only one daughter the heiress of rosings and of very       extensive property        ah said mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off       than many girls
and what sort of young lady is she
is she       handsome        she is a most charming young lady indeed
lady catherine herself       says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far       superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in       her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has       prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments       which she could not have otherwise failed of as i am informed by       the lady who superintended her education and who still resides       with them
but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to       drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies        has she been presented
i do not remember her name among the       ladies at court        her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in       town and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has       deprived the british court of its brightest ornament
her       ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i       am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate       compliments which are always acceptable to ladies
i have more       than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter       seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank       instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her
these       are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it       is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound       to pay        you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for       you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy
may       i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse       of the moment or are the result of previous study        they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though       i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such       little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary       occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as       possible        mr bennets expectations were fully answered
his cousin was as       absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest       enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute       composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at       elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure
by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr bennet       was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when       tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies
mr       collins readily assented and a book was produced but on       beholding it for everything announced it to be from a       circulating library he started back and begging pardon       protested that he never read novels
kitty stared at him and       lydia exclaimed
other books were produced and after some       deliberation he chose fordyces sermons
lydia gaped as he opened       the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity       read three pages she interrupted him with        do you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning away       richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him
my aunt       told me so herself on saturday
i shall walk to meryton tomorrow       to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from       town        lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but       mr collins much offended laid aside his book and said        i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by       books of a serious stamp though written solely for their       benefit
it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be       nothing so advantageous to them as instruction
but i will no       longer importune my young cousin        then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist       at backgammon
mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that       he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling       amusements
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly       for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur       again if he would resume his book but mr collins after       assuring them that he bore his young cousin no illwill and       should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself       at another table with mr bennet and prepared for backgammon
chapter         mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature       had been but little assisted by education or society the       greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of       an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one       of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms       without forming at it any useful acquaintance
the subjection in       which his father had brought him up had given him originally       great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted       by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the       consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity
a       fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh       when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he       felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his       patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his       authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him       altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance       and humility
having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended       to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn       family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the       daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were       represented by common report
this was his plan of amendsof       atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it       an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and       excessively generous and disinterested on his own part
his plan did not vary on seeing them
miss bennets lovely face       confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of       what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was       his settled choice
the next morning however made an       alteration for in a quarter of an hours ttette with mrs       bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his       parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his       hopes that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn       produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general       encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on
as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to       sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any       prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mentionshe       felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon       engaged        mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was       soon donedone while mrs bennet was stirring the fire
elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded       her of course
mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might       soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not       bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every       sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to       attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious       to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither       mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would       continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the       collection but really talking to mr bennet with little       cessation of his house and garden at hunsford
such doings       discomposed mr bennet exceedingly
in his library he had been       always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as       he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other       room of the house he was used to be free from them there his       civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to       join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact       much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely       pleased to close his large book and go
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his       cousins their time passed till they entered meryton
the       attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by       him
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in       quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet       indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall       them
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man       whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike       appearance walking with another officer on the other side of the       way
the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return       from london lydia came to enquire and he bowed as they passed
all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he       could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find       out led the way across the street under pretense of wanting       something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained       the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached       the same spot
mr denny addressed them directly and entreated       permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned       with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had       accepted a commission in their corps
this was exactly as it       should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him       completely charming
his appearance was greatly in his favour he       had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good       figure and very pleasing address
the introduction was followed       up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness       at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole       party were still standing and talking together very agreeably       when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley       were seen riding down the street
on distinguishing the ladies of       the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and       began the usual civilities
bingley was the principal spokesman       and miss bennet the principal object
he was then he said on       his way to longbourn on purpose to enquire after her
mr darcy       corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to       fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by       the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the       countenance of both as they looked at each other was all       astonishment at the effect of the meeting
both changed colour       one looked white the other red
mr wickham after a few       moments touched his hata salutation which mr darcy just       deigned to return
what could be the meaning of it
it was       impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know
in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have       noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the       door of mr phillips house and then made their bows in spite       of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in and       even in spite of mrs phillipss throwing up the parlour window       and loudly seconding the invitation
mrs phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two       eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and       she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return       home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she       should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see       mr joness shopboy in the street who had told her that they       were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the       miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed       towards mr collins by janes introduction of him
she received       him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much       more apologising for his intrusion without any previous       acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering       himself however might be justified by his relationship to the       young ladies who introduced him to her notice
mrs phillips was       quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her       contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by       exclamations and enquiries about the other of whom however she       could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny       had brought him from london and that he was to have a       lieutenants commission in the shire
she had been watching him       the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and       had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have       continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now       except a few of the officers who in comparison with the       stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows some of       them were to dine with the phillipses the next day and their       aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give       him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come       in the evening
this was agreed to and mrs phillips protested       that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery       tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards
the prospect       of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual       good spirits
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the       room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were       perfectly needless
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen       pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have       defended either or both had they appeared to be in the wrong       she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by       admiring mrs phillipss manners and politeness
he protested       that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a       more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the       utmost civility but even pointedly included him in her       invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her       before
something he supposed might be attributed to his       connection with them but yet he had never met with so much       attention in the whole course of his life
chapter         as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with       their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and       mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most       steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at       a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of       hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr wickham had       accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house
when this information was given and they had all taken their       seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire       and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the       apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself       in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison       that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs       phillips understood from him what rosings was and who was its       proprietorwhen she had listened to the description of only one       of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the       chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all       the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a       comparison with the housekeepers room
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her       mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble       abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily       employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs       phillips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his       consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving       to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could
to       the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had       nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their       own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the       interval of waiting appeared very long
it was over at last       however
the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked       into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing       him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree       of unreasonable admiration
the officers of the shire were in       general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of       them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond       them all in person countenance air and walk as they were       superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillips breathing       port wine who followed them into the room
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female       eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he       finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he       immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its       being a wet night made her feel that the commonest dullest       most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill       of the speaker
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and       the officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to       the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at       intervals a kind listener in mrs phillips and was by her       watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin
when the cardtables were placed he had the opportunity of       obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be       glad to improve myself for in my situation in life mrs       phillips was very glad for his compliance but could not wait for       his reason
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he       received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia
at first       there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she       was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond       of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the       game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to       have attention for anyone in particular
allowing for the common       demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk       to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what       she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldthe       history of his acquaintance with mr darcy
she dared not even       mention that gentleman
her curiosity however was unexpectedly       relieved
mr wickham began the subject himself
he enquired how       far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her       answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been       staying there
about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the       subject drop added he is a man of very large property in       derbyshire i understand        yes replied mr wickham his estate there is a noble one
a       clear ten thousand per annum
you could not have met with a       person more capable of giving you certain information on that       head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a       particular manner from my infancy        elizabeth could not but look surprised
you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion       after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our       meeting yesterday
are you much acquainted with mr darcy        as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth very warmly
i       have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him       very disagreeable        i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his       being agreeable or otherwise
i am not qualified to form one
i       have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge
it is       impossible for me to be impartial
but i believe your opinion       of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not       express it quite so strongly anywhere else
here you are in your       own family        upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house       in the neighbourhood except netherfield
he is not at all liked       in hertfordshire
everybody is disgusted with his pride
you will       not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone        i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short       interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated       beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often       happen
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or       frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as       he chooses to be seen        i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an       illtempered man wickham only shook his head
i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking       whether he is likely to be in this country much longer        i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away       when i was at netherfield
i hope your plans in favour of the       shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood        oh
noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy
if       he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go
we are not on       friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i       have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim       before all the world a sense of very great illusage and most       painful regrets at his being what he is
his father miss bennet       the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed       and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company       with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a       thousand tender recollections
his behaviour to myself has been       scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and       everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and       disgracing the memory of his father        elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and       listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented       further enquiry
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the       neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all       that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but       very intelligible gallantry
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he       added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire
i       knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend       denny tempted me further by his account of their present       quarters and the very great attentions and excellent       acquaintances meryton had procured them
society i own is       necessary to me
i have been a disappointed man and my spirits       will not bear solitude
i must have employment and society
a       military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances       have now made it eligible
the church ought to have been my       professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this       time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it       pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now        indeed        yesthe late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of       the best living in his gift
he was my godfather and excessively       attached to me
i cannot do justice to his kindness
he meant to       provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the       living fell it was given elsewhere        good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be
how       could his will be disregarded
why did you not seek legal       redress        there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest       as to give me no hope from law
a man of honour could not have       doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to       treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert       that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance       imprudencein short anything or nothing
certain it is that the       living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to       hold it and that it was given to another man and no less       certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done       anything to deserve to lose it
i have a warm unguarded temper       and i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too       freely
i can recall nothing worse
but the fact is that we are       very different sort of men and that he hates me        this is quite shocking
he deserves to be publicly disgraced        some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me
till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him        elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him       handsomer than ever as he expressed them
but what said she after a pause can have been his motive
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly        a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot       but attribute in some measure to jealousy
had the late mr darcy       liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his       fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very       early in life
he had not a temper to bear the sort of       competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was       often given me        i had not thought mr darcy so bad as thisthough i have never       liked him
i had not thought so very ill of him
i had supposed       him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not       suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such       injustice such inhumanity as this        after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do       remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the       implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving       temper
his disposition must be dreadful        i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i       can hardly be just to him        elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed       to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite       of his father she could have added a young man too like       you whose very countenance may vouch for your being       amiablebut she contented herself with and one too who had       probably been his companion from childhood connected together       as i think you said in the closest manner        we were born in the same parish within the same park the       greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the       same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same       parental care
my father began life in the profession which       your uncle mr phillips appears to do so much credit tobut he       gave up everything to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted       all his time to the care of the pemberley property
he was most       highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential       friend
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the       greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence and       when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a       voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he       felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his       affection to myself        how strange cried elizabeth
how abominable
i wonder that       the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you
if       from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to       be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call it        it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions       may be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend
it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other       feeling
but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour       to me there were stronger impulses even than pride        can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good        yes
it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give       his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants       and relieve the poor
family pride and filial pridefor he is       very proud of what his father washave done this
not to appear       to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities       or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful       motive
he has also brotherly pride which with some       brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian       of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the       most attentive and best of brothers        what sort of girl is miss darcy        he shook his head
i wish i could call her amiable
it gives me       pain to speak ill of a darcy
but she is too much like her       brothervery very proud
as a child she was affectionate and       pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and       hours to her amusement
but she is nothing to me now
she is a       handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand       highly accomplished
since her fathers death her home has been       london where a lady lives with her and superintends her       education        after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth       could not help reverting once more to the first and saying        i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley
how can mr       bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe       truly amiable be in friendship with such a man
how can they       suit each other
do you know mr bingley        not at all        he is a sweettempered amiable charming man
he cannot know       what mr darcy is        probably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses
he does       not want abilities
he can be a conversible companion if he       thinks it worth his while
among those who are at all his equals       in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the       less prosperous
his pride never deserts him but with the rich       he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and       perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure        the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered       round the other table and mr collins took his station between       his cousin elizabeth and mrs phillips
the usual enquiries as to       his success were made by the latter
it had not been very great       he had lost every point but when mrs phillips began to express       her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity       that it was not of the least importance that he considered the       money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make       herself uneasy
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down       to a cardtable they must take their chances of these things       and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five       shillings any object
there are undoubtedly many who could not       say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am       removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters        mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr       collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice       whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the       family of de bourgh
lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given       him a living
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced       to her notice but he certainly has not known her long        you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne       darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present       mr darcy        no indeed i did not
i knew nothing at all of lady catherines       connections
i never heard of her existence till the day before       yesterday        her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune       and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two       estates        this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor       miss bingley
vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and       useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself       if he were already selfdestined for another
mr
collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine       and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related       of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that       in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant       conceited woman        i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i       have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i       never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and       insolent
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and       clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities       from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner       and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chooses that       everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the       first class        elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of       it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction       till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies       their share of mr wickhams attentions
there could be no       conversation in the noise of mrs phillipss supper party but       his manners recommended him to everybody
whatever he said was       said well and whatever he did done gracefully
elizabeth went       away with her head full of him
she could think of nothing but of       mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but       there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went       for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent
lydia talked       incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the       fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of       mr and mrs phillips protesting that he did not in the least       regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper       and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to       say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at       longbourn house
chapter         elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between       mr wickham and herself
jane listened with astonishment and       concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so       unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her       nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable       appearance as wickham
the possibility of his having endured such       unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and       nothing remained therefore to be done but to think well of them       both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account       of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some       way or other of which we can form no idea
interested people       have perhaps misrepresented each to the other
it is in short       impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which       may have alienated them without actual blame on either side        very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to       say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been       concerned in the business
do clear them too or we shall be       obliged to think ill of somebody        laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my       opinion
my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful       light it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite       in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide       for
it is impossible
no man of common humanity no man who had       any value for his character could be capable of it
can his most       intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him
oh
no        i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on       than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as       he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without       ceremony
if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it
besides       there was truth in his looks        it is difficult indeedit is distressing
one does not know what       to think        i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think        but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr       bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer       when the affair became public
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this       conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom       they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give       their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at       netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday
the two       ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it       an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been       doing with herself since their separation
to the rest of the       family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much       as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to       the others
they were soon gone again rising from their seats       with an activity which took their brother by surprise and       hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to       every female of the family
mrs bennet chose to consider it as       given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly       flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself       instead of a ceremonious card
jane pictured to herself a happy       evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of       their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a       great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of       everything in mr darcys look and behaviour
the happiness       anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single       event or any particular person for though they each like       elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he       was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a       ball was at any rate a ball
and even mary could assure her       family that she had no disinclination for it
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is       enoughi think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening       engagements
society has claims on us all and i profess myself       one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement       as desirable for everybody        elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though       she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could       not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys       invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to       join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to       find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and       was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop       or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance
i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a       ball of this kind given by a young man of character to       respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far       from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be       honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of       the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours       miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference       which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause       and not to any disrespect for her        elizabeth felt herself completely taken in
she had fully       proposed being engaged by mr wickham for those very dances and       to have mr collins instead
her liveliness had never been worse       timed
there was no help for it however
mr wickhams happiness       and her own were perforce delayed a little longer and mr       collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea       it suggested of something more
it now first struck her that       she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being       mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a       quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible       visitors
the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed       his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent       attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more       astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms       it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the       probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her
elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well       aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any       reply
mr collins might never make the offer and till he did       it was useless to quarrel about him
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk       of the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable       state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the       day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented       their walking to meryton once
no aunt no officers no news       could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were       got by proxy
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her       patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of       her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance       on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and       monday endurable to kitty and lydia
chapter         till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and       looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats       there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred       to her
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any       of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed       her
she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in       the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained       unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might       be won in the course of the evening
but in an instant arose the       dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys       pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though       this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence       was pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly       applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to       town on business the day before and was not yet returned       adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business       would have called him away just now if he had not wanted to       avoid a certain gentleman here        this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was       caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not       less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise       had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former       was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could       hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries       which he directly afterwards approached to make
attendance       forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham
she was       resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned       away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly       surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality       provoked her
but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every       prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not       dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to       charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon       able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her       cousin and to point him out to her particular notice
the first       two dances however brought a return of distress they were       dances of mortification
mr collins awkward and solemn       apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without       being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a       disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give
the moment       of her release from him was ecstasy
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of       talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and       was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly       addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his       application for her hand that without knowing what she did she       accepted him
he walked away again immediately and she was left       to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to       console her        i dare say you will find him very agreeable        heaven forbid
that would be the greatest misfortune of all
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate
do not       wish me such an evil        when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to       claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a       whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham       to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his       consequence
elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the       set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being       allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her       neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it
they       stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to       imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances       and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying       that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige       him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance
he       replied and was again silent
after a pause of some minutes she       addressed him a second time withit is your turn to say       something now mr darcy
i talked about the dance and you       ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room or the       number of couples        he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say       should be said
very well
that reply will do for the present
perhaps by and by       i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public       ones
but now we may be silent        do you talk by rule then while you are dancing        sometimes
one must speak a little you know
it would look odd       to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the       advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as       that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible        are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do       you imagine that you are gratifying mine        both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great       similarity in the turn of our minds
we are each of an unsocial       taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say       something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to       posterity with all the clat of a proverb        this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am       sure said he
how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend       to say
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly        i must not decide on my own performance        he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone       down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not       very often walk to meryton
she answered in the affirmative and       unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there       the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance        the effect was immediate
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread       his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though       blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on
at length       darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr
wickham is       blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making       friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them is       less certain        he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied       elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to       suffer from all his life        darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the       subject
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to       them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the       room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of       superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his       partner
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir
such very       superior dancing is not often seen
it is evident that you belong       to the first circles
allow me to say however that your fair       partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this       pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable       event my dear eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall       take place
what congratulations will then flow in
i appeal to       mr darcybut let me not interrupt you sir
you will not thank       me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young       lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me        the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but       sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him       forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious       expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together
recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner       and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we       were talking of        i do not think we were speaking at all
sir william could not       have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for       themselves
we have tried two or three subjects already without       success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine        what think you of books said he smiling

no
i am sure we never read the same or not with the       same feelings        i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at       least be no want of subject
we may compare our different       opinions        noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full       of something else        the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it said       he with a look of doubt
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for       her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon       afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember       hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave       that your resentment once created was unappeasable
you are very       cautious i suppose as to its being created        i am said he with a firm voice
and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice        i hope not        it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their       opinion to be secure of judging properly at first        may i ask to what these questions tend        merely to the illustration of your character said she       endeavouring to shake off her gravity
i am trying to make it       out        and what is your success        she shook her head
i do not get on at all
i hear such       different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly        i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may       vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet       that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment       as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no       credit on either        but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another       opportunity        i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly       replied
she said no more and they went down the other dance and       parted in silence and on each side dissatisfied though not to       an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerably       powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and       directed all his anger against another
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her       and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her        so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george       wickham
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking       me a thousand questions and i find that the young man quite       forgot to tell you among his other communication that he was       the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward
let me       recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit       confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him       ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has always       been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated       mr darcy in a most infamous manner
i do not know the       particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the       least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham       mentioned and that though my brother thought that he could not       well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he       was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the       way
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing       indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it
i pity you       miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but       really considering his descent one could not expect much       better        his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the       same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him       of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward       and of that i can assure you he informed me himself        i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a       sneer
excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant        insolent girl said elizabeth to herself
you are much       mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as       this
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the       malice of mr darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had       undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of bingley
jane       met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such       happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was       satisfied with the occurrences of the evening
elizabeth       instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for       wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else       gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for       happiness
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling       than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham
but       perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any       third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon        no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing       satisfactory to tell you
mr bingley does not know the whole of       his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which       have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the       good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is       perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less       attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to       say by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no       means a respectable young man
i am afraid he has been very       imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard        mr
bingley does not know mr wickham himself        no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton        this account then is what he has received from mr darcy
i am       satisfied
but what does he say of the living        he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has       heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it       was left to him conditionally only        i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth       warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances       only
mr bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i       dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the       story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall       venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before        she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each       and on which there could be no difference of sentiment
elizabeth       listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which       jane entertained of mr bingleys regard and said all in her       power to heighten her confidence in it
on their being joined by       mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose       enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had       scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told       her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as       to make a most important discovery
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there       is now in the room a near relation of my patroness
i happened to       overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who       does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de       bourgh and of her mother lady catherine
how wonderfully these       sort of things occur
who would have thought of my meeting with       perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly
i       am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay       my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will       excuse my not having done it before
my total ignorance of the       connection must plead my apology        you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy        indeed i am
i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it       earlier
i believe him to be lady catherines nephew
it will       be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well       yesterday sennight        elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring       him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without       introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment       to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should       be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong       to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the       acquaintance
mr collins listened to her with the determined air       of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking       replied thus        my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world       in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of       your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a       wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst       the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me       leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in       point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided       that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time       maintained
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of       my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i       look on as a point of duty
pardon me for neglecting to profit by       your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant       guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted       by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a       young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to       attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly       watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very       evident
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and       though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it       all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology       hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see       him expose himself to such a man
mr darcy was eyeing him with       unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him       time to speak replied with an air of distant civility
mr       collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and       mr darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length       of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a       slight bow and moved another way
mr collins then returned to       elizabeth
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied       with my reception
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the       attention
he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid       me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady       catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a       favour unworthily
it was really a very handsome thought
upon       the whole i am much pleased with him        as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she       turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr       bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her       observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as       jane
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the       felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she       felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to       like bingleys two sisters
her mothers thoughts she plainly saw       were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near       her lest she might hear too much
when they sat down to supper       therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which       placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to       find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas       freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane       would soon be married to mr bingley
it was an animating       subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while       enumerating the advantages of the match
his being such a       charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from       them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was       such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane       and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as       she could do
it was moreover such a promising thing for her       younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them       in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at       her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to       the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go       into company more than she liked
it was necessary to make this       circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it       is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to       find comfort in staying home at any period of her life
she       concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be       equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing       there was no chance of it
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her       mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a       less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she       could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy       who sat opposite to them
her mother only scolded her for being       nonsensical
what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him
i       am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged       to say nothing he may not like to hear        for heavens sake madam speak lower
what advantage can it be       for you to offend mr darcy
you will never recommend yourself to       his friend by so doing        nothing that she could say however had any influence
her       mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation
she       could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though       every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was       not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his       attention was invariably fixed by her
the expression of his face       changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and       steady gravity
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady       lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights       which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts       of cold ham and chicken
elizabeth now began to revive
but not       long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over       singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing       mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the       company
by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she       endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain       mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting       was delightful to her and she began her song
elizabeths eyes       were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched       her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which       was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving       amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she       might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of       half a minute began another
marys powers were by no means       fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner       affected
elizabeth was in agonies
she looked at jane to see       how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley
she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of       derision at each other and at darcy who continued however       imperturbably grave
she looked at her father to entreat his       interference lest mary should be singing all night
he took the       hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud       that will do extremely well child
you have delighted us long       enough
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit        mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted       and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech       was afraid her anxiety had done no good
others of the party were       now applied to
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to       sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the       company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent       diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a       clergyman
i do not mean however to assert that we can be       justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there       are certainly other things to be attended to
the rector of a       parish has much to do
in the first place he must make such an       agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not       offensive to his patron
he must write his own sermons and the       time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and       the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be       excused from making as comfortable as possible
and i do not       think it of light importance that he should have attentive and       conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those       to whom he owes his preferment
i cannot acquit him of that duty       nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of       testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the       family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech       which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room
many staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr       bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins       for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to       lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young       man
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement       to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it       would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more       spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley       and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his       notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much       distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed
that his       two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an       opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she       could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman       or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement
she was       teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her       side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him       again put it out of her power to dance with others
in vain did       she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to       introduce him to any young lady in the room
he assured her that       as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief       object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and       that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her       the whole evening
there was no arguing upon such a project
she       owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often       joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr collinss       conversation to herself
she was at least free from the offense of mr darcys further       notice though often standing within a very short distance of       her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak
she       felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr       wickham and rejoiced in it
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart       and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their       carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone       which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by       some of the family
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened       their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently       impatient to have the house to themselves
they repulsed every       attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a       languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by       the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr       bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment       and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their       behaviour to their guests
darcy said nothing at all
mr bennet       in equal silence was enjoying the scene
mr bingley and jane       were standing together a little detached from the rest and       talked only to each other
elizabeth preserved as steady a       silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was       too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation       of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most       pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at       longbourn and addressed herself especially to mr bingley to       assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner       with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal       invitation
bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily       engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her       after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the       next day for a short time
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under       the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary       preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes       she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in       the course of three or four months
of having another daughter       married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and       with considerable though not equal pleasure
elizabeth was the       least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the       match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was       eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield
chapter         the next day opened a new scene at longbourn
mr collins made       his declaration in form
having resolved to do it without loss of       time as his leave of absence extended only to the following       saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it       distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a       very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed       a regular part of the business
on finding mrs bennet       elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after       breakfast he addressed the mother in these words        may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter       elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience       with her in the course of this morning        before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise       mrs bennet answered instantly oh dearyescertainly
i am       sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no       objection
come kitty i want you up stairs and gathering her       work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out        dear madam do not go
i beg you will not go
mr collins must       excuse me
he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not       hear
i am going away myself        no no nonsense lizzy
i desire you to stay where you are       and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed       looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your       staying and hearing mr collins        elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments       consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to       get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down       again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings       which were divided between distress and diversion
mrs bennet       and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins       began
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far       from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other       perfections
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had       there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to       assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for       this address
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse       however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my       attentions have been too marked to be mistaken
almost as soon as       i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my       future life
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this       subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons       for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with       the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did        the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run       away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that       she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to       stop him further and he continued        my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right       thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to       set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am       convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and       thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it       is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble       lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness
twice has she       condescended to give me her opinion unasked too
on this       subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left       hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was       arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr
collins you must marry
a clergyman like you must marry
choose       properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own       let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high       but able to make a small income go a good way
this is my advice
find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and       i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair       cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady       catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my       power to offer
you will find her manners beyond anything i can       describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable       to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect       which her rank will inevitably excite
thus much for my general       intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my       views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own       neighbourhood where i can assure you there are many amiable       young women
but the fact is that being as i am to inherit       this estate after the death of your honoured father who       however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself       without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that       the loss to them might be as little as possible when the       melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already       said may not be for several years
this has been my motive my       fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your       esteem
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the       most animated language of the violence of my affection
to       fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of       that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could       not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the four       per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers       decease is all that you may ever be entitled to
on that head       therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure       yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when       we are married        it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now
you are too hasty sir she cried
you forget that i have made       no answer
let me do it without further loss of time
accept my       thanks for the compliment you are paying me
i am very sensible       of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to       do otherwise than to decline them        i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave       of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the       addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he       first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is       repeated a second or even a third time
i am therefore by no       means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to       lead you to the altar ere long        upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather       extraordinary one after my declaration
i do assure you that i am       not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are       who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of       being asked a second time
i am perfectly serious in my refusal
you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the       last woman in the world who could make you so
nay were your       friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find       me in every respect ill qualified for the situation        were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr       collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship       would at all disapprove of you
and you may be certain when i       have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the very       highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable       qualification        indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary
you       must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment       of believing what i say
i wish you very happy and very rich and       by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being       otherwise
in making me the offer you must have satisfied the       delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take       possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any       selfreproach
this matter may be considered therefore as       finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have       quitted the room had mr collins not thus addressed her        when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the       subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than       you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of       cruelty at present because i know it to be the established       custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and       perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as       would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female       character        really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you       puzzle me exceedingly
if what i have hitherto said can appear to       you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my       refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one        you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that       your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course
my       reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to       me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance or that the       establishment i can offer would be any other than highly       desirable
my situation in life my connections with the family       of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances       highly in my favour and you should take it into further       consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is       by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be       made you
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all       likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable       qualifications
as i must therefore conclude that you are not       serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it       to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the       usual practice of elegant females        i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to       that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable       man
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed       sincere
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done       me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely       impossible
my feelings in every respect forbid it
can i speak       plainer
do not consider me now as an elegant female intending       to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth       from her heart        you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward       gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the       express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals       will not fail of being acceptable        to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would       make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew       determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals       as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose       negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive and       whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the       affectation and coquetry of an elegant female
chapter         mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his       successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the       vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw       elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the       staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated       both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their       nearer connection
mr collins received and returned these       felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate       the particulars of their interview with the result of which he       trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal       which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow       from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her       character
this information however startled mrs bennet she would have       been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to       encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared       not believe it and could not help saying so
but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall       be brought to reason
i will speak to her about it directly
she       is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own       interest but i will make her know it        pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but       if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she       would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my       situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage       state
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit       perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me       because if liable to such defects of temper she could not       contribute much to my felicity        sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed
lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these
in everything       else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived
i will go       directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with       her i am sure        she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to       her husband called out as she entered the library oh
mr       bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar
you       must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will       not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his       mind and not have her        mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and       fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the       least altered by her communication
i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she       had finished her speech
of what are you talking        of mr collins and lizzy
lizzy declares she will not have mr       collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have       lizzy        and what am i to do on the occasion
it seems an hopeless       business        speak to lizzy about it yourself
tell her that you insist upon       her marrying him        let her be called down
she shall hear my opinion        mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the       library
come here child cried her father as she appeared
i have       sent for you on an affair of importance
i understand that mr       collins has made you an offer of marriage
is it true elizabeth       replied that it was
very welland this offer of marriage you       have refused        i have sir        very well
we now come to the point
your mother insists upon       your accepting it
is it not so mrs bennet        yes or i will never see her again        an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth
from this day       you must be a stranger to one of your parents
your mother will       never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will       never see you again if you do        elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a       beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her       husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively       disappointed
what do you mean mr bennet in talking this way
you promised       me to insist upon her marrying him        my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to       request
first that you will allow me the free use of my       understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be        not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband       did mrs bennet give up the point
she talked to elizabeth again       and again coaxed and threatened her by turns
she endeavoured to       secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible       mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with       real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to       her attacks
though her manner varied however her determination       never did
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had       passed
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what       motives his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was       hurt he suffered in no other way
his regard for her was quite       imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers       reproach prevented his feeling any regret
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to       spend the day with them
she was met in the vestibule by lydia       who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are       come for there is such fun here
what do you think has happened       this morning
mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she       will not have him        charlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by       kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they       entered the breakfastroom where mrs bennet was alone than she       likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her       compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to       comply with the wishes of all her family
pray do my dear miss       lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my       side nobody takes part with me
i am cruelly used nobody feels       for my poor nerves        charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and       elizabeth
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as       unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were       at york provided she can have her own way
but i tell you miss       lizzyif you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer       of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at alland       i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father       is dead
i shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you
i       have done with you from this very day
i told you in the library       you know that i should never speak to you again and you will       find me as good as my word
i have no pleasure in talking to       undutiful children
not that i have much pleasure indeed in       talking to anybody
people who suffer as i do from nervous       complaints can have no great inclination for talking
nobody can       tell what i suffer
but it is always so
those who do not       complain are never pitied        her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that       any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase       the irritation
she talked on therefore without interruption       from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who       entered the room with an air more stately than usual and on       perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon       it that you all of you hold your tongues and let me and mr       collins have a little conversation together        elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty       followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she       could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr       collins whose enquiries after herself and all her family were       very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself       with walking to the window and pretending not to hear
in a       doleful voice mrs bennet began the projected conversation oh
mr collins        my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this       point
far be it from me he presently continued in a voice       that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your       daughter
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all       the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i       have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned
perhaps       not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had       my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often       observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the       blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our       estimation
you will not i hope consider me as showing any       disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my       pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid       yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to       interpose your authority in my behalf
my conduct may i fear be       objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your       daughters lips instead of your own
but we are all liable to       error
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair
my       object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with       due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my       manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to       apologise     chapter         the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end       and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings       necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish       allusions of her mother
as for the gentleman himself his       feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or       dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner       and resentful silence
he scarcely ever spoke to her and the       assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself       were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose       civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all       and especially to her friend
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets illhumour or       ill health
mr collins was also in the same state of angry       pride
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his       visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it
he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he meant       to stay
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to enquire if mr       wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the       netherfield ball
he joined them on their entering the town and       attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and       the concern of everybody was well talked over
to elizabeth       however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his       absence had been selfimposed
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not       meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with       him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear       and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself        she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a       full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they       civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer       walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he       particularly attended to her
his accompanying them was a double       advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and       it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her       father and mother
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet       it came from netherfield
the envelope contained a sheet of       elegant little hotpressed paper well covered with a ladys       fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance       change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some       particular passages
jane recollected herself soon and putting       the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the       general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the       subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no       sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from       jane invited her to follow her up stairs
when they had gained       their own room jane taking out the letter said        this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me       a good deal
the whole party have left netherfield by this time       and are on their way to townand without any intention of coming       back again
you shall hear what she says        she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the       information of their having just resolved to follow their brother       to town directly and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor       street where mr hurst had a house
the next was in these words       i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in       hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we       will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that       delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may       lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most       unreserved correspondence
i depend on you for that to these       highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the       insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their       removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it       was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would       prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their       society she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it in       the enjoyment of his
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should       not be able to see your friends before they leave the country
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which       miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware       and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends       will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters
mr       bingley will not be detained in london by them        caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into       hertfordshire this winter
i will read it to you        when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business       which took him to london might be concluded in three or four       days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time       convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry       to leave it again we have determined on following him thither       that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a       comfortless hotel
many of my acquaintances are already there for       the winter i wish that i could hear that you my dearest friend       had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that i       despair
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may       abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and       that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling       the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you        it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more       this winter        it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he       should        why will you think so
it must be his own doing
he is his own       master
but you do not know all
i will read you the passage       which particularly hurts me
i will have no reserves from you        mr
darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the       truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again
i really       do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance       and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and       myself is heightened into something still more interesting from       the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister
i       do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on       this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding       them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable
my       brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent       opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her       relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a       sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call       charles most capable of engaging any womans heart
with all       these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to       prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of       an event which will secure the happiness of so many        what do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane       as she finished it
is it not clear enough
does it not       expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to       be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers       indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings       for him she means most kindly
to put me on my guard
can       there be any other opinion on the subject        yes there can for mine is totally different
will you hear       it        most willingly        you shall have it in a few words
miss bingley sees that her       brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy
she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there and tries       to persuade you that he does not care about you        jane shook her head
indeed jane you ought to believe me
no one who has ever seen       you together can doubt his affection
miss bingley i am sure       cannot
she is not such a simpleton
could she have seen half as       much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her       wedding clothes
but the case is this we are not rich enough or       grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss       darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been       one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a       second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare       say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way
but       my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss       bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is       in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he       took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to       persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very       much in love with her friend        if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your       representation of all this might make me quite easy
but i know       the foundation is unjust
caroline is incapable of wilfully       deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that       she is deceiving herself        that is right
you could not have started a more happy idea       since you will not take comfort in mine
believe her to be       deceived by all means
you have now done your duty by her and       must fret no longer        but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in       accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to       marry elsewhere        you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon       mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his       two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his       wife i advise you by all means to refuse him        how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling
you must know       that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their       disapprobation i could not hesitate        i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot       consider your situation with much compassion        but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be       required
a thousand things may arise in six months        the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the       utmost contempt
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of       carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment       suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken       could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she       felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its       happy effect
janes temper was not desponding and she was       gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection       sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to       netherfield and answer every wish of her heart
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of       the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans       conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great       deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that       the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting       so intimate together
after lamenting it however at some       length she had the consolation that mr bingley would be soon       down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of       all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been       invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two       full courses
chapter         the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again       during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen       to mr collins
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her
it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged       to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her       satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for       the little sacrifice of her time
this was very amiable but       charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any       conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her       from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them       towards herself
such was miss lucass scheme and appearances       were so favourable that when they parted at night she would       have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave       hertfordshire so very soon
but here she did injustice to the       fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape       out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness       and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet
he was       anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction       that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture       his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till       its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost       secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably       encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure       of wednesday
his reception however was of the most flattering       kind
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked       towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally       in the lane
but little had she dared to hope that so much love       and eloquence awaited her there
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow       everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both       and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name       the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such       a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no       inclination to trifle with his happiness
the stupidity with       which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any       charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss       lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested       desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment       were gained
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their       consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity
mr       collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for       their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his       prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair
lady lucas       began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter       had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was       likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion       that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the       longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and       his wife should make their appearance at st jamess
the whole       family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion
the       younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner       than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved       from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid
charlotte herself was tolerably composed
she had gained her       point and had time to consider of it
her reflections were in       general satisfactory
mr collins to be sure was neither       sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his       attachment to her must be imaginary
but still he would be her       husband
without thinking highly either of men or matrimony       marriage had always been her object it was the only provision       for welleducated young women of small fortune and however       uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest       preservative from want
this preservative she had now obtained       and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been       handsome she felt all the good luck of it
the least agreeable       circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to       elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any       other person
elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame       her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings       must be hurt by such a disapprobation
she resolved to give her       the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when       he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had       passed before any of the family
a promise of secrecy was of       course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without       difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst       forth in such very direct questions on his return as required       some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising       great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous       love
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any       of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when       the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great       politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see       him at longbourn again whenever his engagements might allow him       to visit them
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly       gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and       you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon       as possible        they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means       wish for so speedy a return immediately said        but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here       my good sir
you had better neglect your relations than run the       risk of offending your patroness        my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to       you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not       taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence        you cannot be too much upon your guard
risk anything rather       than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by       your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly       probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall       take no offence        believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such       affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily       receive from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other       mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire
as for my       fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render       it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health       and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth        with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them       equally surprised that he meditated a quick return
mrs bennet       wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his       addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been       prevailed on to accept him
she rated his abilities much higher       than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections       which often struck her and though by no means so clever as       herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve       himself by such an example as hers he might become a very       agreeable companion
but on the following morning every hope of       this kind was done away
miss lucas called soon after breakfast       and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of       the day before
the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with       her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or       two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far       from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her       astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first       the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out        engaged to mr collins
my dear charlotteimpossible        the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling       her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so       direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected       she soon regained her composure and calmly replied        why should you be surprised my dear eliza
do you think it       incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any womans       good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with       you        but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong       effort for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that       the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her       and that she wished her all imaginable happiness
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte
you must be       surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr collins was       wishing to marry you
but when you have had time to think it       over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done
i am       not romantic you know i never was
i ask only a comfortable       home and considering mr collinss character connection and       situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness       with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the       marriage state        elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward       pause they returned to the rest of the family
charlotte did not       stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what       she had heard
it was a long time before she became at all       reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match
the strangeness       of mr collinss making two offers of marriage within three days       was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted
she had       always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly       like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible that       when called into action she would have sacrificed every better       feeling to worldly advantage
charlotte the wife of mr collins       was a most humiliating picture
and to the pang of a friend       disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the       distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to       be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen
chapter         elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on       what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to       mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his       daughter to announce her engagement to the family
with many       compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of       a connection between the houses he unfolded the matterto an       audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet       with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be       entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil       boisterously exclaimed        good lord
sir william how can you tell such a story
do not       you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy        nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne       without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding       carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be       positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all       their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so       unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his       account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte       herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her       mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to       sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by       making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be       expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins       and the convenient distance of hunsford from london
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal       while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than       her feelings found a rapid vent
in the first place she       persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she       was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she       trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly       that the match might be broken off
two inferences however were       plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real       cause of the mischief and the other that she herself had been       barbarously misused by them all and on these two points she       principally dwelt during the rest of the day
nothing could       console and nothing could appease her
nor did that day wear out       her resentment
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth       without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak       to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months       were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion       and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most       agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that       charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably       sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his       daughter
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she       said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for       their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it       as improbable
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas       for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no       other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to       retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well       married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to       say how happy she was though mrs bennets sour looks and       illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness       away
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept       them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded       that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard       to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her       opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew       daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and       nothing more was heard of his return
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was       counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on       tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the       solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family       might have prompted
after discharging his conscience on that       head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous       expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of       their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it       was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been       so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at       longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday       fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his       marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible       which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his       amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the       happiest of men
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of       pleasure to mrs bennet
on the contrary she was as much       disposed to complain of it as her husband
it was very strange       that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it       was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome
she hated       having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent       and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable
such were       the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the       greater distress of mr bingleys continued absence
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject
day       after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him       than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming       no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly       incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as       a most scandalous falsehood
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut       that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes       happiness and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover she       could not prevent its frequently occurring
the united efforts of       his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend       assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of       london might be too much she feared for the strength of his       attachment
as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course       more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was       desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth       therefore the subject was never alluded to
but as no such       delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which       she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his       arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come       back she would think herself very ill used
it needed all janes       steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable       tranquillity
mr collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but his       reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been       on his first introduction
he was too happy however to need       much attention and luckily for the others the business of       lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company
the       chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he       sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology       for his absence before the family went to bed
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state
the very mention       of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of       illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it       talked of
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her
as her       successor in that house she regarded her with jealous       abhorrence
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded       her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she       spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were       talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself       and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were       dead
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that       charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i       should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take       her place in it        my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts
let us hope       for better things
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the       survivor        this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore       instead of making any answer she went on as before
i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate
if       it was not for the entail i should not mind it        what should not you mind        i should not mind anything at all        let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such       insensibility        i never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the       entail
how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an       estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for       the sake of mr collins too
why should he have it more than       anybody else        i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet
chapter         miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt
the very       first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled       in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret       at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in       hertfordshire before he left the country
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the       rest of the letter she found little except the professed       affection of the writer that could give her any comfort
miss       darcys praise occupied the chief of it
her many attractions       were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their       increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment       of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter
she       wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate       of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of       the latter with regard to new furniture
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all       this heard it in silent indignation
her heart was divided       between concern for her sister and resentment against all       others
to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to       miss darcy she paid no credit
that he was really fond of jane       she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had       always been disposed to like him she could not think without       anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that       want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his       designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness       to the caprice of their inclination
had his own happiness       however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to       sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her       sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible       himself
it was a subject in short on which reflection would be       long indulged and must be unavailing
she could think of nothing       else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or       were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been       aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his       observation whatever were the case though her opinion of him       must be materially affected by the difference her sisters       situation remained the same her peace equally wounded
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her       feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them       together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield       and its master she could not help saying        oh that my dear mother had more command over herself
she can       have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual       reflections on him
but i will not repine
it cannot last long
he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before        elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but       said nothing
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have       no reason
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my       acquaintance but that is all
i have nothing either to hope or       fear and nothing to reproach him with
thank god
i have not       that pain
a little time thereforei shall certainly try to       get the better        with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort       immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on       my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself        my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good
your       sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know       what to say to you
i feel as if i had never done you justice or       loved you as you deserve        miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw       back the praise on her sisters warm affection
nay said elizabeth this is not fair
you wish to think all       the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody
i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself       against it
do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my       encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill
you need       not
there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of       whom i think well
the more i see of the world the more am i       dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the       inconsistency of all human characters and of the little       dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or       sense
i have met with two instances lately one i will not       mention the other is charlottes marriage
it is unaccountable
in every view it is unaccountable        my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these
they       will ruin your happiness
you do not make allowance enough for       difference of situation and temper
consider mr collinss       respectability and charlottes steady prudent character
remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune       it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for       everybodys sake that she may feel something like regard and       esteem for our cousin        to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no       one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i       persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only       think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart
my       dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded       silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as       well as i do that the woman who married him cannot have a proper       way of thinking
you shall not defend her though it is charlotte       lucas
you shall not for the sake of one individual change the       meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade       yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility       of danger security for happiness        i must think your language too strong in speaking of both       replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing       them happy together
but enough of this
you alluded to something       else
you mentioned two instances
i cannot misunderstand you       but i entreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that       person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk
we must       not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured
we must       not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and       circumspect
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that       deceives us
women fancy admiration means more than it does        and men take care that they should        if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have       no idea of there being so much design in the world as some       persons imagine        i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to       design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to       make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery
thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings       and want of resolution will do the business        and do you impute it to either of those        yes to the last
but if i go on i shall displease you by       saying what i think of persons you esteem
stop me whilst you       can        you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him        yes in conjunction with his friend        i cannot believe it
why should they try to influence him
they       can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no       other woman can secure it        your first position is false
they may wish many things besides       his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and       consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the       importance of money great connections and pride        beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied       jane but this may be from better feelings than you are       supposing
they have known her much longer than they have known       me no wonder if they love her better
but whatever may be their       own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their       brothers
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it       unless there were something very objectionable
if they believed       him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so       they could not succeed
by supposing such an affection you make       everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy
do       not distress me by the idea
i am not ashamed of having been       mistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison       of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters
let       me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be       understood        elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr       bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning       no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did       not account for it clearly there was little chance of her ever       considering it with less perplexity
her daughter endeavoured to       convince her of what she did not believe herself that his       attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and       transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but       though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time       she had the same story to repeat every day
mrs bennets best       comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer
mr bennet treated the matter differently
so lizzy said he       one day your sister is crossed in love i find
i congratulate       her
next to being married a girl likes to be crossed a little       in love now and then
it is something to think of and it gives       her a sort of distinction among her companions
when is your turn       to come
you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane
now is       your time
here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all       the young ladies in the country
let wickham be your man
he is a       pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably        thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me
we       must not all expect janes good fortune        true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that       whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate       mother who will make the most of it        mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the       gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of       the longbourn family
they saw him often and to his other       recommendations was now added that of general unreserve
the       whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr       darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly       acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to       know how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had       known anything of the matter
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might       be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the       society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always       pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut       by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men
chapter         after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of       felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by       the arrival of saturday
the pain of separation however might       be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of       his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his       return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to       make him the happiest of men
he took leave of his relations at       longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair       cousins health and happiness again and promised their father       another letter of thanks
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of       receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend       the christmas at longbourn
mr gardiner was a sensible       gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by       nature as education
the netherfield ladies would have had       difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within       view of his own warehouses could have been so wellbred and       agreeable
mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs       bennet and mrs phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant       woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces
between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a       particular regard
they had frequently been staying with her in       town
the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to       distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions
when       this was done she had a less active part to play
it became her       turn to listen
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and       much to complain of
they had all been very illused since she       last saw her sister
two of her girls had been upon the point of       marriage and after all there was nothing in it
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got       mr bingley if she could
but lizzy
oh sister
it is very hard       to think that she might have been mr collinss wife by this       time had it not been for her own perverseness
he made her an       offer in this very room and she refused him
the consequence of       it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i       have and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as       ever
the lucases are very artful people indeed sister
they are       all for what they can get
i am sorry to say it of them but so       it is
it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in       my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves       before anybody else
however your coming just at this time is       the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you       tell us of long sleeves        mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given       before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with       her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her       nieces turned the conversation
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the       subject
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for       jane said she
i am sorry it went off
but these things happen       so often
a young man such as you describe mr bingley so       easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when       accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort       of inconsistencies are very frequent        an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it       will not do for us
we do not suffer by accident
it does not       often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a       young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom       he was violently in love with only a few days before        but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so       doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea
it is       as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours       acquaintance as to a real strong attachment
pray how violent       was mr bingleys love        i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite       inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her
every       time they met it was more decided and remarkable
at his own       ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to       dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an       answer
could there be finer symptoms
is not general incivility       the very essence of love        oh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt
poor jane
i am sorry for her because with her disposition she       may not get over it immediately
it had better have happened to       you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner
but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us
change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief       from home may be as useful as anything        elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt       persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard       to this young man will influence her
we live in so different a       part of town all our connections are so different and as you       well know we go out so little that it is very improbable that       they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her        and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of       his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on       jane in such a part of london
my dear aunt how could you think       of it
mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as       gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution       enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter       it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him        so much the better
i hope they will not meet at all
but does       not jane correspond with his sister
she will not be able to       help calling        she will drop the acquaintance entirely        but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to       place this point as well as the still more interesting one of       bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude       on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did       not consider it entirely hopeless
it was possible and sometimes       she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated       and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the       more natural influence of janes attractions
miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the       bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than       as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her       brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without       any danger of seeing him
the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the       phillipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day       without its engagement
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for       the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not       once sit down to a family dinner
when the engagement was for       home some of the officers always made part of itof which       officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions       mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm       commendation narrowly observed them both
without supposing       them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their       preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little       uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject       before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the       imprudence of encouraging such an attachment
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure       unconnected with his general powers
about ten or a dozen years       ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in       that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged
they had       therefore many acquaintances in common and though wickham had       been little there since the death of darcys father it was yet       in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former       friends than she had been in the way of procuring
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by       character perfectly well
here consequently was an inexhaustible       subject of discourse
in comparing her recollection of pemberley       with the minute description which wickham could give and in       bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late       possessor she was delighting both him and herself
on being made       acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she       tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition       when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at       last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy       formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy
chapter         mrs gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly       given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her       alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went       on        you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely       because you are warned against it and therefore i am not       afraid of speaking openly
seriously i would have you be on your       guard
do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an       affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent
i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting       young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should       think you could not do better
but as it is you must not let       your fancy run away with you
you have sense and we all expect       you to use it
your father would depend on your resolution and       good conduct i am sure
you must not disappoint your father        my dear aunt this is being serious indeed        yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise        well then you need not be under any alarm
i will take care of       myself and of mr wickham too
he shall not be in love with me       if i can prevent it        elizabeth you are not serious now        i beg your pardon i will try again
at present i am not in love       with mr wickham no i certainly am not
but he is beyond all       comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes       really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should       not
i see the imprudence of it
oh
that abominable mr darcy
my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i       should be miserable to forfeit it
my father however is partial       to mr wickham
in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to       be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every       day that where there is affection young people are seldom       withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into       engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than       so many of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even       to know that it would be wisdom to resist
all that i can promise       you therefore is not to be in a hurry
i will not be in a hurry       to believe myself his first object
when i am in company with       him i will not be wishing
in short i will do my best        perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so       very often
at least you should not remind your mother of       inviting him        as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile       very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that
but do       not imagine that he is always here so often
it is on your       account that he has been so frequently invited this week
you       know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company       for her friends
but really and upon my honour i will try to do       what i think to be the wisest and now i hope you are satisfied        her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked       her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful       instance of advice being given on such a point without being       resented
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been       quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode       with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs       bennet
his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at       length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even       repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished       they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on       wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose       to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and       reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself       accompanied her out of the room
as they went downstairs       together charlotte said        i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza        that you certainly shall        and i have another favour to ask you
will you come and see me        we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire        i am not likely to leave kent for some time
promise me       therefore to come to hunsford        elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in       the visit
my father and maria are coming to me in march added charlotte       and i hope you will consent to be of the party
indeed eliza       you will be as welcome as either of them        the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent       from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to       hear on the subject as usual
elizabeth soon heard from her       friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as       it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was       impossible
elizabeth could never address her without feeling       that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined       not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what       had been rather than what was
charlottes first letters were       received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be       curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she       would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce       herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt       that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she       might have foreseen
she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with       comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise
the       house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her       taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and       obliging
it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings       rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait       for her own visit there to know the rest
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce       their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth       hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as       impatience generally is
jane had been a week in town without       either seeing or hearing from caroline
she accounted for it       however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from       longbourn had by some accident been lost
my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of       the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in       grosvenor street        she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss       bingley
i did not think caroline in spirits were her words       but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving       her no notice of my coming to london
i was right therefore my       last letter had never reached her
i enquired after their       brother of course
he was well but so much engaged with mr       darcy that they scarcely ever saw him
i found that miss darcy       was expected to dinner
i wish i could see her
my visit was not       long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out
i dare say i       shall see them soon here        elizabeth shook her head over this letter
it convinced her that       accident only could discover to mr bingley her sisters being in       town
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him
she       endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but       she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention
after       waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing       every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last       appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the       alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no       longer
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister       will prove what she felt
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in       her better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to       have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me
but       my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not       think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her       behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion
i       do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate       with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am       sure i should be deceived again
caroline did not return my visit       till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the       meantime
when she did come it was very evident that she had no       pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not       calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and       was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went       away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no       longer
i pity though i cannot help blaming her
she was very       wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every       advance to intimacy began on her side
but i pity her because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am       very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it
i need       not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to       be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account       for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his       sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural       and amiable
i cannot but wonder however at her having any such       fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have       met long ago
he knows of my being in town i am certain from       something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner       of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is       really partial to miss darcy
i cannot understand it
if i were       not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say       that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this
but i       will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of       what will make me happyyour affection and the invariable       kindness of my dear uncle and aunt
let me hear from you very       soon
miss bingley said something of his never returning to       netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any       certainty
we had better not mention it
i am extremely glad that       you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford
pray go to see them with sir william and maria
i am sure you       will be very comfortable thereyours etc        this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as       she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister       at least
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely       over
she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions
his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for       him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped       he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams       account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown       away
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise       concerning that gentleman and required information and       elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to       her aunt than to herself
his apparent partiality had subsided       his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it       and write of it without material pain
her heart had been but       slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing       that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted       it
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most       remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering       himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in       this case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his       wish of independence
nothing on the contrary could be more       natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few       struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and       desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him       happy
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating       the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear       aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really       experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present       detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil
but my       feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even       impartial towards miss king
i cannot find out that i hate her at       all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good       sort of girl
there can be no love in all this
my watchfulness       has been effectual and though i certainly should be a more       interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in       love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative       insignificance
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do
they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the       mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something       to live on as well as the plain     chapter         with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and       otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton       sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass       away
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford
she had not at       first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she       soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned       to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater       certainty
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte       again and weakened her disgust of mr collins
there was novelty       in the scheme and as with such a mother and such       uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little       change was not unwelcome for its own sake
the journey would       moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew       near she would have been very sorry for any delay
everything       however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to       charlottes first sketch
she was to accompany sir william and       his second daughter
the improvement of spending a night in       london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan       could be
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss       her and who when it came to the point so little liked her       going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to       answer her letter
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly       friendly on his side even more
his present pursuit could not       make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and       to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the       first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu       wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to       expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of       hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide there was a       solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to       him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced       that whether married or single he must always be her model of       the amiable and pleasing
her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her       think him less agreeable
sir william lucas and his daughter       maria a goodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had       nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to       with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise
elizabeth       loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long
he       could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and       knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his       information
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so       early as to be in gracechurch street by noon
as they drove to       mr gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching       their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to       welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was       pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever
on the stairs       were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their       cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the       drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a       twelvemonth prevented their coming lower
all was joy and       kindness
the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in       bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt
their first object       was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear       in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always       struggled to support her spirits there were periods of       dejection
it was reasonable however to hope that they would       not continue long
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of       miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and repeated       conversations occurring at different times between jane and       herself which proved that the former had from her heart given       up the acquaintance
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and       complimented her on bearing it so well
but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss       king
i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary        pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial       affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive
where does       discretion end and avarice begin
last christmas you were afraid       of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now       because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds       you want to find out that he is mercenary        if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall       know what to think        she is a very good kind of girl i believe
i know no harm of       her        but he paid her not the smallest attention till her       grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune        nowhy should he
if it were not allowable for him to gain my       affections because i had no money what occasion could there be       for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was       equally poor        but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions       towards her so soon after this event        a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those       elegant decorums which other people may observe
if she does       not object to it why should we        her not objecting does not justify him
it only shows her       being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling        well cried elizabeth have it as you choose
he shall be       mercenary and she shall be foolish        no lizzy that is what i do not choose
i should be sorry       you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in       derbyshire        oh
if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who       live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in       hertfordshire are not much better
i am sick of them all
thank       heaven
i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not       one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to       recommend him
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after       all        take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of       disappointment        before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had       the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle       and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the       summer
we have not determined how far it shall carry us said mrs       gardiner but perhaps to the lakes        no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her       acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful
oh my       dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight
what       felicity
you give me fresh life and vigour
adieu to       disappointment and spleen
what are young men to rocks and       mountains
oh
what hours of transport we shall spend
and when       we do return it shall not be like other travellers without       being able to give one accurate idea of anything
we will know       where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen
lakes       mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our       imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular       scene will we begin quarreling about its relative situation
let       our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the       generality of travellers     chapter         every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to       elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she       had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her       health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant       source of delight
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye       was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to       bring it in view
the palings of rosings park was their boundary       on one side
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she       had heard of its inhabitants
at length the parsonage was discernible
the garden sloping to       the road the house standing in it the green pales and the       laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving
mr collins       and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at       the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house       amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party
in a moment they       were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and       elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found       herself so affectionately received
she saw instantly that her       cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal       civility was just what it had been and he detained her some       minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all       her family
they were then with no other delay than his pointing       out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as       soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time       with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually       repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not       help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the       room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself       particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had       lost in refusing him
but though everything seemed neat and       comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of       repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she       could have so cheerful an air with such a companion
when mr       collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be       ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily       turned her eye on charlotte
once or twice she could discern a       faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear
after       sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the       room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of       their journey and of all that had happened in london mr       collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was       large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he       attended himself
to work in this garden was one of his most       respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of       countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of       the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible
here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and       scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked       for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left       beauty entirely behind
he could number the fields in every       direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most       distant clump
but of all the views which his garden or which       the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with       the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that       bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house
it was       a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two       meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the       remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william       accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the       house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity       of showing it without her husbands help
it was rather small       but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and       arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave       charlotte all the credit
when mr collins could be forgotten       there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by       charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must       be often forgotten
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the       country
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when       mr collins joining in observed        yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady       catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need       not say you will be delighted with her
she is all affability and       condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some       portion of her notice when service is over
i have scarcely any       hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in       every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming
we dine at       rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home
her       ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us
i should say       one of her ladyships carriages for she has several        lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed       added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour        very true my dear that is exactly what i say
she is the sort       of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference        the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news       and telling again what had already been written and when it       closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to       meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand       her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her       husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well
she       had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor       of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr       collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings
a       lively imagination soon settled it all
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting       ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole       house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard       somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly       after her
she opened the door and met maria in the landing       place who breathless with agitation cried out        oh my dear eliza
pray make haste and come into the       diningroom for there is such a sight to be seen
i will not       tell you what it is
make haste and come down this moment        elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing       more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the       lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a       low phaeton at the garden gate
and is this all cried elizabeth
i expected at least that the       pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady       catherine and her daughter        la
my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is       not lady catherine
the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives       with them the other is miss de bourgh
only look at her
she is       quite a little creature
who would have thought that she could be       so thin and small        she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all       this wind
why does she not come in        oh charlotte says she hardly ever does
it is the greatest of       favours when miss de bourgh comes in        i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas
she looks sickly and cross
yes she will do for him very well
she will make him a very proper wife        mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in       conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths       high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest       contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing       whenever miss de bourgh looked that way
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on       and the others returned into the house
mr collins no sooner saw       the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good       fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the       whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day
chapter         mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was       complete
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness       to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility       towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for       and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was       such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew       not how to admire enough
i confess said he that i should not have been at all       surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and       spend the evening at rosings
i rather expected from my       knowledge of her affability that it would happen
but who could       have foreseen such an attention as this
who could have imagined       that we should receive an invitation to dine there an       invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately       after your arrival        i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir       william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great       really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire
about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not       uncommon        scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but       their visit to rosings
mr collins was carefully instructing       them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms       so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly       overpower them
when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to       elizabeth        do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us       which becomes herself and her daughter
i would advise you merely       to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere       is no occasion for anything more
lady catherine will not think       the worse of you for being simply dressed
she likes to have the       distinction of rank preserved        while they were dressing he came two or three times to their       different doors to recommend their being quick as lady       catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of       living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to       company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings       with as much apprehension as her father had done to his       presentation at st jamess
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a       mile across the park
every park has its beauty and its       prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she       could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene       to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of       the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the       glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh
when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every       moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly       calm
elizabeths courage did not fail her
she had heard nothing       of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary       talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money       or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation
from the entrancehall of which mr collins pointed out with a       rapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments       they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room       where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were       sitting
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive       them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that       the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a       proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he       would have thought necessary
in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so       completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but       just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat       without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of       her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way       to look
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and       could observe the three ladies before her composedly
lady       catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features       which might once have been handsome
her air was not       conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to       make her visitors forget their inferior rank
she was not       rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken       in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and       brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the       observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to       be exactly what he represented
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and       deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she       turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in       marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small
there was       neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies
miss       de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain       were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low       voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing       remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she       said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her       eyes
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the       windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point       out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that       it was much better worth looking at in the summer
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the       servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had       promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at       the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as       if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater
he carved       and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was       commended first by him and then by sir william who was now       enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said in a       manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear
but       lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration       and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the       table proved a novelty to them
the party did not supply much       conversation
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an       opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de       bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady       catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinnertime
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss       de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing       she was indisposed
maria thought speaking out of the question       and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to       be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without       any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on       every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not       used to have her judgement controverted
she enquired into       charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a       great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her       how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as       hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her       poultry
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great       ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of       dictating to others
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs       collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and       elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she       knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very       genteel pretty kind of girl
she asked her at different times       how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than       herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether       they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage       her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered       them very composedly
lady catherine then observed        your fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think
for       your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise       i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line
it       was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family
do you       play and sing miss bennet        a little        oh
thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you
our       instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try       it some day
do your sisters play and sing        one of them does        why did not you all learn
you ought all to have learned
the       miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income       as yours
do you draw        no not at all        what none of you        not one        that is very strange
but i suppose you had no opportunity
your       mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit       of masters        my mother would have had no objection but my father hates       london        has your governess left you        we never had any governess        no governess
how was that possible
five daughters brought up       at home without a governess
i never heard of such a thing
your       mother must have been quite a slave to your education        elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had       not been the case
then who taught you
who attended to you
without a governess       you must have been neglected        compared with some families i believe we were but such of us       as wished to learn never wanted the means
we were always       encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary
those who chose to be idle certainly might        aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if       i had known your mother i should have advised her most       strenuously to engage one
i always say that nothing is to be       done in education without steady and regular instruction and       nobody but a governess can give it
it is wonderful how many       families i have been the means of supplying in that way
i am       always glad to get a young person well placed out
four nieces of       mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means       and it was but the other day that i recommended another young       person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the       family are quite delighted with her
mrs collins did i tell you       of lady metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me
she finds miss       pope a treasure
lady catherine said she you have given me a       treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet        yes maam all        all
what all five out at once
very odd
and you only the       second
the younger ones out before the elder ones are married
your younger sisters must be very young        yes my youngest is not sixteen
perhaps she is full young to       be much in company
but really maam i think it would be very       hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share       of society and amusement because the elder may not have the       means or inclination to marry early
the lastborn has as good a       right to the pleasures of youth as the first
and to be kept back       on such a motive
i think it would not be very likely to       promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind        upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very       decidedly for so young a person
pray what is your age        with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth       smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it        lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct       answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature       who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence
you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need       not conceal your age        i am not oneandtwenty        when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the       cardtables were placed
lady catherine sir william and mr and       mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose       to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting       mrs jenkinson to make up her party
their table was       superlatively stupid
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did       not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her       fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having       too much or too little light
a great deal more passed at the       other table
lady catherine was generally speakingstating the       mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of       herself
mr collins was employed in agreeing to everything her       ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and       apologising if he thought he won too many
sir william did not       say much
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble       names
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they       chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to       mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered
the       party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine       determine what weather they were to have on the morrow
from       these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the       coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collinss       side and as many bows on sir williams they departed
as soon as       they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her       cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings       which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it       really was
but her commendation though costing her some       trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very       soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands
chapter         sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was       long enough to convince him of his daughters being most       comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and       such a neighbour as were not often met with
while sir william       was with them mr collins devoted his morning to driving him out       in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away       the whole family returned to their usual employments and       elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her       cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between       breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the       garden or in reading and writing and looking out of the window       in his own bookroom which fronted the road
the room in which       the ladies sat was backwards
elizabeth had at first rather       wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for       common use it was a better sized room and had a more pleasant       aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason       for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been       much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally       lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane       and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what       carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh       drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform       them of though it happened almost every day
she not       unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes       conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon       to get out
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to       rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it       necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that       there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could       not understand the sacrifice of so many hours
now and then they       were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped       her observation that was passing in the room during these visits
she examined into their employments looked at their work and       advised them to do it differently found fault with the       arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in       negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it       only for the sake of finding out that mrs collinss joints of       meat were too large for her family
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in       the commission of the peace of the county she was a most active       magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were       carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers       were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she       sallied forth into the village to settle their differences       silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a       week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being       only one cardtable in the evening every such entertainment was       the counterpart of the first
their other engagements were few       as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond       mr collinss reach
this however was no evil to elizabeth and       upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were       halfhours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the       weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great       enjoyment out of doors
her favourite walk and where she       frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine       was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where       there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but       herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines       curiosity
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed       away
easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to       bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a       circle must be important
elizabeth had heard soon after her       arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few       weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom       she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively       new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused       in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his       behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by       lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest       satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration       and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been       frequently seen by miss lucas and herself
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was       walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into       hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and       after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park       hurried home with the great intelligence
on the following       morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects
there were       two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had       brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his       uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party when       mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him
charlotte       had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and       immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour       they might expect adding        i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility
mr darcy       would never have come so soon to wait upon me        elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the       compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell       and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room
colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not       handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman
mr       darcy looked just as he had been used to look in       hertfordshirepaid his compliments with his usual reserve to       mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings toward her       friend met her with every appearance of composure
elizabeth       merely curtseyed to him without saying a word
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the       readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very       pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight       observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some       time without speaking to anybody
at length however his       civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the       health of her family
she answered him in the usual way and       after a moments pause added        my eldest sister has been in town these three months
have you       never happened to see her there        she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to       see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed       between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little       confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to       meet miss bennet
the subject was pursued no farther and the       gentlemen soon afterwards went away
chapter         colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the       parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably       to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings
it was some       days however before they received any invitation thitherfor       while there were visitors in the house they could not be       necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after       the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an       attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to       come there in the evening
for the last week they had seen very       little of lady catherine or her daughter
colonel fitzwilliam had       called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr       darcy they had seen only at church
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they       joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom
her ladyship       received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by       no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she       was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them       especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the       room
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was       a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty       friend had moreover caught his fancy very much
he now seated       himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and       hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books       and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained       in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and       flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well       as of mr darcy
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned       towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship       after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged       for she did not scruple to call out        what is that you are saying fitzwilliam
what is it you are       talking of
what are you telling miss bennet
let me hear what it       is        we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able       to avoid a reply
of music
then pray speak aloud
it is of all subjects my       delight
i must have my share in the conversation if you are       speaking of music
there are few people in england i suppose       who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better       natural taste
if i had ever learnt i should have been a great       proficient
and so would anne if her health had allowed her to       apply
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully
how does georgiana get on darcy        mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters       proficiency
i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady       catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to       excel if she does not practice a good deal        i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such       advice
she practises very constantly        so much the better
it cannot be done too much and when i next       write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any       account
i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is       to be acquired without constant practice
i have told miss bennet       several times that she will never play really well unless she       practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is       very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every       day and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinsons room
she       would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house        mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding and       made no answer
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of       having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the       instrument
he drew a chair near her
lady catherine listened to       half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew       till the latter walked away from her and making with his usual       deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to       command a full view of the fair performers countenance
elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient       pause turned to him with an arch smile and said        you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state       to hear me
i will not be alarmed though your sister does play       so well
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to       be frightened at the will of others
my courage always rises at       every attempt to intimidate me        i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you       could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming       you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough       to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing       opinions which in fact are not your own        elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said       to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty       notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say
i am       particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose       my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to       pass myself off with some degree of credit
indeed mr darcy it       is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my       disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very       impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such       things may come out as will shock your relations to hear        i am not afraid of you said he smilingly
pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel       fitzwilliam
i should like to know how he behaves among       strangers        you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very       dreadful
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire       you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think       he did
he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce       and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was       sitting down in want of a partner
mr darcy you cannot deny the       fact        i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the       assembly beyond my own party        true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom
well       colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next
my fingers wait your       orders        perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought       an introduction but i am illqualified to recommend myself to       strangers        shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth       still addressing colonel fitzwilliam
shall we ask him why a man       of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill       qualified to recommend himself to strangers        i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying       to him
it is because he will not give himself the trouble        i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said       darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before
i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested       in their concerns as i often see done        my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument       in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do
they have       not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same       expression
but then i have always supposed it to be my own       faultbecause i will not take the trouble of practising
it is       not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other       womans of superior execution        darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right
you have       employed your time much better
no one admitted to the privilege       of hearing you can think anything wanting
we neither of us       perform to strangers        here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to       know what they were talking of
elizabeth immediately began       playing again
lady catherine approached and after listening       for a few minutes said to darcy        miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more       and could have the advantage of a london master
she has a very       good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to       annes
anne would have been a delightful performer had her       health allowed her to learn        elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his       cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other       could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his       behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss       bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her       had she been his relation
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance       mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility       and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument       till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home
chapter         elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to       jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the       village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain       signal of a visitor
as she had heard no carriage she thought it       not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension       was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape       all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very       great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for       his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the       ladies were to be within
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were       made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence
it was       absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in       this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in       hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on       the subject of their hasty departure she observed        how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr       darcy
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley       to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he       went but the day before
he and his sisters were well i hope       when you left london        perfectly so i thank you        she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a       short pause added        i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of       ever returning to netherfield again        i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may       spend very little of his time there in the future
he has many       friends and is at a time of life when friends and engagements       are continually increasing        if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better       for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely       for then we might possibly get a settled family there
but       perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the       convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must       expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle        i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it       up as soon as any eligible purchase offers        elizabeth made no answer
she was afraid of talking longer of his       friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to       leave the trouble of finding a subject to him
he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very       comfortable house
lady catherine i believe did a great deal to       it when mr collins first came to hunsford        i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her       kindness on a more grateful object        mr
collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a       wife        yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with       one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him       or have made him happy if they had
my friend has an excellent       understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her       marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did
she seems       perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is       certainly a very good match for her        it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a       distance of her own family and friends        an easy distance do you call it
it is nearly fifty miles        and what is fifty miles of good road
little more than half a       days journey
yes i call it a very easy distance        i should never have considered the distance as one of the       advantages of the match cried elizabeth
i should never have       said mrs collins was settled near her family        it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire
anything       beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would       appear far        as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she       understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and       netherfield and she blushed as she answered        i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near       her family
the far and the near must be relative and depend on       many varying circumstances
where there is fortune to make the       expenses of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil
but       that is not the case here
mr and mrs collins have a       comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent       journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself       near her family under less than half the present distance        mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you       cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment
you       cannot have been always at longbourn        elizabeth looked surprised
the gentleman experienced some change       of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the       table and glancing over it said in a colder voice        are you pleased with kent        a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either       side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of       charlotte and her sister just returned from her walk
the       ttette surprised them
mr darcy related the mistake which       had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a       few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away
what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he       was gone
my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he       would never have called on us in this familiar way        but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very       likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after       various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to       proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was       the more probable from the time of year
all field sports were       over
within doors there was lady catherine books and a       billiardtable but gentlemen cannot always be within doors and       in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk       to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a       temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day
they called at various times of the morning sometimes       separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by       their aunt
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam       came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which       of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded       by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his       evident admiration of her of her former favourite george       wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less       captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she       believed he might have the best informed mind
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more       difficult to understand
it could not be for society as he       frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his       lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity       rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to       himself
he seldom appeared really animated
mrs collins knew       not what to make of him
colonel fitzwilliams occasionally       laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally       different which her own knowledge of him could not have told       her and as she would liked to have believed this change the       effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she       set herself seriously to work to find it out
she watched him       whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford       but without much success
he certainly looked at her friend a       great deal but the expression of that look was disputable
it       was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether       there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing       but absence of mind
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of       his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the       idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the       subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only       end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a       doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could       suppose him to be in her power
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her       marrying colonel fitzwilliam
he was beyond comparison the most       pleasant man he certainly admired her and his situation in life       was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr       darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin       could have none at all
chapter         more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park       unexpectedly meet mr darcy
she felt all the perverseness of the       mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought       and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him       at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers
how it could       occur a second time therefore was very odd
yet it did and       even a third
it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary       penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal       enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually       thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her
he never       said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of       talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of       their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected       questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of       solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss       happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly       understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she       came into kent again she would be staying there too
his words       seemed to imply it
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his       thoughts
she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an       allusion to what might arise in that quarter
it distressed her a       little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the       pales opposite the parsonage
she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last       letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had       not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by       mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was       meeting her
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a       smile she said        i did not know before that you ever walked this way        i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i       generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at       the parsonage
are you going much farther        no i should have turned in a moment        and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the       parsonage together
do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she
yesif darcy does not put it off again
but i am at his       disposal
he arranges the business just as he pleases        and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at       least pleasure in the great power of choice
i do not know       anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes       than mr darcy        he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel       fitzwilliam
but so we all do
it is only that he has better       means of having it than many others because he is rich and many       others are poor
i speak feelingly
a younger son you know must       be inured to selfdenial and dependence        in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little       of either
now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial       and dependence
when have you been prevented by want of money       from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a       fancy for        these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have       experienced many hardships of that nature
but in matters of       greater weight i may suffer from want of money
younger sons       cannot marry where they like        unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very       often do        our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not       many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some       attention to money        is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at       the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and       pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son
unless       the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask       above fifty thousand pounds        he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped
to       interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with       what had passed she soon afterwards said        i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the       sake of having someone at his disposal
i wonder he does not       marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind
but       perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is       under his sole care he may do what he likes with her        no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he       must divide with me
i am joined with him in the guardianship of       miss darcy        are you indeed
and pray what sort of guardians do you make
does your charge give you much trouble
young ladies of her age       are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the       true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way        as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the       manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss       darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she       had somehow or other got pretty near the truth
she directly       replied        you need not be frightened
i never heard any harm of her and i       dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my       acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley
i think i have heard       you say that you know them        i know them a little
their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike       manhe is a great friend of darcys        oh
yes said elizabeth drily mr
darcy is uncommonly kind to       mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him        care of him
yes i really believe darcy does take care of him       in those points where he most wants care
from something that he       told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley       very much indebted to him
but i ought to beg his pardon for i       have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant
it       was all conjecture        what is it you mean        it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally       known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it       would be an unpleasant thing        you may depend upon my not mentioning it        and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be       bingley
what he told me was merely this that he congratulated       himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences       of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any       other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from       believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that       sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of       last summer        did mr darcy give you reasons for this interference        i understood that there were some very strong objections against       the lady        and what arts did he use to separate them        he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam       smiling
he only told me what i have now told you        elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with       indignation
after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her       why she was so thoughtful
i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she
your       cousins conduct does not suit my feelings
why was he to be the       judge        you are rather disposed to call his interference officious        i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety       of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgement       alone he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend       was to be happy
but she continued recollecting herself as       we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the       case        that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is       a lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly        this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a       picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an       answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked       on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage
there       shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she       could think without interruption of all that she had heard
it       was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than       those with whom she was connected
there could not exist in the       world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless       influence
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to       separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had       always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and       arrangement of them
if his own vanity however did not mislead       him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of       all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer
he had       ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most       affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say       how lasting an evil he might have inflicted
there were some very strong objections against the lady were       colonel fitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably       were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and       another who was in business in london
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility       of objection all loveliness and goodness as she isher       understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners       captivating
neither could anything be urged against my father       who though with some peculiarities has abilities mr darcy       himself need not disdain and respectability which he will       probably never reach when she thought of her mother her       confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any       objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose       pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the       want of importance in his friends connections than from their       want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had       been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by       the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on       a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that       added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her       not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to       drink tea
mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did       not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband       from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his       apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her       staying at home
chapter         when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate       herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her       employment the examination of all the letters which jane had       written to her since her being in kent
they contained no actual       complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any       communication of present suffering
but in all and in almost       every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which       had been used to characterise her style and which proceeding       from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly       disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of       uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the       first perusal
mr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had       been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters       sufferings
it was some consolation to think that his visit to       rosings was to end on the day after the nextand a still       greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with       jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her       spirits by all that affection could do
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering       that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had       made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as       he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound       of the doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the       idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once       before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire       particularly after her
but this idea was soon banished and her       spirits were very differently affected when to her utter       amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room
in an hurried       manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing       his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better
she answered       him with cold civility
he sat down for a few moments and then       getting up walked about the room
elizabeth was surprised but       said not a word
after a silence of several minutes he came       towards her in an agitated manner and thus began        in vain i have struggled
it will not do
my feelings will not       be repressed
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire       and love you        elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression
she stared       coloured doubted and was silent
this he considered sufficient       encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long       felt for her immediately followed
he spoke well but there were       feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was       not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride
his       sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family       obstacles which had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on       with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was       wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit
in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be       insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and       though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at       first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to       resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in       anger
she tried however to compose herself to answer him with       patience when he should have done
he concluded with       representing to her the strength of that attachment which in       spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer       and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her       acceptance of his hand
as he said this she could easily see       that he had no doubt of a favourable answer
he spoke of       apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real       security
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and       when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said        in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to       express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however       unequally they may be returned
it is natural that obligation       should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now       thank you
but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion       and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly
i am sorry       to have occasioned pain to anyone
it has been most unconsciously       done however and i hope will be of short duration
the feelings       which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of       your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after       this explanation        mr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes       fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less       resentment than surprise
his complexion became pale with anger       and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature
he       was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not       open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it
the       pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful
at length with a       voice of forced calmness he said        and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of       expecting
i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so       little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected
but it is of       small importance        i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a       desire of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that       you liked me against your will against your reason and even       against your character
was not this some excuse for incivility       if i was uncivil
but i have other provocations
you know i       have
had not my feelings decided against youhad they been       indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that       any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been       the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most       beloved sister        as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the       emotion was short and he listened without attempting to       interrupt her while she continued        i have every reason in the world to think ill of you
no motive       can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there
you       dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if       not the only means of dividing them from each otherof exposing       one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability and       the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving       them both in misery of the acutest kind        she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was       listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any       feeling of remorse
he even looked at her with a smile of       affected incredulity
can you deny that you have done it she repeated
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of       denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend       from your sister or that i rejoice in my success
towards him       i have been kinder than towards myself        elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil       reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to       conciliate her
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my       dislike is founded
long before it had taken place my opinion of       you was decided
your character was unfolded in the recital which       i received many months ago from mr wickham
on this subject       what can you have to say
in what imaginary act of friendship can       you here defend yourself
or under what misrepresentation can you       here impose upon others        you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said       darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour
who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling       an interest in him        his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his       misfortunes have been great indeed        and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy
you have       reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty
you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been       designed for him
you have deprived the best years of his life of       that independence which was no less his due than his desert
you       have done all this
and yet you can treat the mention of his       misfortune with contempt and ridicule        and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the       room is your opinion of me
this is the estimation in which you       hold me
i thank you for explaining it so fully
my faults       according to this calculation are heavy indeed
but perhaps       added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these       offenses might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt       by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented       my forming any serious design
these bitter accusations might       have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my       struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled       by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection       by everything
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence
nor       am i ashamed of the feelings i related
they were natural and       just
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your       connectionsto congratulate myself on the hope of relations       whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own        elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she       tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said        you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of       your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared       me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you       behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner        she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she       continued        you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible       way that would have tempted me to accept it        again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an       expression of mingled incredulity and mortification
she went on        from the very beginningfrom the first moment i may almost       sayof my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with       the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your       selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form       the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have       built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month       before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i       could ever be prevailed on to marry        you have said quite enough madam
i perfectly comprehend your       feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have       been
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and       accept my best wishes for your health and happiness        and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth       heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great
she knew not how       to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried       for halfanhour
her astonishment as she reflected on what had       passed was increased by every review of it
that she should       receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy
that he should have       been in love with her for so many months
so much in love as to       wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made       him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must       appear at least with equal force in his own casewas almost       incredible
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so       strong an affection
but his pride his abominable pridehis       shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to janehis       unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not       justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned       mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to       deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his       attachment had for a moment excited
she continued in very       agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage       made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes       observation and hurried her away to her room
chapter         elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and       meditations which had at length closed her eyes
she could not       yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was       impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for       employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge       herself in air and exercise
she was proceeding directly to her       favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys sometimes       coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she       turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroad
the       park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon       passed one of the gates into the ground
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she       was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the       gates and look into the park
the five weeks which she had now       passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and       every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees
she was       on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of       a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was       moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was       directly retreating
but the person who advanced was now near       enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness       pronounced her name
she had turned away but on hearing herself       called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she       moved again towards the gate
he had by that time reached it       also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took       said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in       the grove some time in the hope of meeting you
will you do me       the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow       turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest       curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still       increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of       letterpaper written quite through in a very close hand
the       envelope itself was likewise full
pursuing her way along the       lane she then began it
it was dated from rosings at eight       oclock in the morning and was as follows        be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the       apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments       or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to       you
i write without any intention of paining you or humbling       myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both       cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation       and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been       spared had not my character required it to be written and read
you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your       attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but       i demand it of your justice
two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of       equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge
the first       mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i       had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i       had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and       humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the       prospects of mr wickham
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown       off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my       father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on       our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its       exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two       young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few       weeks could bear no comparison
but from the severity of that       blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each       circumstance i shall hope to be in the future secured when the       following account of my actions and their motives has been read
if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am       under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive       to yours i can only say that i am sorry
the necessity must be       obeyed and further apology would be absurd
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common       with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any       other young woman in the country
but it was not till the evening       of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his       feeling a serious attachment
i had often seen him in love       before
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you       i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental       information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given       rise to a general expectation of their marriage
he spoke of it       as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided
from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively       and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was       beyond what i had ever witnessed in him
your sister i also       watched
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging       as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i       remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she       received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by       any participation of sentiment
if you have not been mistaken       here i must have been in error
your superior knowledge of       your sister must make the latter probable
if it be so if i have       been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment       has not been unreasonable
but i shall not scruple to assert       that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such       as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that       however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily       touched
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is       certainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and       decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears
i did       not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed       it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason
my       objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last       night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion       to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be       so great an evil to my friend as to me
but there were other       causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and       existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself       endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before       me
these causes must be stated though briefly
the situation of       your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in       comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently so       almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger       sisters and occasionally even by your father
pardon me
it       pains me to offend you
but amidst your concern for the defects       of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this       representation of them let it give you consolation to consider       that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of       the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and       your elder sister than it is honourable to the sense and       disposition of both
i will only say farther that from what       passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and       every inducement heightened which could have led me before to       preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy       connection
he left netherfield for london on the day following       as you i am certain remember with the design of soon       returning
the part which i acted is now to be explained
his sisters       uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence       of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time       was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on       joining him directly in london
we accordingly wentand there i       readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the       certain evils of such a choice
i described and enforced them       earnestly
but however this remonstrance might have staggered or       delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would       ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded       by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your sisters       indifference
he had before believed her to return his affection       with sincere if not with equal regard
but bingley has great       natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than       on his own
to convince him therefore that he had deceived       himself was no very difficult point
to persuade him against       returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been       given was scarcely the work of a moment
i cannot blame myself       for having done thus much
there is but one part of my conduct in       the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it       is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to       conceal from him your sisters being in town
i knew it myself       as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet       ignorant of it
that they might have met without ill consequence       is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough       extinguished for him to see her without some danger
perhaps this       concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however       and it was done for the best
on this subject i have nothing more       to say no other apology to offer
if i have wounded your       sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives       which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient       i have not yet learnt to condemn them
with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having       injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you       the whole of his connection with my family
of what he has       particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what       i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted       veracity
mr
wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for       many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose       good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my       father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was       his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed
my       father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridgemost       important assistance as his own father always poor from the       extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a       gentlemans education
my father was not only fond of this young       mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also       the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his       profession intended to provide for him in it
as for myself it       is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very       different manner
the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle       which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best       friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly       the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing       him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have
here       again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell
but       whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a       suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his       real characterit adds even another motive
my excellent father died about five years ago and his       attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his       will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his       advancement in the best manner that his profession might       allowand if he took orders desired that a valuable family       living might be his as soon as it became vacant
there was also a       legacy of one thousand pounds
his own father did not long       survive mine and within half a year from these events mr       wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against       taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for       him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of       the preferment by which he could not be benefited
he had some       intention he added of studying law and i must be aware that       the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient       support therein
i rather wished than believed him to be       sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his       proposal
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman       the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to       assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be       in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three       thousand pounds
all connection between us seemed now dissolved
i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his       society in town
in town i believe he chiefly lived but his       studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all       restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation
for       about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of       the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he       applied to me again by letter for the presentation
his       circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in       believing it were exceedingly bad
he had found the law a most       unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being       ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof       which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well       assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could       not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions
you will       hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for       resisting every repetition to it
his resentment was in       proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was       doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his       reproaches to myself
after this period every appearance of       acquaintance was dropped
how he lived i know not
but last       summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget       myself and which no obligation less than the present should       induce me to unfold to any human being
having said thus much i       feel no doubt of your secrecy
my sister who is more than ten       years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers       nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself
about a year ago she       was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in       london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over       it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly       by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance       between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most       unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far       recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart       retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child       that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent       to an elopement
she was then but fifteen which must be her       excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that       i owed the knowledge of it to herself
i joined them unexpectedly       a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana       unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother       whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole       to me
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted
regard for my       sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i       wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs       younge was of course removed from her charge
mr wickhams chief       object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty       thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of       revenging himself on me was a strong inducement
his revenge       would have been complete indeed
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we       have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject       it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty       towards mr wickham
i know not in what manner under what form       of falsehood he had imposed on you but his success is not       perhaps to be wondered at
ignorant as you previously were of       everything concerning either detection could not be in your       power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last       night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what       could or ought to be revealed
for the truth of everything here       related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of       colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant       intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers       will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of       these transactions
if your abhorrence of me should make my       assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause       from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the       possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some       opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of       the morning
i will only add god bless you
fitzwilliam darcy     chapter         if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect       it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no       expectation at all of its contents
but such as they were it may       well be supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a       contrariety of emotion they excited
her feelings as she read       were scarcely to be defined
with amazement did she first       understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and       steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation       to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal
with a       strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his       account of what had happened at netherfield
she read with an       eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from       impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was       incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes
his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved       to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to       the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him       justice
he expressed no regret for what he had done which       satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty
it was       all pride and insolence
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr       wickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation       of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion       of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own       history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and       more difficult of definition
astonishment apprehension and       even horror oppressed her
she wished to discredit it entirely       repeatedly exclaiming this must be false
this cannot be
this       must be the grossest falsehoodand when she had gone through       the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last       page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not       regard it that she would never look in it again
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on       nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the       letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she       could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related       to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the       meaning of every sentence
the account of his connection with the       pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the       kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known       its extent agreed equally well with his own words
so far each       recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the       difference was great
what wickham had said of the living was       fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was       impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side       or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that       her wishes did not err
but when she read and reread with the       closest attention the particulars immediately following of       wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his       receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds       again was she forced to hesitate
she put down the letter       weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be       impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut       with little success
on both sides it was only assertion
again       she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair       which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could       so represent as to render mr darcys conduct in it less than       infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely       blameless throughout the whole
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to       lay at mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more       so as she could bring no proof of its injustice
she had never       heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in       which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on       meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight       acquaintance
of his former way of life nothing had been known in       hertfordshire but what he told himself
as to his real character       had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of       enquiring
his countenance voice and manner had established him       at once in the possession of every virtue
she tried to recollect       some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity       or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr       darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for       those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what       mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years       continuance
but no such recollection befriended her
she could       see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address       but she could remember no more substantial good than the general       approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social       powers had gained him in the mess
after pausing on this point a       considerable while she once more continued to read
but alas
the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received       some confirmation from what had passed between colonel       fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she       was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel       fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the       information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and       whose character she had no reason to question
at one time she       had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked       by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly       banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have       hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his       cousins corroboration
she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in       conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening       at mr phillipss
many of his expressions were still fresh in       her memory
she was now struck with the impropriety of such       communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her       before
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he       had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his       conduct
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of       seeing mr darcythat mr darcy might leave the country but that       he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield       ball the very next week
she remembered also that till the       netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story       to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been       everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples       in sinking mr darcys character though he had assured her that       respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son
how differently did everything now appear in which he was       concerned
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence       of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of       her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but       his eagerness to grasp at anything
his behaviour to herself       could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been       deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his       vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had       most incautiously shown
every lingering struggle in his favour       grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr       darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned       by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair       that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in       the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had       latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of       intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be       unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or       immoral habits that among his own connections he was esteemed       and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother       and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his       sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had       his actions been what mr wickham represented them so gross a       violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed       from the world and that friendship between a person capable of       it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself
of neither darcy nor       wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind       partial prejudiced absurd
how despicably i have acted she cried i who have prided       myself on my discernment
i who have valued myself on my       abilities
who have often disdained the generous candour of my       sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust
how humiliating is this discovery
yet how just a humiliation
had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind
but vanity not love has been my folly
pleased with the       preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on       the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted       prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either       were concerned
till this moment i never knew myself        from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a       line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys       explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read       it again
widely different was the effect of a second perusal
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance       which she had been obliged to give in the other
he declared       himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment       and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had       always been
neither could she deny the justice of his       description of jane
she felt that janes feelings though       fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant       complacency in her air and manner not often united with great       sensibility
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were       mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her       sense of shame was severe
the justice of the charge struck her       too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he       particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball       and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have       made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt
it       soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had       thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she       considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work       of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit       of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt       depressed beyond anything she had ever known before
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every       variety of thoughtreconsidering events determining       probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to       a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection       of her long absence made her at length return home and she       entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual       and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make       her unfit for conversation
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had       each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few       minutes to take leavebut that colonel fitzwilliam had been       sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and       almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she       really rejoiced at it
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an       object she could think only of her letter
chapter         the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins       having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting       obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of       their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits       as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone       through at rosings
to rosings he then hastened to console lady       catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with       great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that       she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having       them all to dine with her
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that       had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to       her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of       what her ladyships indignation would have been
what would she       have said
how would she have behaved were questions with which       she amused herself
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party
i       assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i       believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do
but i       am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be       so much attached to me
they were excessively sorry to go
but so       they always are
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably       till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely       more i think than last year
his attachment to rosings       certainly increases        mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here       which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed       out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by       supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she       added        but if that is the case you must write to your mother and beg       that you may stay a little longer
mrs collins will be very glad       of your company i am sure        i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation       replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it
i       must be in town next saturday        why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks
i       expected you to stay two months
i told mrs collins so before       you came
there can be no occasion for your going so soon
mrs       bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight        but my father cannot
he wrote last week to hurry my return        oh
your father of course may spare you if your mother can
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father
and if       you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to       take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in       june for a week and as dawson does not object to the       barouchebox there will be very good room for one of youand       indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not       object to taking you both as you are neither of you large        you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our       original plan        lady catherine seemed resigned
mrs
collins you must send a       servant with them
you know i always speak my mind and i cannot       bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves
it is highly improper
you must contrive to send somebody
i have       the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing
young       women should always be properly guarded and attended according       to their situation in life
when my niece georgiana went to       ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two       menservants go with her
miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy       of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with       propriety in a different manner
i am excessively attentive to       all those things
you must send john with the young ladies mrs       collins
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would       really be discreditable to you to let them go alone        my uncle is to send a servant for us        oh
your uncle
he keeps a manservant does he
i am very glad       you have somebody who thinks of these things
where shall you       change horses
oh
bromley of course
if you mention my name at       the bell you will be attended to        lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their       journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention       was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or       with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was       alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day       went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in       all the delight of unpleasant recollections
mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by       heart
she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its       writer were at times widely different
when she remembered the       style of his address she was still full of indignation but when       she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him       her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed       feelings became the object of compassion
his attachment excited       gratitude his general character respect but she could not       approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or       feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again
in her own       past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and       regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of       yet heavier chagrin
they were hopeless of remedy
her father       contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to       restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her       mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely       insensible of the evil
elizabeth had frequently united with jane       in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia       but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what       chance could there be of improvement
catherine weakspirited       irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always       affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless       would scarcely give them a hearing
they were ignorant idle and       vain
while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt       with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they       would be going there forever
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr       darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good       opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost
his       affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct       cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness       of his confidence in his friend
how grievous then was the       thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so       replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been       deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family
when to these recollections was added the development of       wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy       spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much       affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear       tolerably cheerful
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last       week of her stay as they had been at first
the very last evening       was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into       the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the       best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of       placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself       obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and       pack her trunk afresh
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension       wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford       again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to       curtsey and hold out her hand to both
chapter         on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a       few minutes before the others appeared and he took the       opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed       indispensably necessary
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has       yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i       am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving       her thanks for it
the favour of your company has been much felt       i assure you
we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our       humble abode
our plain manner of living our small rooms and few       domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford       extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will       believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done       everything in our power to prevent your spending your time       unpleasantly        elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of       being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received       must make her feel the obliged
mr collins was gratified and       with a more smiling solemnity replied        it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your       time not disagreeably
we have certainly done our best and most       fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very       superior society and from our connection with rosings the       frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may       flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been       entirely irksome
our situation with regard to lady catherines       family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing       which few can boast
you see on what a footing we are
you see       how continually we are engaged there
in truth i must acknowledge       that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i       should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion       while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings        words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he       was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to       unite civility and truth in a few short sentences
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into       hertfordshire my dear cousin
i flatter myself at least that you       will be able to do so
lady catherines great attentions to mrs       collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust       it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut       on this point it will be as well to be silent
only let me assure       you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most       cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage
my dear charlotte       and i have but one mind and one way of thinking
there is in       everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas       between us
we seem to have been designed for each other        elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where       that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she       firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts
she was       not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by       the lady from whom they sprang
poor charlotte
it was melancholy       to leave her to such society
but she had chosen it with her eyes       open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to       go she did not seem to ask for compassion
her home and her       housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent       concerns had not yet lost their charms
at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the       parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready
after       an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was       attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down       the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all       her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had       received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr       and mrs gardiner though unknown
he then handed her in maria       followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he       suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had       hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at       rosings
but he added you will of course wish to have your humble       respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their       kindness to you while you have been here        elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be       shut and the carriage drove off
good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it       seems but a day or two since we first came
and yet how many       things have happened        a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh
we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there       twice
how much i shall have to tell        elizabeth added privately and how much i shall have to       conceal        their journey was performed without much conversation or any       alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they       reached mr gardiners house where they were to remain a few       days
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of       studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the       kindness of her aunt had reserved for them
but jane was to go       home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for       observation
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even       for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys       proposals
to know that she had the power of revealing what would       so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so       highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been       able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing       could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she       remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her       fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into       repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister       further
chapter         it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies       set out together from gracechurch street for the town of  in       hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr       bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in       token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking       out of a diningroom up stairs
these two girls had been above an       hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite       milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a salad       and cucumber
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a       table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually       affords exclaiming is not this nice
is not this an agreeable       surprise        and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend       us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there       then showing her purchaseslook here i have bought this       bonnet
i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might       as well buy it as not
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get       home and see if i can make it up any better        and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect       unconcern oh
but there were two or three much uglier in the       shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim       it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable
besides it       will not much signify what one wears this summer after the       shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight        are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest       satisfaction
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want       papa to take us all there for the summer
it would be such a       delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost anything at       all
mamma would like to go too of all things
only think what a       miserable summer else we shall have        yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme       indeed and completely do for us at once
good heaven
brighton       and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset       already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of       meryton        now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down       at table
what do you think
it is excellent newscapital       newsand about a certain person we all like        jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told       he need not stay
lydia laughed and said        aye that is just like your formality and discretion
you       thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared
i dare say he       often hears worse things said than i am going to say
but he is       an ugly fellow
i am glad he is gone
i never saw such a long       chin in my life
well but now for my news it is about dear       wickham too good for the waiter is it not
there is no danger       of wickhams marrying mary king
theres for you
she is gone       down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay
wickham is safe        and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection       imprudent as to fortune        she is a great fool for going away if she liked him        but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said       jane
i am sure there is not on his
i will answer for it he never       cared three straws about herwho could about such a nasty       little freckled thing        elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such       coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the       sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured       and fancied liberal
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was       ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all       their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition       of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it
how nicely we are all crammed in cried lydia
i am glad i       bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another       bandbox
well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk       and laugh all the way home
and in the first place let us hear       what has happened to you all since you went away
have you seen       any pleasant men
have you had any flirting
i was in great hopes       that one of you would have got a husband before you came back
jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare
she is almost       threeandtwenty
lord how ashamed i should be of not being       married before threeandtwenty
my aunt phillips wants you so to       get husbands you cant think
she says lizzy had better have       taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any       fun in it
lord
how i should like to be married before any of       you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls
dear       me
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel       forsters
kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs       forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the       bye mrs forster and me are such friends
and so she asked       the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was       forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did
we       dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for       a lady only think what fun
not a soul knew of it but colonel       and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were       forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how       well he looked
when denny and wickham and pratt and two or       three more of the men came in they did not know him in the       least
lord
how i laughed
and so did mrs forster
i thought i       should have died
and that made the men suspect something and       then they soon found out what was the matter        with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did       lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to       amuse her companions all the way to longbourn
elizabeth listened       as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent       mention of wickhams name
their reception at home was most kind
mrs bennet rejoiced to       see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner       did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth        i am glad you are come back lizzy        their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the       lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were       the subjects that occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of       maria after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs       bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of       the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and       on the other retailing them all to the younger lucases and       lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was       enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who       would hear her
oh
mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had       such fun
as we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and       pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone       so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to       the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated       the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and       if you would have gone we would have treated you too
and then       when we came away it was such fun
i thought we never should have       got into the coach
i was ready to die of laughter
and then we       were so merry all the way home
we talked and laughed so loud       that anybody might have heard us ten miles off        to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear       sister to depreciate such pleasures
they would doubtless be       congenial with the generality of female minds
but i confess they       would have no charms for mei should infinitely prefer a book        but of this answer lydia heard not a word
she seldom listened to       anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary       at all
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to       walk to meryton and to see how everybody went on but elizabeth       steadily opposed the scheme
it should not be said that the miss       bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in       pursuit of the officers
there was another reason too for her       opposition
she dreaded seeing mr wickham again and was       resolved to avoid it as long as possible
the comfort to her of       the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression
in a fortnight they were to goand once gone she hoped there       could be nothing more to plague her on his account
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the       brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn       was under frequent discussion between her parents
elizabeth saw       directly that her father had not the smallest intention of       yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and       equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never       yet despaired of succeeding at last
chapter         elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened       could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress       every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing       her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the       chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong       sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear       perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other       feelings
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his       sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but       still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters       refusal must have given him
his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and       certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it       must increase his disappointment        indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he       has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his       regard for me
you do not blame me however for refusing him        blame you
oh no        but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham        noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did        but you will know it when i tell you what happened the very       next day        she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents       as far as they concerned george wickham
what a stroke was this       for poor jane
who would willingly have gone through the world       without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole       race of mankind as was here collected in one individual
nor was       darcys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of       consoling her for such discovery
most earnestly did she labour       to prove the probability of error and seek to clear the one       without involving the other
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to       make both of them good for anything
take your choice but you       must be satisfied with only one
there is but such a quantity of       merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and       of late it has been shifting about pretty much
for my part i am       inclined to believe it all darcys but you shall do as you       choose        it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from       jane
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she
wickham       so very bad
it is almost past belief
and poor mr darcy
dear       lizzy only consider what he must have suffered
such a       disappointment
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too
and having to relate such a thing of his sister
it is really too       distressing
i am sure you must feel it so        oh
no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you       so full of both
i know you will do him such ample justice that       i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent
your       profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much       longer my heart will be as light as a feather        poor wickham
there is such an expression of goodness in his       countenance
such an openness and gentleness in his manner        there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of       those two young men
one has got all the goodness and the other       all the appearance of it        i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it       as you used to do        and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a       dislike to him without any reason
it is such a spur to ones       genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind
one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but       one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then       stumbling on something witty        lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not       treat the matter as you do now        indeed i could not
i was uncomfortable enough i may say       unhappy
and with no one to speak to about what i felt no jane       to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain       and nonsensical as i knew i had
oh
how i wanted you        how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong       expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they       do appear wholly undeserved        certainly
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a       most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been       encouraging
there is one point on which i want your advice
i       want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our       acquaintances in general understand wickhams character        miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can       be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully
what is your       opinion        that it ought not to be attempted
mr darcy has not authorised       me to make his communication public
on the contrary every       particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as       possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to       the rest of his conduct who will believe me
the general       prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the       death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him       in an amiable light
i am not equal to it
wickham will soon be       gone and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he       really is
some time hence it will be all found out and then we       may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before
at present       i will say nothing about it        you are quite right
to have his errors made public might ruin       him for ever
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and       anxious to reestablish a character
we must not make him       desperate        the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her       for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane       whenever she might wish to talk again of either
but there was       still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the       disclosure
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys       letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been       valued by her friend
here was knowledge in which no one could       partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect       understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing       off this last encumbrance of mystery
and then said she if       that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely       be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable       manner himself
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till       it has lost all its value        she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the       real state of her sisters spirits
jane was not happy
she still       cherished a very tender affection for bingley
having never even       fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of       first attachment and from her age and disposition greater       steadiness than most first attachments often boast and so       fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every       other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the       feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence       of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health       and their tranquillity
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion       now of this sad business of janes
for my part i am       determined never to speak of it again to anybody
i told my       sister phillips so the other day
but i cannot find out that jane       saw anything of him in london
well he is a very undeserving       young manand i do not suppose theres the least chance in the       world of her ever getting him now
there is no talk of his coming       to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of       everybody too who is likely to know        i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more        oh well
it is just as he chooses
nobody wants him to come
though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and       if i was her i would not have put up with it
well my comfort       is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will       be sorry for what he has done        but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such       expectation she made no answer
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the       collinses live very comfortable do they
well well i only hope       it will last
and what sort of table do they keep
charlotte is       an excellent manager i dare say
if she is half as sharp as her       mother she is saving enough
there is nothing extravagant in       their housekeeping i dare say        no nothing at all        a great deal of good management depend upon it
yes yes
they will take care not to outrun their income
they will       never be distressed for money
well much good may it do them
and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your       father is dead
they look upon it as quite their own i dare say       whenever that happens        it was a subject which they could not mention before me        no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt       they often talk of it between themselves
well if they can be       easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the       better
i should be ashamed of having one that was only       entailed on me     chapter         the first week of their return was soon gone
the second began
it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the       young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace
the       dejection was almost universal
the elder miss bennets alone were       still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course       of their employments
very frequently were they reproached for       this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was       extreme and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in       any of the family
good heaven
what is to become of us
what are we to do would       they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe
how can you be       smiling so lizzy        their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered       what she had herself endured on a similar occasion       fiveandtwenty years ago
i am sure said she i cried for two days together when       colonel millers regiment went away
i thought i should have       broken my heart        i am sure i shall break mine said lydia
if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet
oh yesif one could but go to brighton
but papa is so       disagreeable        a little seabathing would set me up forever        and my aunt phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of       good added kitty
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through       longbourn house
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all       sense of pleasure was lost in shame
she felt anew the justice of       mr darcys objections and never had she been so much disposed       to pardon his interference in the views of his friend
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for       she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the       colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton
this       invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately       married
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had       recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three       months acquaintance they had been intimate two
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs       forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of       kitty are scarcely to be described
wholly inattentive to her       sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless       ecstasy calling for everyones congratulations and laughing and       talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty       continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as       unreasonable as her accent was peevish
i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as       lydia said she though i am not her particular friend
i       have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for       i am two years older        in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to       make her resigned
as for elizabeth herself this invitation was       so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother       and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all       possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as       such a step must make her were it known she could not help       secretly advising her father not to let her go
she represented       to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the       little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a       woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more       imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the       temptations must be greater than at home
he heard her       attentively and then said        lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some       public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with       so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the       present circumstances        if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great       disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of       lydias unguarded and imprudent mannernay which has already       arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the       affair        already arisen repeated mr bennet
what has she frightened       away some of your lovers
poor little lizzy
but do not be cast       down
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a       little absurdity are not worth a regret
come let me see the       list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias       folly        indeed you are mistaken
i have no such injuries to resent
it       is not of particular but of general evils which i am now       complaining
our importance our respectability in the world must       be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of       all restraint which mark lydias character
excuse me for i must       speak plainly
if you my dear father will not take the trouble       of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her       present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will       soon be beyond the reach of amendment
her character will be       fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt       that ever made herself or her family ridiculous a flirt too in       the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any       attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the       ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off       any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for       admiration will excite
in this danger kitty also is       comprehended
she will follow wherever lydia leads
vain       ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled
oh
my dear father       can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and       despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not       be often involved in the disgrace        mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and       affectionately taking her hand said in reply        do not make yourself uneasy my love
wherever you and jane are       known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear       to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say threevery       silly sisters
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does       not go to brighton
let her go then
colonel forster is a       sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she       is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody
at       brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt       than she has been here
the officers will find women better worth       their notice
let us hope therefore that her being there may       teach her her own insignificance
at any rate she cannot grow       many degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the       rest of her life        with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own       opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and       sorry
it was not in her nature however to increase her       vexations by dwelling on them
she was confident of having       performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or       augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference       with her father their indignation would hardly have found       expression in their united volubility
in lydias imagination a       visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly       happiness
she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets       of that gay bathingplace covered with officers
she saw herself       the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present       unknown
she saw all the glories of the campits tents stretched       forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young       and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the       view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting       with at least six officers at once
had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects       and such realities as these what would have been her sensations
they could have been understood only by her mother who might       have felt nearly the same
lydias going to brighton was all that       consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husbands never       intending to go there himself
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their       raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of       lydias leaving home
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time
having       been frequently in company with him since her return agitation       was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality       entirely so
she had even learnt to detect in the very       gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a       sameness to disgust and weary
in his present behaviour to       herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the       inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which       had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve       after what had since passed to provoke her
she lost all concern       for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such       idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed       it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing       that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had       been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference       secured at any time by their renewal
on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton he       dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little       was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on       his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had       passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr       darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him       if he was acquainted with the former
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments       recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly       seen him often and after observing that he was a very       gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him
her answer       was warmly in his favour
with an air of indifference he soon       afterwards added        how long did you say he was at rosings        nearly three weeks        and you saw him frequently        yes almost every day        his manners are very different from his cousins        yes very different
but i think mr darcy improves upon       acquaintance        indeed cried mr wickham with a look which did not escape her
and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a       gayer tone is it in address that he improves
has he deigned to       add aught of civility to his ordinary stylefor i dare not       hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is       improved in essentials        oh no said elizabeth
in essentials i believe he is very       much what he ever was        while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to       rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning
there was a       something in her countenance which made him listen with an       apprehensive and anxious attention while she added        when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean       that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement but       that from knowing him better his disposition was better       understood        wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and       agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off       his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the       gentlest of accents        you who so well know my feeling towards mr darcy will readily       comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to       assume even the appearance of what is right
his pride in that       direction may be of service if not to himself to many others       for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have       suffered by
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which       you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his       visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgement he stands       much in awe
his fear of her has always operated i know when       they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish       of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain       he has very much at heart        elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered       only by a slight inclination of the head
she saw that he wanted       to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was       in no humour to indulge him
the rest of the evening passed with       the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no       further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last       with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never       meeting again
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to       meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than       pathetic
kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep       from vexation and envy
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good       wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her       injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying       herself as much as possibleadvice which there was every reason       to believe would be well attended to and in the clamorous       happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle       adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard
chapter         had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she       could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal       felicity or domestic comfort
her father captivated by youth and       beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty       generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and       illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all       real affection for her
respect esteem and confidence had       vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were       overthrown
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek       comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had       brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the       unfortunate for their folly or their vice
he was fond of the       country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his       principal enjoyments
to his wife he was very little otherwise       indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his       amusement
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in       general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of       entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive       benefit from such as are given
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of       her fathers behaviour as a husband
she had always seen it with       pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his       affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what       she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that       continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in       exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so       highly reprehensible
but she had never felt so strongly as now       the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable       a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising       from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which       rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of       his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his       wife
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found       little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment
their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home       she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the       dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their       domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her       natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were       removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil       might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly       and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a       wateringplace and a camp
upon the whole therefore she found       what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she       had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking       place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself
it       was consequently necessary to name some other period for the       commencement of actual felicityto have some other point on which       her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the       pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and       prepare for another disappointment
her tour to the lakes was now       the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation       for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her       mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included       jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to       wish for
were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment       would be certain
but here by carrying with me one ceaseless       source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to       have all my expectations of pleasure realised
a scheme of which       every part promises delight can never be successful and general       disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little       peculiar vexation        when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very       minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always       long expected and always very short
those to her mother       contained little else than that they were just returned from the       library where such and such officers had attended them and       where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite       wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would       have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a       violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going       off to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister       there was still less to be learntfor her letters to kitty       though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words       to be made public
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health       good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn
everything wore a happier aspect
the families who had been in       town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer       engagements arose
mrs bennet was restored to her usual       querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much       recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event       of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the       following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not       to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and       malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should       be quartered in meryton
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now       fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a       letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its       commencement and curtailed its extent
mr gardiner would be       prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in       july and must be in london again within a month and as that       left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as       they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and       comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the       lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to       the present plan were to go no farther northwards than       derbyshire
in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy       the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a       peculiarly strong attraction
the town where she had formerly       passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a       few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all       the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the       peak
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on       seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time       enough
but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her       temper to be happy and all was soon right again
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of       pemberley and its owner
but surely said she i may enter his       county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without       his perceiving me        the period of expectation was now doubled
four weeks were to       pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival
but they did pass       away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at       length appear at longbourn
the children two girls of six and       eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the       particular care of their cousin jane who was the general       favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly       adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them       playing with them and loving them
the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the       next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement
one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions a       suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear       inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand       affection and intelligence which might supply it among       themselves if there were disappointments abroad
it is not the object of this work to give a description of       derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which       their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth       birmingham etc
are sufficiently known
a small part of       derbyshire is all the present concern
to the little town of       lambton the scene of mrs gardiners former residence and where       she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained they       bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of       the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found       from her aunt that pemberley was situated
it was not in their       direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it
in talking       over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an       inclination to see the place again
mr gardiner declared his       willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have       heard so much said her aunt a place too with which so many       of your acquaintances are connected
wickham passed all his youth       there you know        elizabeth was distressed
she felt that she had no business at       pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing       it
she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after       going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or       satin curtains
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity
if it were merely a fine       house richly furnished said she i should not care about it       myself but the grounds are delightful
they have some of the       finest woods in the country        elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce
the       possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place       instantly occurred
it would be dreadful
she blushed at the very       idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt       than to run such a risk
but against this there were objections       and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if       her private enquiries to the absence of the family were       unfavourably answered
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid       whether pemberley were not a very fine place
what was the name       of its proprietor
and with no little alarm whether the family       were down for the summer
a most welcome negative followed the       last questionand her alarms now being removed she was at       leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house       herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and       she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper       air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the       scheme
to pemberley therefore they were to go
chapter         elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance       of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length       they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground
they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some       time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and       admired every remarkable spot and point of view
they gradually       ascended for halfamile and then found themselves at the top of       a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was       instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite       side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound
it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising       ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front       a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but       without any artificial appearance
its banks were neither formal       nor falsely adorned
elizabeth was delighted
she had never seen       a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty       had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste
they were       all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt       that to be mistress of pemberley might be something
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the       door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all       her apprehension of meeting its owner returned
she dreaded lest       the chambermaid had been mistaken
on applying to see the place       they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited       for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she       was
the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much       less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding       her
they followed her into the diningparlour
it was a large       well proportioned room handsomely fitted up
elizabeth after       slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect
the hill crowned with wood which they had descended receiving       increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object
every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the       whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the       winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with       delight
as they passed into other rooms these objects were       taking different positions but from every window there were       beauties to be seen
the rooms were lofty and handsome and their       furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor but       elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither       gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendour and more real       elegance than the furniture of rosings
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress
with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted
instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in       them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and       aunt
but norecollecting herselfthat could never be my       uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been       allowed to invite them        this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very       like regret
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was       really absent but had not the courage for it
at length however       the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with       alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we       expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends how       rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any       circumstance been delayed a day
her aunt now called her to look at a picture
she approached and       saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other       miniatures over the mantelpiece
her aunt asked her smilingly       how she liked it
the housekeeper came forward and told them it       was a picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters       steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense
he       is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has       turned out very wild        mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth       could not return it
and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the       miniatures is my masterand very like him
it was drawn at the       same time as the otherabout eight years ago        i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs       gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face
but       lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not        mrs reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this       intimation of her knowing her master
does that young lady know mr darcy        elizabeth coloured and said a little        and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam        yes very handsome        i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up       stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this
this room was my late masters favourite room and these       miniatures are just as they used to be then
he was very fond of       them        this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickhams being among them
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy       drawn when she was only eight years old
and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mrs       gardiner
oh
yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so       accomplishedshe plays and sings all day long
in the next room       is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my       master she comes here tomorrow with him        mr gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant       encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks       mrs reynolds either by pride or attachment had evidently great       pleasure in talking of her master and his sister
is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year        not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend       half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer       months        except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate        if your master would marry you might see more of him        yes sir but i do not know when that will be
i do not know       who is good enough for him        mr and mrs gardiner smiled
elizabeth could not help saying       it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think       so        i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows       him replied the other
elizabeth thought this was going pretty       far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the       housekeeper added i have never known a cross word from him in       my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old        this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite       to her ideas
that he was not a goodtempered man had been her       firmest opinion
her keenest attention was awakened she longed       to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying        there are very few people of whom so much can be said
you are       lucky in having such a master        yes sir i know i am
if i were to go through the world i       could not meet with a better
but i have always observed that       they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when       they grow up and he was always the sweetesttempered most       generoushearted boy in the world        elizabeth almost stared at her
can this be mr darcy thought       she
his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner
yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like       himjust as affable to the poor        elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for       more
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point
she       related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the       rooms and the price of the furniture in vain
mr gardiner       highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he       attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led       again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many       merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that       ever lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of       nothing but themselves
there is not one of his tenants or       servants but will give him a good name
some people call him       proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it
to my fancy it       is only because he does not rattle away like other young men        in what an amiable light does this place him thought       elizabeth
this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked       is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend        perhaps we might be deceived        that is not very likely our authority was too good        on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very       pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and       lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it       was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a       liking to the room when last at pemberley
he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked       towards one of the windows
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should       enter the room
and this is always the way with him she added
whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in       a moment
there is nothing he would not do for her        the picturegallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms       were all that remained to be shown
in the former were many good       paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such       as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to       look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects       were usually more interesting and also more intelligible
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could       have little to fix the attention of a stranger
elizabeth walked       in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her
at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance to       mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to       have sometimes seen when he looked at her
she stood several       minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and       returned to it again before they quitted the gallery
mrs       reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers       lifetime
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more       gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at       the height of their acquaintance
the commendation bestowed on       him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature
what praise is       more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant
as a       brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples       happiness were in his guardianshiphow much of pleasure or pain       was it in his power to bestowhow much of good or evil must be       done by him
every idea that had been brought forward by the       housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood       before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes       upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment       of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its       warmth and softened its impropriety of expression
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had       been seen they returned downstairs and taking leave of the       housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at       the halldoor
as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth       turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and       while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building       the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road       which led behind it to the stables
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was       his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight
their       eyes instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with       the deepest blush
he absolutely started and for a moment seemed       immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced       towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of       perfect composure at least of perfect civility
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach       received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be       overcome
had his first appearance or his resemblance to the       picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure       the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners       expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately       have told it
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to       their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift       her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to       his civil enquiries after her family
amazed at the alteration of       his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered       was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the       impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the       few minutes in which they continued were some of the most       uncomfortable in her life
nor did he seem much more at ease       when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and       he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left       longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so       hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts
at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a       few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected       himself and took leave
the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his       figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by       her own feelings followed them in silence
she was overpowered       by shame and vexation
her coming there was the most unfortunate       the most illjudged thing in the world
how strange it must       appear to him
in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so       vain a man
it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself       in his way again
oh
why did she come
or why did he thus come       a day before he was expected
had they been only ten minutes       sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his       discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment       arrivedthat moment alighted from his horse or his carriage
she       blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting
and       his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean
that he       should even speak to her was amazingbut to speak with such       civility to enquire after her family
never in her life had she       seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with       such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting
what a contrast       did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his       letter into her hand
she knew not what to think or how to       account for it
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water       and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a       finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it       was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and       though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her       uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as       they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene
her       thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house       whichever it might be where mr darcy then was
she longed to       know what at the moment was passing in his mindin what manner he       thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was       still dear to him
perhaps he had been civil only because he felt       himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was       not like ease
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in       seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her       with composure
at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence       of mind aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more       like herself
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a       while ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where       the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many       charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long       range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the       stream
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole       park but feared it might be beyond a walk
with a triumphant       smile they were told that it was ten miles round
it settled the       matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought       them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to       the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts
they       crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air       of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet       visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed       room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough       coppicewood which bordered it
elizabeth longed to explore its       windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived       their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great       walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the       carriage as quickly as possible
her niece was therefore       obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on       the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but       their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to       indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much       engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in       the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced       but little
whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were       again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to       what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching       them and at no great distance
the walk being here less       sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before       they met
elizabeth however astonished was at least more       prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and       to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them
for a       few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into       some other path
the idea lasted while a turning in the walk       concealed him from their view the turning past he was       immediately before them
with a glance she saw that he had lost       none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she       began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she       had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when       some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise       of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed
her       colour changed and she said no more
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing       he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to       her friends
this was a stroke of civility for which she was       quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his       being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people       against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself
what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they       are
he takes them now for people of fashion        the introduction however was immediately made and as she named       their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to       see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his       decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions
that he was surprised by the connection was evident he       sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going       away turned back with them and entered into conversation with       mr gardiner
elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but       triumph
it was consoling that he should know she had some       relations for whom there was no need to blush
she listened most       attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every       expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his       intelligence his taste or his good manners
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr       darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as       often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood       offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and       pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually       most sport
mrs gardiner who was walking arminarm with       elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder
elizabeth said       nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be       all for herself
her astonishment however was extreme and       continually was she repeating why is he so altered
from what       can it proceed
it cannot be for meit cannot be for my sake       that his manners are thus softened
my reproofs at hunsford could       not work such a change as this
it is impossible that he should       still love me        after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the       two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending       to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some       curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration
it       originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the       morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and       consequently preferred her husbands
mr darcy took her place by       her niece and they walked on together
after a short silence       the lady first spoke
she wished him to know that she had been       assured of his absence before she came to the place and       accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very       unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that       you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed       before we left bakewell we understood that you were not       immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth       of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned       his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with       whom he had been travelling
they will join me early tomorrow       he continued and among them are some who will claim an       acquaintance with youmr
bingley and his sisters        elizabeth answered only by a slight bow
her thoughts were       instantly driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had       been the last mentioned between them and if she might judge by       his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged
there is also one other person in the party he continued after       a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you
will       you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to       your acquaintance during your stay at lambton        the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too       great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it
she       immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of       being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and       without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying       to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of       her
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought
elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was       flattered and pleased
his wish of introducing his sister to her       was a compliment of the highest kind
they soon outstripped the       others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs       gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind
he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself       not tired and they stood together on the lawn
at such a time       much might have been said and silence was very awkward
she       wanted to talk but there seemed to be an embargo on every       subject
at last she recollected that she had been travelling       and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance
yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas       were nearly worn out before the ttette was over
on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go       into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined       and they parted on each side with utmost politeness
mr darcy       handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off       elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of       them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they       had expected
he is perfectly well behaved polite and       unassuming said her uncle
there is something a little stately in him to be sure       replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not       unbecoming
i can now say with the housekeeper that though some       people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it        i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us
it was       more than civil it was really attentive and there was no       necessity for such attention
his acquaintance with elizabeth was       very trifling        to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as       wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his       features are perfectly good
but how came you to tell me that he       was so disagreeable        elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had       liked him better when they had met in kent than before and that       she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities       replied her uncle
your great men often are and therefore i       shall not take him at his word as he might change his mind       another day and warn me off his grounds        elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his       character but said nothing
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i       really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so       cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham
he has not       an illnatured look
on the contrary there is something pleasing       about his mouth when he speaks
and there is something of dignity       in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea       of his heart
but to be sure the good lady who showed us his       house did give him a most flaming character
i could hardly help       laughing aloud sometimes
but he is a liberal master i suppose       and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue        elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in       vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them       to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what       she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were       capable of a very different construction and that his character       was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had       been considered in hertfordshire
in confirmation of this she       related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in       which they had been connected without actually naming her       authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now       approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave       way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in       pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its       environs to think of anything else
fatigued as she had been by       the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off       again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was       spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many       years discontinuance
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave       elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she       could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcys       civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted       with his sister
chapter         elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to       visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was       consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole       of that morning
but her conclusion was false for on the very       morning after their arrival at lambton these visitors came
they       had been walking about the place with some of their new friends       and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining       with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a       window and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving       up the street
elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery       guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of her       surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour       which she expected
her uncle and aunt were all amazement and       the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the       circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the       preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business
nothing       had ever suggested it before but they felt that there was no       other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter       than by supposing a partiality for their niece
while these       newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation       of elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing
she was       quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of       disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should       have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious       to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing       would fail her
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she       walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw       such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made       everything worse
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable       introduction took place
with astonishment did elizabeth see that       her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself
since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was       exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes       convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy
she found it       difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and       though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her       appearance womanly and graceful
she was less handsome than her       brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her       manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle
elizabeth who had       expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as       ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such       different feelings
they had not long been together before mr darcy told her that       bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time       to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when       bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he       entered the room
all elizabeths anger against him had been long       done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood       its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he       expressed himself on seeing her again
he enquired in a friendly       though general way after her family and looked and spoke with       the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting       personage than to herself
they had long wished to see him
the       whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention
the       suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece       directed their observation towards each with an earnest though       guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full       conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love
of       the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that       the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough
elizabeth on her side had much to do
she wanted to ascertain       the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her       own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter       object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of       success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were       prepossessed in her favour
bingley was ready georgiana was       eager and darcy determined to be pleased
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister       and oh
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his       were directed in a like manner
sometimes she could fancy that he       talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased       herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying       to trace a resemblance
but though this might be imaginary she       could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had       been set up as a rival to jane
no look appeared on either side       that spoke particular regard
nothing occurred between them that       could justify the hopes of his sister
on this point she was soon       satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere       they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a       recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of       saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared
he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking       together and in a tone which had something of real regret that       it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing       her and before she could reply he added it is above eight       months
we have not met since the th of november when we were       all dancing together at netherfield        elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he       afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of       the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn
there was       not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there       was a look and a manner which gave them meaning
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy       himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an       expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she       heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his       companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners       which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence       might prove had at least outlived one day
when she saw him thus       seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people       with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a       disgracewhen she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to       the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected       their last lively scene in hunsford parsonagethe difference the       change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she       could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible
never       even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his       dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to       please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as       now when no importance could result from the success of his       endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his       attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and       censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings
their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour and when they       arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in       expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss       bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country
miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in       the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed
mrs gardiner       looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the       invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance       but elizabeth had turned away her head
presuming however that       this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment       than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who       was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she       ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next       was fixed on
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing       elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and       many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends
elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak       of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some       others found herself when their visitors left them capable of       considering the last halfhour with some satisfaction though       while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little
eager       to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and       aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their       favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity       it was not their wish to force her communication
it was evident       that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had       before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love       with her
they saw much to interest but nothing to justify       enquiry
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and       as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find
they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn       his character from their own feelings and his servants report       without any reference to any other account the circle in       hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it       for mr darcy
there was now an interest however in believing       the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority       of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and       whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily       rejected
neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of       their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably       had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants       of a small markettown where the family did not visit
it was       acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much       good among the poor
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was       not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his       concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood       it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derbyshire he       had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards       discharged
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening       more than the last and the evening though as it passed it       seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings       towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours       endeavouring to make them out
she certainly did not hate him
no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been       ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so       called
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable       qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some       time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now       heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony       so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in       so amiable a light which yesterday had produced
but above all       above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of       goodwill which could not be overlooked
it was gratitude       gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving       her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony       of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations       accompanying her rejection
he who she had been persuaded would       avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental       meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any       indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where       their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good       opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his       sister
such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only       astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be       attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be       encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be       exactly defined
she respected she esteemed she was grateful to       him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted       to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself       and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should       employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed       of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the       niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to       see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had       reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though       it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their       side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to       wait on her at pemberley the following morning
they were       therefore to go
elizabeth was pleased though when she asked       herself the reason she had very little to say in reply
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast
the fishing scheme       had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made       of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon
chapter         convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her       had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how       unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was       curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the       acquaintance would now be renewed
on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the       saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer
its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing       view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the       beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over       the intermediate lawn
in this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting       there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom       she lived in london
georgianas reception of them was very       civil but attended with all the embarrassment which though       proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily       give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her       being proud and reserved
mrs gardiner and her niece however       did her justice and pitied her
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a       curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such       pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments
it was first       broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman       whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to       be more truly wellbred than either of the others and between       her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the       conversation was carried on
miss darcy looked as if she wished       for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a       short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss       bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss       darcy without calling her attention
this observation would not       have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they       not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not       sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much
her own thoughts       were employing her
she expected every moment that some of the       gentlemen would enter the room
she wished she feared that the       master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished       or feared it most she could scarcely determine
after sitting in       this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys       voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry       after the health of her family
she answered with equal       indifference and brevity and the other said no more
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the       entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all       the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till       after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to       miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post
there was       now employment for the whole partyfor though they could not all       talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes       nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding       whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr       darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room       and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes       to predominate she began to regret that he came
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three       other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had       left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended       a visit to georgiana that morning
no sooner did he appear than       elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed       a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the       more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the       whole party were awakened against them and that there was       scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first       came into the room
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so       strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles       which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its       objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her       attentions to mr darcy were by no means over
miss darcy on her       brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and       elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to       get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt       at conversation on either side
miss bingley saw all this       likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first       opportunity of saying with sneering civility        pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from       meryton
they must be a great loss to your family        in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but       elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her       thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave       her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel       the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a       tolerably detached tone
while she spoke an involuntary glance       showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking       at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to       lift up her eyes
had miss bingley known what pain she was then       giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained       from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose       elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she       believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which       might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the       latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of       her family were connected with that corps
not a syllable had       ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement
to no       creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except       to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was       particularly anxious to conceal it from the very wish which       elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming       hereafter her own
he had certainly formed such a plan and       without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate       him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something       to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his       emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not       approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time       though not enough to be able to speak any more
her brother       whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest       in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed       to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on       her more and more cheerfully
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer       above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their       carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on       elizabeths person behaviour and dress
but georgiana would not       join her
her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her       favour his judgement could not err
and he had spoken in such       terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of       finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable
when darcy       returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to       him some part of what she had been saying to his sister
how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy       she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she       is since the winter
she is grown so brown and coarse
louisa and       i were agreeing that we should not have known her again        however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he       contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other       alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous       consequence of travelling in the summer
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never       could see any beauty in her
her face is too thin her complexion       has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome
her       nose wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines
her       teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for       her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i could never       see anything extraordinary in them
they have a sharp shrewish       look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there       is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable        persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this       was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people       are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat       nettled she had all the success she expected
he was resolutely       silent however and from a determination of making him speak       she continued        i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed       we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i       particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been       dining at netherfield she a beautyi should as soon call her       mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i       believe you thought her rather pretty at one time        yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but       that was only when i first saw her for it is many months since       i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my       acquaintance        he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the       satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any       pain but herself
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred       during their visit as they returned except what had       particularly interested them both
the look and behaviour of       everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who       had mostly engaged their attention
they talked of his sister       his friends his house his fruitof everything but himself yet       elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him       and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces       beginning the subject
chapter         elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a       letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this       disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had       now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and       her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at       once on one of which was marked that it had been missent       elsewhere
elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written       the direction remarkably ill
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and       her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off       by themselves
the one missent must first be attended to it had       been written five days ago
the beginning contained an account of       all their little parties and engagements with such news as the       country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day       later and written in evident agitation gave more important       intelligence
it was to this effect        since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred       of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of       alarming yoube assured that we are all well
what i have to say       relates to poor lydia
an express came at twelve last night just       as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us       that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to       own the truth with wickham
imagine our surprise
to kitty       however it does not seem so wholly unexpected
i am very very       sorry
so imprudent a match on both sides
but i am willing to       hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this       step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart
his       choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can       give her nothing
our poor mother is sadly grieved
my father       bears it better
how thankful am i that we never let them know       what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves
they       were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were       not missed till yesterday morning at eight
the express was sent       off directly
my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten       miles of us
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here       soon
lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their       intention
i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor       mother
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i       hardly know what i have written        without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely       knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter       instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost       impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than       the conclusion of the first
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried       letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not       confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer       for being coherent
dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would       write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed
imprudent as the marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia       would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place       for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to       scotland
colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton       the day before not many hours after the express
though lydias       short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were       going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing       his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia       at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking       the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route
he did       trace them easily to clapham but no further for on entering       that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the       chaise that brought them from epsom
all that is known after this       is that they were seen to continue the london road
i know not       what to think
after making every possible enquiry on that side       london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing       them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and       hatfield but without any successno such people had been seen to       pass through
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn       and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to       his heart
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one       can throw any blame on them
our distress my dear lizzy is very       great
my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think       so ill of him
many circumstances might make it more eligible for       them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first       plan and even if he could form such a design against a young       woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose       her so lost to everything
impossible
i grieve to find however       that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he       shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w       was not a man to be trusted
my poor mother is really ill and       keeps her room
could she exert herself it would be better but       this is not to be expected
and as to my father i never in my       life saw him so affected
poor kitty has anger for having       concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence       one cannot wonder
i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have       been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as       the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return
i am not so selfish however as to press for it if       inconvenient
adieu
i take up my pen again to do what i have       just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i       cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as       possible
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not       afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to       ask of the former
my father is going to london with colonel       forster instantly to try to discover her
what he means to do i       am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him       to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel       forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening
in       such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be       everything in the world he will immediately comprehend what i       must feel and i rely upon his goodness        oh
where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her       seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him       without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she       reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy       appeared
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and       before he could recover himself to speak she in whose mind       every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily       exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you
i must find       mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i       have not an instant to lose        good god
what is the matter cried he with more feeling than       politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a       minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs       gardiner
you are not well enough you cannot go yourself        elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she       felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them
calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though       in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to       fetch his master and mistress home instantly
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself       and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to       leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and       commiseration let me call your maid
is there nothing you could       take to give you present relief
a glass of wine shall i get you       one
you are very ill        no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself
there is nothing the matter with me
i am quite well i am only       distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from       longbourn        she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes       could not speak another word
darcy in wretched suspense could       only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her       in compassionate silence
at length she spoke again
i have just       had a letter from jane with such dreadful news
it cannot be       concealed from anyone
my younger sister has left all her       friendshas eloped has thrown herself into the power ofof mr       wickham
they are gone off together from brighton
you know him       too well to doubt the rest
she has no money no connections       nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever        darcy was fixed in astonishment
when i consider she added in       a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it
i       who knew what he was
had i but explained some part of it       onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family
had his       character been known this could not have happened
but it is       allall too late now        i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked
but is it       certainabsolutely certain        oh yes
they left brighton together on sunday night and were       traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not       gone to scotland        and what has been done what has been attempted to recover       her        my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my       uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in       halfanhour
but nothing can be donei know very well that       nothing can be done
how is such a man to be worked on
how are       they even to be discovered
i have not the smallest hope
it is       every way horrible        darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence
when my eyes were opened to his real characteroh
had i known       what i ought what i dared to do
but i knew noti was afraid of       doing too much
wretched wretched mistake        darcy made no answer
he seemed scarcely to hear her and was       walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow       contracted his air gloomy
elizabeth soon observed and       instantly understood it
her power was sinking everything must       sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of       the deepest disgrace
she could neither wonder nor condemn but       the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to       her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress
it was on the       contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own       wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have       loved him as now when all love must be vain
but self though it would intrude could not engross her
lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all       soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with       her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else       and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a       sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a       manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise       restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my       absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but       real though unavailing concern
would to heaven that anything       could be either said or done on my part that might offer       consolation to such distress
but i will not torment you with       vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks
this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having       the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today        oh yes
be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy
say       that urgent business calls us home immediately
conceal the       unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be       long        he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow       for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was       at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her       relations with only one serious parting look went away
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that       they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality       as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she       threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their       acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at       the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted       its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its       termination
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection       elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor       faulty
but if otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is       unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often       described as arising on a first interview with its object and       even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in       her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the       latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill       success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less       interesting mode of attachment
be that as it may she saw him go       with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy       must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that       wretched business
never since reading janes second letter had       she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her
no one       but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an       expectation
surprise was the least of her feelings on this       development
while the contents of the first letter remained in       her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham       should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for       money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared       incomprehensible
but now it was all too natural
for such an       attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though       she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an       elopement without the intention of marriage she had no       difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her       understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire       that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that       lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody
sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite       as their attentions raised them in her opinion
her affections       had continually been fluctuating but never without an object
the       mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a       girloh
how acutely did she now feel it
she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot       to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon       her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable       of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost       persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles       interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered       the room her impatience was severe
mr and mrs gardiner had       hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that       their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly       on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their       summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the       postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had       never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not       but be deeply afflicted
not lydia only but all were concerned       in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror       mr gardiner promised every assistance in his power
elizabeth       though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude       and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating       to their journey was speedily settled
they were to be off as       soon as possible
but what is to be done about pemberley cried       mrs gardiner
john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for       us was it so        yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our       engagement
that is all settled        that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her       room to prepare
and are they upon such terms as for her to       disclose the real truth
oh that i knew how it was        but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her       in the hurry and confusion of the following hour
had elizabeth       been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that       all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but       she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst       the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at       lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure
an hour       however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile       having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be       done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the       morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could       have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to       longbourn
chapter         i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle       as they drove from the town and really upon serious       consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as       your eldest sister does on the matter
it appears to me so very       unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a       girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was       actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly       inclined to hope the best
could he expect that her friends would       not step forward
could he expect to be noticed again by the       regiment after such an affront to colonel forster
his       temptation is not adequate to the risk        do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a       moment
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your       uncles opinion
it is really too great a violation of decency       honour and interest for him to be guilty of
i cannot think so       very ill of wickham
can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him       up as to believe him capable of it        not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other       neglect i can believe him capable
if indeed it should be so
but i dare not hope it
why should they not go on to scotland if       that had been the case        in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute       proof that they are not gone to scotland        oh
but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is       such a presumption
and besides no traces of them were to be       found on the barnet road        well thensupposing them to be in london
they may be there       though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional       purpose
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on       either side and it might strike them that they could be more       economically though less expeditiously married in london than       in scotland        but why all this secrecy
why any fear of detection
why must       their marriage be private
oh no nothis is not likely
his       most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded       of his never intending to marry her
wickham will never marry a       woman without some money
he cannot afford it
and what claims       has lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth health and good       humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of       benefiting himself by marrying well
as to what restraint the       apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a       dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i       know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce
but       as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good
lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from       my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little       attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in       his family that he would do as little and think as little       about it as any father could do in such a matter        but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love       of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than       marriage        it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied       elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of       decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt
but       really i know not what to say
perhaps i am not doing her       justice
but she is very young she has never been taught to       think on serious subjects and for the last halfyear nay for a       twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement and       vanity
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most       idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in       her way
since the shire were first quartered in meryton       nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head
she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and       talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call it
susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively       enough
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person       and address that can captivate a woman        but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very       ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt        of whom does jane ever think ill
and who is there whatever       might be their former conduct that she would think capable of       such an attempt till it were proved against them
but jane       knows as well as i do what wickham really is
we both know that       he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has       neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful       as he is insinuating        and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose       curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring
i told you the       other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you       yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke       of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality       towards him
and there are other circumstances which i am not at       libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about       the whole pemberley family are endless
from what he said of miss       darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved       disagreeable girl
yet he knew to the contrary himself
he must       know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found       her        but does lydia know nothing of this
can she be ignorant of what       you and jane seem so well to understand        oh yesthat that is the worst of all
till i was in kent and       saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel       fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself
and when i       returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or       fortnights time
as that was the case neither jane to whom i       related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our       knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any       one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him       should then be overthrown
and even when it was settled that       lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her       eyes to his character never occurred to me
that she could be       in any danger from the deception never entered my head
that such       a consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was       far enough from my thoughts        when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason       i suppose to believe them fond of each other        not the slightest
i can remember no symptom of affection on       either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you       must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be       thrown away
when first he entered the corps she was ready       enough to admire him but so we all were
every girl in or near       meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months       but he never distinguished her by any particular attention       and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and       wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the       regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her       favourites        it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could       be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this       interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could       detain them from it long during the whole of the journey
from       elizabeths thoughts it was never absent
fixed there by the       keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find no interval       of ease or forgetfulness
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one       night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not       have been wearied by long expectations
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were       standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock       and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise       that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their       whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first       pleasing earnest of their welcome
elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty       kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running       down from her mothers apartment immediately met her
elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears       filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether       anything had been heard of the fugitives
not yet replied jane
but now that my dear uncle is come i       hope everything will be well        is my father in town        yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word        and have you heard from him often        we have heard only twice
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday       to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his       directions which i particularly begged him to do
he merely       added that he should not write again till he had something of       importance to mention        and my motherhow is she
how are you all        my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are       greatly shaken
she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction       in seeing you all
she does not yet leave her dressingroom
mary       and kitty thank heaven are quite well        but youhow are you cried elizabeth
you look pale
how much       you must have gone through        her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and       their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs       gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to       by the approach of the whole party
jane ran to her uncle and       aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles       and tears
when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which       elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the       others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to       give
the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence       of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still       expected that it would all end well and that every morning would       bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain       their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few       minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be       expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives       against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her       own sufferings and illusage blaming everybody but the person to       whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must       principally be owing
if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to       brighton with all my family this would not have happened but       poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her
why did the       forsters ever let her go out of their sight
i am sure there was       some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the       kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked       after
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge       of her but i was overruled as i always am
poor dear child
and       now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight       wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and       what is to become of us all
the collinses will turn us out       before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us       brother i do not know what we shall do        they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner       after general assurances of his affection for her and all her       family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day       and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering       lydia
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right       to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it       as certain
it is not quite a week since they left brighton
in a       few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know       that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not       let us give the matter over as lost
as soon as i get to town i       shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to       gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what       is to be done        oh
my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what       i could most wish for
and now do when you get to town find       them out wherever they may be and if they are not married       already make them marry
and as for wedding clothes do not       let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much       money as she chooses to buy them after they are married
and       above all keep mr bennet from fighting
tell him what a       dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my witsand       have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuch spasms       in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that       i can get no rest by night nor by day
and tell my dear lydia not       to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me       for she does not know which are the best warehouses
oh brother       how kind you are
i know you will contrive it all        but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest       endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation       to her as well in her hopes as her fear and after talking with       her in this manner till dinner was on the table they all left       her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in       the absence of her daughters
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no       real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not       attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence       enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited       at table and judged it better that one only of the household       and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her       fears and solicitude on the subject
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who       had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make       their appearance before
one came from her books and the other       from her toilette
the faces of both however were tolerably       calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss       of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself       incurred in this business had given more of fretfulness than       usual to the accents of kitty
as for mary she was mistress       enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of       grave reflection soon after they were seated at table        this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much       talked of
but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the       wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation        then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she       added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from       it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is       irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin       that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and       that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the       undeserving of the other sex        elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much       oppressed to make any reply
mary however continued to console       herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before       them
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for       halfanhour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed       herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane       was equally eager to satisfy
after joining in general       lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which       elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could       not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the       subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it       which i have not already heard
give me further particulars
what       did colonel forster say
had they no apprehension of anything       before the elopement took place
they must have seen them       together for ever        colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some       partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him       any alarm
i am so grieved for him
his behaviour was attentive       and kind to the utmost
he was coming to us in order to assure       us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone       to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened       his journey        and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry
did he       know of their intending to go off
had colonel forster seen denny       himself        yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing       anything of their plans and would not give his real opinion       about it
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not       marryingand from that i am inclined to hope he might have       been misunderstood before        and till colonel forster came himself not one of you       entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married        how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains
i       felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness       with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not       been always quite right
my father and mother knew nothing of       that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be
kitty then       owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest       of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such       a step
she had known it seems of their being in love with each       other many weeks        but not before they went to brighton        no i believe not        and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself
does he know his real character        i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he       formerly did
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant
and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he       left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false        oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of       him this could not have happened        perhaps it would have been better replied her sister
but to       expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their       present feelings were seemed unjustifiable
we acted with the       best intentions        could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to       his wife        he brought it with him for us to see        jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth
these were the contents        my dear harriet       you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help       laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i       am missed
i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess       with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man       in the world i love and he is an angel
i should never be happy       without him so think it no harm to be off
you need not send       them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it       will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign       my name lydia wickham what a good joke it will be
i can       hardly write for laughing
pray make my excuses to pratt for not       keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight
tell him i       hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will       dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure
i       shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you       would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown       before they are packed up
goodbye
give my love to colonel       forster
i hope you will drink to our good journey
your affectionate friend       lydia bennet        oh
thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she       had finished it
what a letter is this to be written at such a       moment
but at least it shows that she was serious on the       subject of their journey
whatever he might afterwards persuade       her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy
my poor       father
how he must have felt it        i never saw anyone so shocked
he could not speak a word for       full ten minutes
my mother was taken ill immediately and the       whole house in such confusion        oh
jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it       who did not know the whole story before the end of the day        i do not know
i hope there was
but to be guarded at such a       time is very difficult
my mother was in hysterics and though i       endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid       i did not do so much as i might have done
but the horror of what       might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties        your attendance upon her has been too much for you
you do not       look well
oh that i had been with you
you have had every care       and anxiety upon yourself alone        mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in       every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either       of them
kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much       that her hours of repose should not be broken in on
my aunt       phillips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away       and was so good as to stay till thursday with me
she was of       great use and comfort to us all
and lady lucas has been very       kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us       and offered her services or any of her daughters if they       should be of use to us        she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps       she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one       cannot see too little of ones neighbours
assistance is       impossible condolence insufferable
let them triumph over us at       a distance and be satisfied        she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father       had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his       daughter
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place       where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if       anything could be made out from them
his principal object must       be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them       from clapham
it had come with a fare from london and as he       thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing       from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make       enquiries at clapham
if he could anyhow discover at what house       the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make       enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out       the stand and number of the coach
i do not know of any other       designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be       gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had       difficulty in finding out even so much as this     chapter         the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the       next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line       from him
his family knew him to be on all common occasions a       most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time       they had hoped for exertion
they were forced to conclude that he       had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they       would have been glad to be certain
mr gardiner had waited only       for the letters before he set off
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving       constant information of what was going on and their uncle       promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to       longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his       sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands       not being killed in a duel
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a       few days longer as the former thought her presence might be       serviceable to her nieces
she shared in their attendance on mrs       bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of       freedom
their other aunt also visited them frequently and       always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening       them upthough as she never came without reporting some fresh       instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom       went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found       them
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three       months before had been almost an angel of light
he was declared       to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues       all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into       every tradesmans family
everybody declared that he was the       wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out       that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness
elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said       believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin       more certain and even jane who believed still less of it       became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come       when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before       entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained       some news of them
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife       received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he       had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come       to gracechurch street that mr bennet had been to epsom and       clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory       information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the       principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they       might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london       before they procured lodgings
mr gardiner himself did not       expect any success from this measure but as his brother was       eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it
he added that       mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london       and promised to write again very soon
there was also a       postscript to this effect        i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if       possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment       whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be       likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself
if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability       of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential       consequence
at present we have nothing to guide us
colonel       forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy       us on this head
but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could       tell us what relations he has now living better than any other       person        elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference       to her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give       any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment       deserved
she had never heard of his having had any relations       except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many       years
it was possible however that some of his companions in       the shire might be able to give more information and though       she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a       something to look forward to
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most       anxious part of each was when the post was expected
the arrival       of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience
through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be       communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some       news of importance
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived       for their father from a different quarter from mr collins       which as jane had received directions to open all that came for       him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew       what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and       read it likewise
it was as follows        my dear sir       i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation       in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are       now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a       letter from hertfordshire
be assured my dear sir that mrs       collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your       respectable family in your present distress which must be of       the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time       can remove
no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can       alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you under a       circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a       parents mind
the death of your daughter would have been a       blessing in comparison of this
and it is the more to be       lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte       informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your       daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence       though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and       mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must       be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity       at so early an age
howsoever that may be you are grievously to       be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins       but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have       related the affair
they agree with me in apprehending that this       false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of       all the others for who as lady catherine herself       condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with       augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for       had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your       sorrow and disgrace
let me then advise you dear sir to console       yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child       from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of       her own heinous offense
i am dear sir etc etc        mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer       from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant       nature to send
it was not known that wickham had a single       relationship with whom he kept up any connection and it was       certain that he had no near one living
his former acquaintances       had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did       not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any       of them
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as       likely to give any news of him
and in the wretched state of his       own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in       addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it       had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a       very considerable amount
colonel forster believed that more than       a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at       brighton
he owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour       were still more formidable
mr gardiner did not attempt to       conceal these particulars from the longbourn family
jane heard       them with horror
a gamester she cried
this is wholly       unexpected
i had not an idea of it        mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see       their father at home on the following day which was saturday
rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours       he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would       return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion       might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit
when       mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much       satisfaction as her children expected considering what her       anxiety for his life had been before
what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried
sure he will not leave london before he has found them
who is       to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away        as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that       she and the children should go to london at the same time that       mr bennet came from it
the coach therefore took them the       first stage of their journey and brought its master back to       longbourn
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and       her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the       world
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them       by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs       gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from       him had ended in nothing
elizabeth had received none since her       return that could come from pemberley
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse       for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore       could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who       was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings       was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she       could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better
it       would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of       two
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual       philosophic composure
he said as little as he had ever been in       the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had       taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had       courage to speak of it
it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea       that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on       her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured       he replied say nothing of that
who should suffer but myself
it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it        you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth
you may well warn me against such an evil
human nature is so       prone to fall into it
no lizzy let me once in my life feel how       much i have been to blame
i am not afraid of being overpowered       by the impression
it will pass away soon enough        do you suppose them to be in london        yes where else can they be so well concealed        and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty
she is happy then said her father drily and her residence       there will probably be of some duration        then after a short silence he continued        lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice       to me last may which considering the event shows some       greatness of mind        they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her       mothers tea
this is a parade he cried which does one good it gives such       an elegance to misfortune
another day i will do the same i will       sit in my library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as       much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty       runs away        i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully
if i       should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia        you go to brighton
i would not trust you so near it as       eastbourne for fifty pounds
no kitty i have at last learnt to       be cautious and you will feel the effects of it
no officer is       ever to enter into my house again nor even to pass through the       village
balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up       with one of your sisters
and you are never to stir out of doors       till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day       in a rational manner        kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to       cry
well well said he do not make yourself unhappy
if you are       a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review       at the end of them     chapter         two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were       walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the       housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to       call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead       of the expected summons when they approached her she said to       miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but       i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i       took the liberty of coming to ask        what do you mean hill
we have heard nothing from town        dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment dont you       know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner
he       has been here this halfhour and master has had a letter        away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom from       thence to the library their father was in neither and they were       on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when       they were met by the butler who said        if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards       the little copse        upon this information they instantly passed through the hall       once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was       deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of       the paddock
jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as       elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for       breath came up with him and eagerly cried out        oh papa what newswhat news
have you heard from my uncle        yes i have had a letter from him by express        well and what news does it bringgood or bad        what is there of good to be expected said he taking the       letter from his pocket
but perhaps you would like to read it        elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand
jane now came up
read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself       what it is about        gracechurch street monday august 
my dear brother       at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such       as upon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction
soon       after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out       in what part of london they were
the particulars i reserve till       we meet it is enough to know they are discovered
i have seen       them both           then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are           married        elizabeth read on        i have seen them both
they are not married nor can i find       there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to       perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your       side i hope it will not be long before they are
all that is       required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement       her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your       children after the decease of yourself and my sister and       moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during       your life one hundred pounds per annum
these are conditions       which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying       with as far as i thought myself privileged for you
i shall       send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me       your answer
you will easily comprehend from these particulars       that mr wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are       generally believed to be
the world has been deceived in that       respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money       even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in       addition to her own fortune
if as i conclude will be the case       you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole       of this business i will immediately give directions to       haggerston for preparing a proper settlement
there will not be       the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore       stay quiet at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care
send back your answer as fast as you can and be careful to write       explicitly
we have judged it best that my niece should be       married from this house of which i hope you will approve
she       comes to us today
i shall write again as soon as anything more       is determined on
yours etc        edw
gardiner        is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished
can it       be possible that he will marry her        wickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said       her sister
my dear father i congratulate you        and have you answered the letter cried elizabeth
no but it must be done soon        most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time       before he wrote
oh
my dear father she cried come back and write       immediately
consider how important every moment is in such a       case        let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble       yourself        i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done        and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the       house
and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must       be complied with        complied with
i am only ashamed of his asking so little        and they must marry
yet he is such a man        yes yes they must marry
there is nothing else to be done
but       there are two things that i want very much to know one is how       much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the       other how am i ever to pay him        money
my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir        i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight       a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty       after i am gone        that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred       to me before
his debts to be discharged and something still to       remain
oh
it must be my uncles doings
generous good man i       am afraid he has distressed himself
a small sum could not do all       this        no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a       farthing less than ten thousand pounds
i should be sorry to       think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship        ten thousand pounds
heaven forbid
how is half such a sum to be       repaid        mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought       continued silent till they reached the house
their father then       went on to the library to write and the girls walked into the       breakfastroom
and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as       they were by themselves
how strange this is
and for this we       are to be thankful
that they should marry small as is their       chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are       forced to rejoice
oh lydia        i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he       certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for       her
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing       him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like       it has been advanced
he has children of his own and may have       more
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds        if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been       said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our       sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for       them because wickham has not sixpence of his own
the kindness       of my uncle and aunt can never be requited
their taking her       home and affording her their personal protection and       countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of       gratitude cannot enough acknowledge
by this time she is actually       with them
if such goodness does not make her miserable now she       will never deserve to be happy
what a meeting for her when she       first sees my aunt        we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side       said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy
his       consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is       come to a right way of thinking
their mutual affection will       steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly       and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past       imprudence forgotten        their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither       you nor i nor anybody can ever forget
it is useless to talk of       it        it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all       likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened
they went to       the library therefore and asked their father whether he would       not wish them to make it known to her
he was writing and       without raising his head coolly replied        just as you please        may we take my uncles letter to read to her        take whatever you like and get away        elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went       up stairs together
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet       one communication would therefore do for all
after a slight       preparation for good news the letter was read aloud
mrs bennet       could hardly contain herself
as soon as jane had read mr       gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst       forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance
she       was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever       been fidgety from alarm and vexation
to know that her daughter       would be married was enough
she was disturbed by no fear for her       felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct
my dear dear lydia she cried
this is delightful indeed
she       will be married
i shall see her again
she will be married at       sixteen
my good kind brother
i knew how it would be
i knew he       would manage everything
how i long to see her
and to see dear       wickham too
but the clothes the wedding clothes
i will write       to my sister gardiner about them directly
lizzy my dear run       down to your father and ask him how much he will give her
stay       stay i will go myself
ring the bell kitty for hill
i will       put on my things in a moment
my dear dear lydia
how merry we       shall be together when we meet        her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the       violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the       obligations which mr gardiners behaviour laid them all under
for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a       great measure to his kindness
we are persuaded that he has       pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money        well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it       but her own uncle
if he had not had a family of his own i and       my children must have had all his money you know and it is the       first time we have ever had anything from him except a few       presents
well
i am so happy
in a short time i shall have a       daughter married
mrs wickham
how well it sounds
and she was       only sixteen last june
my dear jane i am in such a flutter       that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write       for me
we will settle with your father about the money       afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately        she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin       and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful       orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her       to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted
one days       delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother       was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual
other schemes       too came into her head
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and       tell the good good news to my sister philips
and as i come       back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long
kitty run down and       order the carriage
an airing would do me a great deal of good i       am sure
girls can i do anything for you in meryton
oh
here       comes hill
my dear hill have you heard the good news
miss       lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of       punch to make merry at her wedding        mrs hill began instantly to express her joy
elizabeth received       her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this       folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with       freedom
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it       was no worse she had need to be thankful
she felt it so and       though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor       worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in       looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she       felt all the advantages of what they had gained
chapter         mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life       that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an       annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his       wife if she survived him
he now wished it more than ever
had       he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been       indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now       be purchased for her
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of       the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband       might then have rested in its proper place
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to       anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his       brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out       the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as       soon as he could
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be       perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son
the       son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should       be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means       be provided for
five daughters successively entered the world       but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years       after lydias birth had been certain that he would
this event       had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be       saving
mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands       love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their       income
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs       bennet and the children
but in what proportions it should be       divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents
this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now       to be settled and mr bennet could have no hesitation in       acceding to the proposal before him
in terms of grateful       acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed       most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect       approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil       the engagements that had been made for him
he had never before       supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his       daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to       himself as by the present arrangement
he would scarcely be ten       pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them       for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual       presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands       lydias expenses had been very little within that sum
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side       too was another very welcome surprise for his wish at present       was to have as little trouble in the business as possible
when       the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in       seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former       indolence
his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory       in undertaking business he was quick in its execution
he begged       to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his       brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her
the good news spread quickly through the house and with       proportionate speed through the neighbourhood
it was borne in       the latter with decent philosophy
to be sure it would have been       more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come       upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded       from the world in some distant farmhouse
but there was much to       be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her       welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old       ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this       change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery       was considered certain
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been downstairs but on       this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table       and in spirits oppressively high
no sentiment of shame gave a       damp to her triumph
the marriage of a daughter which had been       the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on       the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran       wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new       carriages and servants
she was busily searching through the       neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and       without knowing or considering what their income might be       rejected many as deficient in size and importance
haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit       itor the great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger       but ashworth is too far off
i could not bear to have her ten       miles from me and as for pulvis lodge the attics are dreadful        her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the       servants remained
but when they had withdrawn he said to her       mrs
bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your       son and daughter let us come to a right understanding
into       one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have       admittance
i will not encourage the impudence of either by       receiving them at longbourn        a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was       firm
it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with       amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea       to buy clothes for his daughter
he protested that she should       receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it
that his anger could be       carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse       his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would       scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe possible
she       was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must       reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at       her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took       place
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the       distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted       with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so       shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might       hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who       were not immediately on the spot
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means
there       were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently       depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge       of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so muchnot       however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to       herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between       them
had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable       terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect       himself with a family where to every other objection would now       be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a       man whom he so justly scorned
from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink
the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself       of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation       survive such a blow as this
she was humbled she was grieved       she repented though she hardly knew of what
she became jealous       of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by       it
she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance       of gaining intelligence
she was convinced that she could have       been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should       meet
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that       the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago       would now have been most gladly and gratefully received
he was       as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex       but while he was mortal there must be a triumph
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in       disposition and talents would most suit her
his understanding       and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her       wishes
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of       both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been       softened his manners improved and from his judgement       information and knowledge of the world she must have received       benefit of greater importance
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude       what connubial felicity really was
an union of a different       tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon       to be formed in their family
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable       independence she could not imagine
but how little of permanent       happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together       because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could       easily conjecture
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother
to mr bennets       acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his       eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and       concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be       mentioned to him again
the principal purport of his letter was       to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the       militia
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon       as his marriage was fixed on
and i think you will agree with me       in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable       both on his account and my nieces
it is mr wickhams intention       to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are       still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army
he       has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now       quartered in the north
it is an advantage to have it so far from       this part of the kingdom
he promises fairly and i hope among       different people where they may each have a character to       preserve they will both be more prudent
i have written to       colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and       to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr       wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment       for which i have pledged myself
and will you give yourself the       trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in       meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his       information
he has given in all his debts i hope at least he       has not deceived us
haggerston has our directions and all will       be completed in a week
they will then join his regiment unless       they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs       gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before       she leaves the south
she is well and begs to be dutifully       remembered to you and her motheryours etc        e
gardiner        mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams       removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do
but       mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it
lydias being       settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure       and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her       plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe       disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia       should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with       everybody and had so many favourites
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite       shocking to send her away
and there are several of the young       men too that she likes very much
the officers may not be so       pleasant in general s regiment        his daughters request for such it might be considered of being       admitted into her family again before she set off for the north       received at first an absolute negative
but jane and elizabeth       who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings       and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by       her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so       mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as       they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they       thought and act as they wished
and their mother had the       satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her       married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to       the north
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore       he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that       as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to       longbourn
elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should       consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own       inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object       of her wishes
chapter         their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt       for her probably more than she felt for herself
the carriage was       sent to meet them at  and they were to return in it by       dinnertime
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets       and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would       have attended herself had she been the culprit and was       wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure
they came
the family were assembled in the breakfast room to       receive them
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the       carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably       grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown       open and she ran into the room
her mother stepped forwards       embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with       an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and       wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of       their happiness
their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was       not quite so cordial
his countenance rather gained in austerity       and he scarcely opened his lips
the easy assurance of the young       couple indeed was enough to provoke him
elizabeth was       disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked
lydia was lydia       still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless
she turned       from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when       at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took       notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a       laugh that it was a great while since she had been there
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his       manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his       marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy       address while he claimed their relationship would have       delighted them all
elizabeth had not before believed him quite       equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within       herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an       impudent man
she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of       the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of       colour
there was no want of discourse
the bride and her mother could       neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to       sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in       that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very       unable to equal in her replies
they seemed each of them to have       the happiest memories in the world
nothing of the past was       recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects       which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world
only think of its being three months she cried since i went       away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been       things enough happened in the time
good gracious
when i went       away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came       back again
though i thought it would be very good fun if i was        her father lifted up his eyes
jane was distressed
elizabeth       looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw       anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued       oh
mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married today
i       was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in       his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let       down the sideglass next to him and took off my glove and let       my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the       ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything        elizabeth could bear it no longer
she got up and ran out of the       room and returned no more till she heard them passing through       the hall to the dining parlour
she then joined them soon enough       to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right       hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah
jane i take       your place now and you must go lower because i am a married       woman        it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that       embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first
her ease and good spirits increased
she longed to see mrs       phillips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to       hear herself called mrs
wickham by each of them and in the       mean time she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of       being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the       breakfast room and what do you think of my husband
is not he a       charming man
i am sure my sisters must all envy me
i only hope       they may have half my good luck
they must all go to brighton
that is the place to get husbands
what a pity it is mamma we       did not all go        very true and if i had my will we should
but my dear lydia i       dont at all like your going such a way off
must it be so        oh lord
yesthere is nothing in that
i shall like it of all       things
you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us
we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there       will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for       them all        i should like it beyond anything said her mother
and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my       sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them       before the winter is over        i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i       do not particularly like your way of getting husbands        their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them
mr       wickham had received his commission before he left london and he       was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so       short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with       her daughter and having very frequent parties at home
these       parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even       more desirable to such as did think than such as did not
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had       expected to find it not equal to lydias for him
she had       scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the       reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the       strength of her love rather than by his and she would have       wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope       with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was       rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were       the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of       having a companion
lydia was exceedingly fond of him
he was her dear wickham on       every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him
he       did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill       more birds on the first of september than any body else in the       country
one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with       her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth        lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe
you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it
are not you curious to hear how it was managed        no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too       little said on the subject        la
you are so strange
but i must tell you how it went off
we       were married you know at st clements because wickhams       lodgings were in that parish
and it was settled that we should       all be there by eleven oclock
my uncle and aunt and i were to       go together and the others were to meet us at the church
well       monday morning came and i was in such a fuss
i was so afraid       you know that something would happen to put it off and then i       should have gone quite distracted
and there was my aunt all the       time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she       was reading a sermon
however i did not hear above one word in       ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham
i       longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat        well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would       never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my       uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with       them
if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of       doors though i was there a fortnight
not one party or scheme       or anything
to be sure london was rather thin but however the       little theatre was open
well and so just as the carriage came       to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that       horrid man mr stone
and then you know when once they get       together there is no end of it
well i was so frightened i did       not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we       were beyond the hour we could not be married all day
but       luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all       set out
however i recollected afterwards that if he had been       prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy       might have done as well        mr
darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement
oh yeshe was to come there with wickham you know
but       gracious me
i quite forgot
i ought not to have said a word       about it
i promised them so faithfully
what will wickham say
it was to be such a secret        if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the       subject
you may depend upon my seeking no further        oh
certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity       we will ask you no questions        thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell       you all and then wickham would be angry        on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out       of her power by running away
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at       least it was impossible not to try for information
mr darcy had       been at her sisters wedding
it was exactly a scene and exactly       among people where he had apparently least to do and least       temptation to go
conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and       wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none
those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the       noblest light seemed most improbable
she could not bear such       suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short       letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had       dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been       intended
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must       be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and       comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have       been amongst you at such a time
pray write instantly and let me       understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in       the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must       endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance        not that i shall though she added to herself as she       finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in       an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and       stratagems to find it out        janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to       elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was       glad of ittill it appeared whether her enquiries would receive       any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante
chapter         elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her       letter as soon as she possibly could
she was no sooner in       possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she       was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the       benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter       convinced her that it did not contain a denial
gracechurch street sept

my dear niece        i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole       morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing       will not comprise what i have to tell you
i must confess myself       surprised by your application i did not expect it from you
dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know       that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your       side
if you do not choose to understand me forgive my       impertinence
your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing       but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed       him to act as he has done
but if you are really innocent and       ignorant i must be more explicit
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had       a most unexpected visitor
mr darcy called and was shut up with       him several hours
it was all over before i arrived so my       curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have       been
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where       your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked       with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once
from what i can       collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and       came to town with the resolution of hunting for them
the motive       professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that       wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it       impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in       him
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and       confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his       private actions open to the world
his character was to speak for       itself
he called it therefore his duty to step forward and       endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself
if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace       him
he had been some days in town before he was able to       discover them but he had something to direct his search which       was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another       reason for his resolving to follow us
there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago       governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on       some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what
she       then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since       maintained herself by letting lodgings
this mrs younge was he       knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for       intelligence of him as soon as he got to town
but it was two or       three days before he could get from her what he wanted
she would       not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption       for she really did know where her friend was to be found
wickham       indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had       she been able to receive them into her house they would have       taken up their abode with her
at length however our kind       friend procured the wishedfor direction
they were in  street
he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia
his       first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her       to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her       friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her       offering his assistance as far as it would go
but he found       lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was
she cared       for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not       hear of leaving wickham
she was sure they should be married some       time or other and it did not much signify when
since such were       her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and       expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with       wickham he easily learnt had never been his design
he       confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of       some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not       to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own       folly alone
he meant to resign his commission immediately and       as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about       it
he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew       he should have nothing to live on
mr
darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have       been able to do something for him and his situation must have       been benefited by marriage
but he found in reply to this       question that wickham still cherished the hope of more       effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country
under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof       against the temptation of immediate relief
they met several times for there was much to be discussed
wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length       was reduced to be reasonable
everything being settled between them mr darcys next step       was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in       gracechurch street the evening before i came home
but mr       gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further       enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town       the next morning
he did not judge your father to be a person       whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore       readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the       former
he did not leave his name and till the next day it was       only known that a gentleman had called on business
on saturday he came again
your father was gone your uncle at       home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk       together
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too
it was not       all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was       sent off to longbourn
but our visitor was very obstinate
i       fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character       after all
he has been accused of many faults at different times       but this is the true one
nothing was to be done that he did       not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be       thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most       readily have settled the whole
they battled it together for a long time which was more than       either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved
but at       last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed       to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having       the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain       and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great       pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him       of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due
but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at       most
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the       young people
his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to       considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in       addition to her own settled upon her and his commission       purchased
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone       was such as i have given above
it was owing to him to his       reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams       character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had       been received and noticed as he was
perhaps there was some truth       in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys       reserve can be answerable for the event
but in spite of all       this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured       that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him       credit for another interest in the affair
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends       who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he       should be in london once more when the wedding took place and       all money matters were then to receive the last finish
i believe i have now told you every thing
it is a relation       which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least       it will not afford you any displeasure
lydia came to us and       wickham had constant admission to the house
he was exactly       what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would       not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour       while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter       last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a       piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no       fresh pain
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious       manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had       done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family
if       she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not       listen
i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my       dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with       her
mr
darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you       attended the wedding
he dined with us the next day and was to       leave town again on wednesday or thursday
will you be very angry       with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying       what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him
his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as       when we were in derbyshire
his understanding and opinions all       please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and       that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him
i       thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name
but       slyness seems the fashion
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do       not punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be       quite happy till i have been all round the park
a low phaeton       with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing
but i must write no more
the children have been wanting me this       half hour
yours very sincerely       m
gardiner        the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of       spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure       or pain bore the greatest share
the vague and unsettled       suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might       have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had       feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be       probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain       of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be       true
he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on       himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a       research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman       whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to       meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe       the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name       it was punishment to him to pronounce
he had done all this for a       girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem
her heart did       whisper that he had done it for her
but it was a hope shortly       checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her       vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection       for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to       overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against       relationship with wickham
brotherinlaw of wickham
every kind       of pride must revolt from the connection
he had to be sure       done much
she was ashamed to think how much
but he had given a       reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch       of belief
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been       wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it       and though she would not place herself as his principal       inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality       for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of       mind must be materially concerned
it was painful exceedingly       painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who       could never receive a return
they owed the restoration of lydia       her character every thing to him
oh
how heartily did she       grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged       every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him
for herself       she was humbled but she was proud of him
proud that in a cause       of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of       himself
she read over her aunts commendation of him again and       again
it was hardly enough but it pleased her
she was even       sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding       how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that       affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself
she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones       approach and before she could strike into another path she was       overtaken by wickham
i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister       said he as he joined her
you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not       follow that the interruption must be unwelcome        i should be sorry indeed if it were
we were always good       friends and now we are better        true
are the others coming out        i do not know
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage       to meryton
and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and       aunt that you have actually seen pemberley        she replied in the affirmative
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be       too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle
and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose
poor reynolds she       was always very fond of me
but of course she did not mention my       name to you        yes she did        and what did she say        that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot       turned out well
at such a distance as that you know things       are strangely misrepresented        certainly he replied biting his lips
elizabeth hoped she had       silenced him but he soon afterwards said        i was surprised to see darcy in town last month
we passed each       other several times
i wonder what he can be doing there        perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said       elizabeth
it must be something particular to take him there at       this time of year        undoubtedly
did you see him while you were at lambton
i       thought i understood from the gardiners that you had        yes he introduced us to his sister        and do you like her        very much        i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within       this year or two
when i last saw her she was not very       promising
i am very glad you liked her
i hope she will turn out       well        i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age        did you go by the village of kympton        i do not recollect that we did        i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have       had
a most delightful placeexcellent parsonage house
it would       have suited me in every respect        how should you have liked making sermons        exceedingly well
i should have considered it as part of my       duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing
one ought       not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing       for me
the quiet the retirement of such a life would have       answered all my ideas of happiness
but it was not to be
did you       ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent        i have heard from authority which i thought as good that       it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the       present patron        you have
yes there was something in that i told you so from       the first you may remember        i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was       not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you       actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and       that the business had been compromised accordingly        you did
and it was not wholly without foundation
you may       remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of       it        they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked       fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to       provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile        come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know
do not       let us quarrel about the past
in future i hope we shall be       always of one mind        she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry       though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house
chapter         mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation       that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear       sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was       pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet       was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no       means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle       was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth
oh
my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again        oh lord
i dont know
not these two or three years perhaps        write to me very often my dear        as often as i can
but you know married women have never much       time for writing
my sisters may write to me
they will have       nothing else to do        mr wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes
he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were       out of the house as ever i saw
he simpers and smirks and       makes love to us all
i am prodigiously proud of him
i defy even       sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw        the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several       days
i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as       parting with ones friends
one seems so forlorn without them        this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a       daughter said elizabeth
it must make you better satisfied       that your other four are single        it is no such thing
lydia does not leave me because she is       married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so       far off
if that had been nearer she would not have gone so       soon        but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was       shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of       hope by an article of news which then began to be in       circulation
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders       to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in       a day or two to shoot there for several weeks
mrs bennet was       quite in the fidgets
she looked at jane and smiled and shook       her head by turns
well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for       mrs phillips first brought her the news
well so much the       better
not that i care about it though
he is nothing to us       you know and i am sure i never want to see him again
but       however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes       it
and who knows what may happen
but that is nothing to us
you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word       about it
and so is it quite certain he is coming        you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was       in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself       on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was       certain true
he comes down on thursday at the latest very       likely on wednesday
she was going to the butchers she told me       on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got       three couple of ducks just fit to be killed        miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without       changing colour
it was many months since she had mentioned his       name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together       she said        i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the       present report and i know i appeared distressed
but dont       imagine it was from any silly cause
i was only confused for the       moment because i felt that i should be looked at
i do assure       you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or       pain
i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we       shall see the less of him
not that i am afraid of myself but       i dread other peoples remarks        elizabeth did not know what to make of it
had she not seen him       in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming       there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she       still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the       greater probability of his coming there with his friends       permission or being bold enough to come without it
yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man       cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without       raising all this speculation
i will leave him to himself        in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be       her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could       easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it
they were       more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their       parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again
as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet       you will wait on him of course        no no
you forced me into visiting him last year and promised       if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters
but it       ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand       again        his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an       attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his       returning to netherfield
tis an etiquette i despise said he
if he wants our       society let him seek it
he knows where we live
i will not       spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they       go away and come back again        well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do       not wait on him
but however that shant prevent my asking him       to dine here i am determined
we must have mrs long and the       gouldings soon
that will make thirteen with ourselves so there       will be just room at table for him        consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her       husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that       her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it       before they did
as the day of his arrival drew near        i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her       sister
it would be nothing i could see him with perfect       indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually       talked of
my mother means well but she does not know no one       can know how much i suffer from what she says
happy shall i be       when his stay at netherfield is over        i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth       but it is wholly out of my power
you must feel it and the       usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied       me because you have always so much        mr bingley arrived
mrs bennet through the assistance of       servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the       period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as       it could
she counted the days that must intervene before their       invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before
but on       the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw       him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride       towards the house
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy
jane       resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy       her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr darcy with       him and sat down again by her sister
there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it       be        some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do       not know        la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be       with him before
mr whatshisname
that tall proud man        good gracious
mr darcyand so it does i vow
well any       friend of mr bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure       but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him        jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern
she knew but       little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the       awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost       for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter
both       sisters were uncomfortable enough
each felt for the other and       of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her       dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only       as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either of them
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be       suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew       mrs gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment       towards him
to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she       had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own       more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole       family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she       regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at       least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley
her       astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to       longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to       what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in       derbyshire
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half       a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added       lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that       his affection and wishes must still be unshaken
but she would       not be secure
let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be       early enough for expectation        she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without       daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them       to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the       door
jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than       elizabeth had expected
on the gentlemens appearing her colour       increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a       propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of       resentment or any unnecessary complaisance
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and       sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not       often command
she had ventured only one glance at darcy
he       looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been       used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at       pemberley
but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be       what he was before her uncle and aunt
it was a painful but not       an improbable conjecture
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short       period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed
he was       received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her       two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold       and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his       friend
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the       latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from       irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful       degree by a distinction so ill applied
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a       question which she could not answer without confusion said       scarcely anything
he was not seated by her perhaps that was the       reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire
there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself
but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his       voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of       curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found       him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object       but the ground
more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please       than when they last met were plainly expressed
she was       disappointed and angry with herself for being so
could i expect it to be otherwise said she
yet why did he       come        she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself       and to him she had hardly courage to speak
she enquired after his sister but could do no more
it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs       bennet
he readily agreed to it
i began to be afraid you would never come back again
people       did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas       but however i hope it is not true
a great many changes have       happened in the neighbourhood since you went away
miss lucas is       married and settled
and one of my own daughters
i suppose you       have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers
it       was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put       in as it ought to be
it was only said lately george wickham       esq
to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said       of her father or the place where she lived or anything
it was       my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to       make such an awkward business of it
did you see it        bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes
how mr darcy looked       therefore she could not tell
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well       married continued her mother but at the same time mr       bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me
they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it       seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long
his       regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving       the shire and of his being gone into the regulars
thank       heaven
he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he       deserves        elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such       misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat
it drew       from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else       had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he       meant to make any stay in the country at present
a few weeks he       believed
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her       mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you       please on mr bennets manor
i am sure he will be vastly happy       to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you        elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious       attention
were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had       flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would       be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion
at that instant       she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself       amends for moments of such painful confusion
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more       to be in company with either of them
their society can afford no       pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this
let me       never see either one or the other again        yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no       compensation received soon afterwards material relief from       observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the       admiration of her former lover
when first he came in he had       spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be       giving her more of his attention
he found her as handsome as she       had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though       not quite so chatty
jane was anxious that no difference should       be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she       talked as much as ever
but her mind was so busily engaged that       she did not always know when she was silent
when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of       her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine       at longbourn in a few days time
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for       when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family       dinner with us as soon as you returned
i have not forgot you       see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did       not come back and keep your engagement        bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said       something of his concern at having been prevented by business
they then went away
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and       dine there that day but though she always kept a very good       table she did not think anything less than two courses could be       good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or       satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a       year
chapter         as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her       spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on       those subjects that must deaden them more
mr darcys behaviour       astonished and vexed her
why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said       she did he come at all        she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt       when he was in town and why not to me
if he fears me why come       hither
if he no longer cares for me why silent
teasing       teasing man
i will think no more about him        her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the       approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look       which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than       elizabeth
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel       perfectly easy
i know my own strength and i shall never be       embarrassed again by his coming
i am glad he dines here on       tuesday
it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we       meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance        yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly
oh       jane take care        my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger       now        i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in       love with you as ever        they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs       bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy       schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley       in half an hours visit had revived
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and       the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their       punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time
when they       repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see       whether bingley would take the place which in all their former       parties had belonged to him by her sister
her prudent mother       occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by       herself
on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane       happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided
he       placed himself by her
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his       friend
he bore it with noble indifference and she would have       imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had       she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an       expression of halflaughing alarm
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as       showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than       formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself       janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured
though       she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received       pleasure from observing his behaviour
it gave her all the       animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no       cheerful humour
mr darcy was almost as far from her as the       table could divide them
he was on one side of her mother
she       knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either       or make either appear to advantage
she was not near enough to       hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they       spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner       whenever they did
her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of       what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she       would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him       that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of       the family
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity       of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not       pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of       conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his       entrance
anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the       drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull       to a degree that almost made her uncivil
she looked forward to       their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure       for the evening must depend
if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him       up for ever        the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have       answered her hopes but alas
the ladies had crowded round the       table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring       out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a       single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair
and on the       gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her       than ever and said in a whisper        the men shant come and part us i am determined
we want none       of them do we        darcy had walked away to another part of the room
she followed       him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely       patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged       against herself for being so silly
a man who has once been refused
how could i ever be foolish       enough to expect a renewal of his love
is there one among the       sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second       proposal to the same woman
there is no indignity so abhorrent to       their feelings        she was a little revived however by his bringing back his       coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying        is your sister at pemberley still        yes she will remain there till christmas        and quite alone
have all her friends left her        mrs
annesley is with her
the others have been gone on to       scarborough these three weeks        she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to       converse with her he might have better success
he stood by her       however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young       ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away
when the teathings were removed and the cardtables placed the       ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined       by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a       victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few       moments after seated with the rest of the party
she now lost       every expectation of pleasure
they were confined for the evening       at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his       eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to       make him play as unsuccessfully as herself
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to       supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of       the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves       what say you to the day
i think every thing has passed off       uncommonly well i assure you
the dinner was as well dressed as       any i ever saw
the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody       said they never saw so fat a haunch
the soup was fifty times       better than what we had at the lucases last week and even mr       darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well       done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty
mrs       long said so too for i asked her whether you did not
and what       do you think she said besides
ah
mrs bennet we shall have       her at netherfield at last she did indeed
i do think mrs long       is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very       pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them       prodigiously        mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen       enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she       would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her       family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that       she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next       day to make his proposals
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to       elizabeth
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one       with the other
i hope we may often meet again        elizabeth smiled
lizzy you must not do so
you must not suspect me
it mortifies       me
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation       as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish       beyond it
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now       are that he never had any design of engaging my affection
it is       only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a       stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man        you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me       smile and are provoking me to it every moment        how hard it is in some cases to be believed        and how impossible in others        but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i       acknowledge        that is a question which i hardly know how to answer
we all       love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth       knowing
forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not       make me your confidante     chapter         a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to       return home in ten days time
he sat with them above an hour and       was in remarkably good spirits
mrs bennet invited him to dine       with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed       himself engaged elsewhere
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky        he should be particularly happy at any time etc
etc
 and if       she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of       waiting on them
can you come tomorrow        yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her       invitation was accepted with alacrity
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of       them dressed
in ran mrs bennet to her daughters room in her       dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out        my dear jane make haste and hurry down
he is comemr
bingley       is come
he is indeed
make haste make haste
here sarah come       to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown
never       mind miss lizzys hair        we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say       kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half       an hour ago        oh
hang kitty
what has she to do with it
come be quick be       quick
where is your sash my dear        but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to       go down without one of her sisters
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in       the evening
after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was       his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument
two       obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking       and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time       without making any impression on them
elizabeth would not       observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently       said what is the matter mamma
what do you keep winking at me       for
what am i to do        nothing child nothing
i did not wink at you she then sat       still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious       occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here       my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room
jane       instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at       such premeditation and her entreaty that she would not give in       to it
in a few minutes mrs bennet halfopened the door and       called out        lizzy my dear i want to speak with you        elizabeth was forced to go
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her       mother as soon as she was in the hall
kitty and i are going up       stairs to sit in my dressingroom        elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained       quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then       returned into the drawingroom
mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual
bingley was       every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her       daughter
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable       addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged       officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with       a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to       the daughter
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he       went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and       mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with       her husband
after this day jane said no more of her indifference
not a word       passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went       to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded       unless mr darcy returned within the stated time
seriously       however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have       taken place with that gentlemans concurrence
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet       spent the morning together as had been agreed on
the latter was       much more agreeable than his companion expected
there was       nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his       ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more       communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen       him
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the       evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get every       body away from him and her daughter
elizabeth who had a letter       to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon       after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards       she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes
but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was       finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to       fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her
on opening       the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together       over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had       this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily       turned round and moved away from each other would have told it       all
their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought       was still worse
not a syllable was uttered by either and       elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who       as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering       a few words to her sister ran out of the room
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence       would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged       with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in       the world
tis too much she added by far too much
i do not deserve       it
oh
why is not everybody as happy        elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a       warmth a delight which words could but poorly express
every       sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane
but       she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half       that remained to be said for the present
i must go instantly to my mother she cried
i would not on       any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her       to hear it from anyone but myself
he is gone to my father       already
oh
lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give       such pleasure to all my dear family
how shall i bear so much       happiness        she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up       the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity       and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given       them so many previous months of suspense and vexation
and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious       circumspection
of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance
the happiest wisest most reasonable end        in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with       her father had been short and to the purpose
where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door
with my mother up stairs
she will be down in a moment i dare       say        he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good       wishes and affection of a sister
elizabeth honestly and heartily       expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship
they       shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came       down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own       happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a       lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity       to be rationally founded because they had for basis the       excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane       and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and       himself
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the       satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet       animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever
kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon
mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation       in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked       to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet       joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how       really happy he was
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till       their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was       gone he turned to his daughter and said        jane i congratulate you
you will be a very happy woman        jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his       goodness
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in       thinking you will be so happily settled
i have not a doubt of       your doing very well together
your tempers are by no means       unlike
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever       be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and       so generous that you will always exceed your income        i hope not so
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters       would be unpardonable in me        exceed their income
my dear mr bennet cried his wife what       are you talking of
why he has four or five thousand a year and       very likely more then addressing her daughter oh
my dear       dear jane i am so happy
i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep       all night
i knew how it would be
i always said it must be so       at last
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing
i       remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into       hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you       should come together
oh
he is the handsomest young man that       ever was seen        wickham lydia were all forgotten
jane was beyond competition       her favourite child
at that moment she cared for no other
her       younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects       of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and       kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at       longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always       remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous       neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an       invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her       sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow       on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both       of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth       for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone       jane constantly sought the same means of relief
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me       that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring
i       had not believed it possible        i suspected as much replied elizabeth
but how did he account       for it        it must have been his sisters doing
they were certainly no       friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at       since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many       respects
but when they see as i trust they will that their       brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we       shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once       were to each other        that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i       ever heard you utter
good girl
it would vex me indeed to see       you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard        would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last       november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of       my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down       again        he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of       his modesty        this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his       diffidence and the little value he put on his own good       qualities
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed       the interference of his friend for though jane had the most       generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a       circumstance which must prejudice her against him
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed       cried jane
oh
lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and       blessed above them all
if i could but see you as happy
if there       were but such another man for you        if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy       as you
till i have your disposition your goodness i never can       have your happiness
no no let me shift for myself and       perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr       collins in time        the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be       long a secret
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs       phillips and she ventured without any permission to do the       same by all her neighbours in meryton
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in       the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first       run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for       misfortune
chapter         one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane       had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting       together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn       to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a       chaise and four driving up the lawn
it was too early in the       morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to       that of any of their neighbours
the horses were post and       neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded       it were familiar to them
as it was certain however that       somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet       to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with       him into the shrubbery
they both set off and the conjectures of       the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction       till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered
it was       lady catherine de bourgh
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their       astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of       mrs bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them       even inferior to what elizabeth felt
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious       made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight       inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships       entrance though no request of introduction had been made
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of       such high importance received her with the utmost politeness
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to       elizabeth        i hope you are well miss bennet
that lady i suppose is your       mother        elizabeth replied very concisely that she was
and that i suppose is one of your sisters        yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to lady       catherine
she is my youngest girl but one
my youngest of all       is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds       walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part       of the family        you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after       a short silence
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but       i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucass        this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening       in summer the windows are full west        mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner       and then added        may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left       mr and mrs collins well        yes very well
i saw them the night before last        elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her       from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her       calling
but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take       some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not       very politely declined eating anything and then rising up       said to elizabeth        miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little       wilderness on one side of your lawn
i should be glad to take a       turn in it if you will favour me with your company        go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the       different walks
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage        elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol       attended her noble guest downstairs
as they passed through the       hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and       drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be       decent looking rooms walked on
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her       waitingwoman was in it
they proceeded in silence along the       gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to       make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more       than usually insolent and disagreeable
how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she       looked in her face
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the       following manner        you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of       my journey hither
your own heart your own conscience must tell       you why i come        elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment
indeed you are mistaken madam
i have not been at all able to       account for the honour of seeing you here        miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought       to know that i am not to be trifled with
but however insincere       you may choose to be you shall not find me so
my character       has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in       a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from       it
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago
i       was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most       advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet       would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew       my own nephew mr darcy
though i know it must be a scandalous       falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose       the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for       this place that i might make my sentiments known to you        if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth       colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the       trouble of coming so far
what could your ladyship propose by       it        at once to insist upon having such a report universally       contradicted        your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said       elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if       indeed such a report is in existence        if
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it
has it not been       industriously circulated by yourselves
do you not know that such       a report is spread abroad        i never heard that it was        and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for       it        i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer        this is not to be borne
miss bennet i insist on being       satisfied
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage        your ladyship has declared it to be impossible        it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of       his reason
but your arts and allurements may in a moment of       infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to       all his family
you may have drawn him in        if i have i shall be the last person to confess it        miss bennet do you know who i am
i have not been accustomed to       such language as this
i am almost the nearest relation he has in       the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns        but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour       as this ever induce me to be explicit        let me be rightly understood
this match to which you have the       presumption to aspire can never take place
no never
mr darcy       is engaged to my daughter
now what have you to say        only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose       he will make an offer to me        lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied        the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind
from their       infancy they have been intended for each other
it was the       favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers
while in       their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when       the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their       marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of       no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family
do       you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends
to his tacit       engagement with miss de bourgh
are you lost to every feeling of       propriety and delicacy
have you not heard me say that from his       earliest hours he was destined for his cousin        yes and i had heard it before
but what is that to me
if there       is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall       certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt       wished him to marry miss de bourgh
you both did as much as you       could in planning the marriage
its completion depended on       others
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination       confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice
and       if i am that choice why may not i accept him        because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it
yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by       his family or friends if you wilfully act against the       inclinations of all
you will be censured slighted and       despised by everyone connected with him
your alliance will be a       disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us        these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth
but the wife       of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness       necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the       whole have no cause to repine        obstinate headstrong girl
i am ashamed of you
is this your       gratitude for my attentions to you last spring
is nothing due to       me on that score
let us sit down
you are to understand miss       bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of       carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it
i have not       been used to submit to any persons whims
i have not been in the       habit of brooking disappointment        that will make your ladyships situation at present more       pitiable but it will have no effect on me        i will not be interrupted
hear me in silence
my daughter and       my nephew are formed for each other
they are descended on the       maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers       from respectable honourable and ancientthough       untitledfamilies
their fortune on both sides is splendid
they       are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their       respective houses and what is to divide them
the upstart       pretensions of a young woman without family connections or       fortune
is this to be endured
but it must not shall not be
if       you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit       the sphere in which you have been brought up        in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as       quitting that sphere
he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans       daughter so far we are equal        true
you are a gentlemans daughter
but who was your mother
who are your uncles and aunts
do not imagine me ignorant of       their condition        whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew       does not object to them they can be nothing to you        tell me once for all are you engaged to him        though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady       catherine have answered this question she could not but say       after a moments deliberation        i am not        lady catherine seemed pleased
and will you promise me never to enter into such an       engagement        i will make no promise of the kind        miss bennet i am shocked and astonished
i expected to find a       more reasonable young woman
but do not deceive yourself into a       belief that i will ever recede
i shall not go away till you have       given me the assurance i require        and i certainly never shall give it
i am not to be       intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable
your ladyship       wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you       the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more       probable
supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing       to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which       you have supported this extraordinary application have been as       frivolous as the application was illjudged
you have widely       mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such       persuasions as these
how far your nephew might approve of your       interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have       certainly no right to concern yourself in mine
i must beg       therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject        not so hasty if you please
i have by no means done
to all the       objections i have already urged i have still another to add
i       am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters       infamous elopement
i know it all that the young mans marrying       her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and       uncles
and is such a girl to be my nephews sister
is her       husband who is the son of his late fathers steward to be his       brother
heaven and earthof what are you thinking
are the       shades of pemberley to be thus polluted        you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully       answered
you have insulted me in every possible method
i must       beg to return to the house        and she rose as she spoke
lady catherine rose also and they       turned back
her ladyship was highly incensed
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my       nephew
unfeeling selfish girl
do you not consider that a       connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody        lady catherine i have nothing further to say
you know my       sentiments        you are then resolved to have him        i have said no such thing
i am only resolved to act in that       manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness       without reference to you or to any person so wholly       unconnected with me        it is well
you refuse then to oblige me
you refuse to obey       the claims of duty honour and gratitude
you are determined to       ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the       contempt of the world        neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth       have any possible claim on me in the present instance
no       principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr       darcy
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the       indignation of the world if the former were excited by his       marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the       world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn        and this is your real opinion
this is your final resolve
very       well
i shall now know how to act
do not imagine miss bennet       that your ambition will ever be gratified
i came to try you
i       hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry       my point        in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the       door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i       take no leave of you miss bennet
i send no compliments to your       mother
you deserve no such attention
i am most seriously       displeased        elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her       ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it       herself
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up       stairs
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the       dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again       and rest herself
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go        she is a very finelooking woman
and her calling here was       prodigiously civil
for she only came i suppose to tell us the       collinses were well
she is on her road somewhere i dare say       and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call       on you
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you       lizzy        elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to       acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible
chapter         the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw       elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for       many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly
lady       catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this       journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her       supposed engagement with mr darcy
it was a rational scheme to       be sure
but from what the report of their engagement could       originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she       recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and       her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the       expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to       supply the idea
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the       marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their       communication with the collinses the report she concluded had       reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost       certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as       possible at some future time
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not       help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of       her persisting in this interference
from what she had said of       her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to       elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew       and how he might take a similar representation of the evils       attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce
she       knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his       dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he       thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it       was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with       one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own       his aunt would address him on his weakest side
with his notions       of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to       elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good       sense and solid reasoning
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had       often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a       relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to       be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him
in that case       he would return no more
lady catherine might see him in her way       through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to       netherfield must give way
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come       to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to       understand it
i shall then give over every expectation every       wish of his constancy
if he is satisfied with only regretting       me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall       soon cease to regret him at all        the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their       visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied       it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs       bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on       the subject
the next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her       father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my       room        she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had       to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in       some manner connected with the letter he held
it suddenly struck       her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated       with dismay all the consequent explanations
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat       down
he then said        i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me       exceedingly
as it principally concerns yourself you ought to       know its contents
i did not know before that i had two       daughters on the brink of matrimony
let me congratulate you on a       very important conquest        the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the       instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew       instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be       pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his       letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father       continued        you look conscious
young ladies have great penetration in such       matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to       discover the name of your admirer
this letter is from mr       collins        from mr collins
and what can he have to say        something very much to the purpose of course
he begins with       congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest       daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the       goodnatured gossiping lucases
i shall not sport with your       impatience by reading what he says on that point
what relates       to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere       congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event       let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which       we have been advertised by the same authority
your daughter       elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet       after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of       her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most       illustrious personages in this land        can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this
this young       gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the       heart of mortal can most desiresplendid property noble       kindred and extensive patronage
yet in spite of all these       temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of       what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this       gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to       take immediate advantage of        have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is
but now it       comes out        my motive for cautioning you is as follows
we have reason to       imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on       the match with a friendly eye        mr
darcy you see is the man
now lizzy i think i have       surprised you
could he or the lucases have pitched on any man       within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have       given the lie more effectually to what they related
mr darcy       who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who       probably never looked at you in his life
it is admirable        elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could       only force one most reluctant smile
never had his wit been       directed in a manner so little agreeable to her
are you not diverted        oh
yes
pray read on        after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her       ladyship last night she immediately with her usual       condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it       became apparent that on the score of some family objections on       the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what       she termed so disgraceful a match
i thought it my duty to give       the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her       noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run       hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned       mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin       lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only       concerned that their living together before the marriage took       place should be so generally known
i must not however neglect       the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement       at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as       soon as they were married
it was an encouragement of vice and       had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously       have opposed it
you ought certainly to forgive them as a       christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their       names to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of       christian forgiveness
the rest of his letter is only about his       dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young       olivebranch
but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it
you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be       affronted at an idle report
for what do we live but to make       sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn        oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted
but it is so       strange        yesthat is what makes it amusing
had they fixed on any other       man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference       and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd
much       as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collinss       correspondence for any consideration
nay when i read a letter       of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over       wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my       soninlaw
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this       report
did she call to refuse her consent        to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as       it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not       distressed by his repeating it
elizabeth had never been more at       a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not
it was       necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried
her father       had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darcys       indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want       of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too       little she might have fancied too much
chapter         instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend       as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to       bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed       after lady catherines visit
the gentlemen arrived early and       before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his       aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who       wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out
it       was agreed to
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary       could never spare time but the remaining five set off together
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip       them
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were       to entertain each other
very little was said by either kitty       was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly       forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the       same
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call       upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a       general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him       alone
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and       while her courage was high she immediately said        mr
darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of       giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be       wounding yours
i can no longer help thanking you for your       unexampled kindness to my poor sister
ever since i have known       it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully       i feel it
were it known to the rest of my family i should not       have merely my own gratitude to express        i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of       surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what       may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness
i did not       think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted        you must not blame my aunt
lydias thoughtlessness first       betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of       course i could not rest till i knew the particulars
let me       thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that       generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble       and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering       them        if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself       alone
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force       to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to       deny
but your family owe me nothing
much as i respect them i       believe i thought only of you        elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word
after a short       pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with       me
if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me       so at once
my affections and wishes are unchanged but one       word from you will silence me on this subject for ever        elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and       anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and       immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand       that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the       period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude       and pleasure his present assurances
the happiness which this       reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before       and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as       warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do
had       elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how       well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face       became him but though she could not look she could listen and       he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she       was to him made his affection every moment more valuable
they walked on without knowing in what direction
there was too       much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any       other objects
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their       present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did       call on him in her return through london and there relate her       journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her       conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every       expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension       peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief       that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that       promise from her nephew which she had refused to give
but       unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly       contrariwise
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed       myself to hope before
i knew enough of your disposition to be       certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided       against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine       frankly and openly        elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know       enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that
after       abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple       in abusing you to all your relations        what did you say of me that i did not deserve
for though your       accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my       behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof
it       was unpardonable
i cannot think of it without abhorrence        we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to       that evening said elizabeth
the conduct of neither if       strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we       have both i hope improved in civility        i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself
the recollection of       what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions       during the whole of it is now and has been many months       inexpressibly painful to me
your reproof so well applied i       shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike       manner those were your words
you know not you can scarcely       conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i       confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice        i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong       an impression
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever       felt in such a way        i can easily believe it
you thought me then devoid of every       proper feeling i am sure you did
the turn of your countenance i       shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed       you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me        oh
do not repeat what i then said
these recollections will not       do at all
i assure you that i have long been most heartily       ashamed of it        darcy mentioned his letter
did it said he did it soon make       you think better of me
did you on reading it give any credit       to its contents        she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually       all her former prejudices had been removed
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it       was necessary
i hope you have destroyed the letter
there was       one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your       having the power of reading again
i can remember some       expressions which might justly make you hate me        the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential       to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason       to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i       hope quite so easily changed as that implies        when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself       perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was       written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit        the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so
the adieu is charity itself
but think no more of the letter
the       feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it       are now so widely different from what they were then that every       unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten
you       must learn some of my philosophy
think only of the past as its       remembrance gives you pleasure        i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind
your       retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the       contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is       much better of innocence
but with me it is not so
painful       recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be       repelled
i have been a selfish being all my life in practice       though not in principle
as a child i was taught what was       right but i was not taught to correct my temper
i was given       good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was       spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father       particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed       encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to       care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all       the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of       their sense and worth compared with my own
such i was from       eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but       for you dearest loveliest elizabeth
what do i not owe you
you       taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous
by you i was properly humbled
i came to you without a doubt of       my reception
you showed me how insufficient were all my       pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased        had you then persuaded yourself that i should        indeed i had
what will you think of my vanity
i believed you       to be wishing expecting my addresses        my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i       assure you
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might       often lead me wrong
how you must have hated me after that       evening        hate you
i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began       to take a proper direction        i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met       at pemberley
you blamed me for coming        no indeed i felt nothing but surprise        your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed       by you
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary       politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more       than my due        my object then replied darcy was to show you by every       civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the       past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill       opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended       to
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly       tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you        he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and       of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally       leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that       his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her       sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his       gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other       struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a       subject to each to be dwelt on farther
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy       to know anything about it they found at last on examining their       watches that it was time to be at home
what could become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which       introduced the discussion of their affairs
darcy was delighted       with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest       information of it
i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth
not at all
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen        that is to say you had given your permission
i guessed as       much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had       been pretty much the case
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a       confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former       interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent
his surprise       was great
he had never had the slightest suspicion
i told him       moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had       done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could       easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt       no doubt of their happiness together        elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing       his friend
did you speak from your own observation said she when you       told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information       last spring        from the former
i had narrowly observed her during the two       visits which i had lately made here and i was convinced of her       affection        and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate       conviction to him        it did
bingley is most unaffectedly modest
his diffidence had       prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case       but his reliance on mine made every thing easy
i was obliged to       confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended       him
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had       been in town three months last winter that i had known it and       purposely kept it from him
he was angry
but his anger i am       persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your       sisters sentiments
he has heartily forgiven me now        elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most       delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was       invaluable but she checked herself
she remembered that he had       yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to       begin
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course       was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation       till they reached the house
in the hall they parted
chapter         my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a       question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she       entered their room and from all the others when they sat down to       table
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered       about till she was beyond her own knowledge
she coloured as she       spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion       of the truth
the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged       were silent
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness       overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather       knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for       besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils       before her
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when       her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him       but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike       which not all his fortune and consequence might do away
at night she opened her heart to jane
though suspicion was very       far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely       incredulous here
you are joking lizzy
this cannot beengaged to mr darcy
no       no you shall not deceive me
i know it to be impossible        this is a wretched beginning indeed
my sole dependence was on       you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not
yet indeed i am in earnest
i speak nothing but the truth
he       still loves me and we are engaged        jane looked at her doubtingly
oh lizzy
it cannot be
i know       how much you dislike him        you know nothing of the matter
that is all to be forgot
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now
but in       such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable
this is the       last time i shall ever remember it myself        miss bennet still looked all amazement
elizabeth again and more       seriously assured her of its truth
good heaven
can it be really so
yet now i must believe you       cried jane
my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate       youbut are you certain
forgive the questionare you quite       certain that you can be happy with him        there can be no doubt of that
it is settled between us already       that we are to be the happiest couple in the world
but are you       pleased jane
shall you like to have such a brother        very very much
nothing could give either bingley or myself       more delight
but we considered it we talked of it as       impossible
and do you really love him quite well enough
oh       lizzy
do anything rather than marry without affection
are you       quite sure that you feel what you ought to do        oh yes
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do       when i tell you all        what do you mean        why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley
i       am afraid you will be angry        my dearest sister now be serious
i want to talk very       seriously
let me know every thing that i am to know without       delay
will you tell me how long you have loved him        it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it       began
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his       beautiful grounds at pemberley        another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the       desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn       assurances of attachment
when convinced on that article miss       bennet had nothing further to wish
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as       myself
i always had a value for him
were it for nothing but his       love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as       bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and       yourself more dear to me
but lizzy you have been very sly very       reserved with me
how little did you tell me of what passed at       pemberley and lambton
i owe all that i know of it to another       not to you        elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy
she had been       unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own       feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend
but       now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias       marriage
all was acknowledged and half the night spent in       conversation
good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the       next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here       again with our dear bingley
what can he mean by being so       tiresome as to be always coming here
i had no notion but he       would go ashooting or something or other and not disturb us       with his company
what shall we do with him
lizzy you must walk       out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way        elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal       yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him       such an epithet
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively       and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good       information and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs
bennet       have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way       again today        i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to       walk to oakham mount this morning
it is a nice long walk and       mr darcy has never seen the view        it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i       am sure it will be too much for kitty
wont it kitty kitty       owned that she had rather stay at home
darcy professed a great       curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently       consented
as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet       followed her saying        i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that       disagreeable man all to yourself
but i hope you will not mind       it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion       for talking to him except just now and then
so do not put       yourself to inconvenience        during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent       should be asked in the course of the evening
elizabeth reserved       to herself the application for her mothers
she could not       determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting       whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome       her abhorrence of the man
but whether she were violently set       against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain       that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her       sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the       first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her       disapprobation
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library       she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on       seeing it was extreme
she did not fear her fathers opposition       but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be       through her meansthat she his favourite child should be       distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears       and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched reflection and       she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at       him she was a little relieved by his smile
in a few minutes he       approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while       pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your       father he wants you in the library she was gone directly
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious
lizzy said he what are you doing
are you out of your       senses to be accepting this man
have not you always hated him        how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been       more reasonable her expressions more moderate
it would have       spared her from explanations and professions which it was       exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she       assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy
or in other words you are determined to have him
he is rich       to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages       than jane
but will they make you happy        have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief       of my indifference        none at all
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of       man but this would be nothing if you really liked him        i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i       love him
indeed he has no improper pride
he is perfectly       amiable
you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain       me by speaking of him in such terms        lizzy said her father i have given him my consent
he is the       kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything       which he condescended to ask
i now give it to you if you are       resolved on having him
but let me advise you to think better of       it
i know your disposition lizzy
i know that you could be       neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your       husband unless you looked up to him as a superior
your lively       talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal       marriage
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery
my       child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to       respect your partner in life
you know not what you are about        elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her       reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was       really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change       which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute       certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had       stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with       energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers       incredulity and reconcile him to the match
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no       more to say
if this be the case he deserves you
i could not       have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less worthy        to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr       darcy had voluntarily done for lydia
he heard her with       astonishment
this is an evening of wonders indeed
and so darcy did every       thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows       debts and got him his commission
so much the better
it will       save me a world of trouble and economy
had it been your uncles       doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young       lovers carry every thing their own way
i shall offer to pay him       tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and       there will be an end of the matter        he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his       reading mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some       time allowed her at last to gosaying as she quitted the room       if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am       quite at leisure        elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and       after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was       able to join the others with tolerable composure
every thing was       too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away       there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the       comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she       followed her and made the important communication
its effect       was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat       quite still and unable to utter a syllable
nor was it under       many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard       though not in general backward to credit what was for the       advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to       any of them
she began at length to recover to fidget about in       her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself
good gracious
lord bless me
only think
dear me
mr darcy
who would have thought it
and is it really true
oh
my sweetest       lizzy
how rich and how great you will be
what pinmoney what       jewels what carriages you will have
janes is nothing to       itnothing at all
i am so pleasedso happy
such a charming       manso handsome
so talloh my dear lizzy
pray apologise for       my having disliked him so much before
i hope he will overlook       it
dear dear lizzy
a house in town
every thing that is       charming
three daughters married
ten thousand a year
oh lord
what will become of me
i shall go distracted        this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be       doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard       only by herself soon went away
but before she had been three       minutes in her own room her mother followed her
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else
ten       thousand a year and very likely more
tis as good as a lord
and a special licence
you must and shall be married by a special       licence
but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is       particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow        this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the       gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in       the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of       her relations consent there was still something to be wished       for
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for       mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw       that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power       to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his       opinion
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains       to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that       he was rising every hour in his esteem
i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he
wickham       perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband       quite as well as janes     chapter         elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted       mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her
how could you begin said she
i can comprehend your going on       charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could       set you off in the first place        i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the       words which laid the foundation
it is too long ago
i was in       the middle before i knew that i had begun        my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy       behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil       and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain       than not
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence        for the liveliness of your mind i did        you may as well call it impertinence at once
it was very little       less
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference       of officious attention
you were disgusted with the women who       were always speaking and looking and thinking for your       approbation alone
i roused and interested you because i was so       unlike them
had you not been really amiable you would have       hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise       yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your       heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously       courted you
therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for       it and really all things considered i begin to think it       perfectly reasonable
to be sure you knew no actual good of       mebut nobody thinks of that when they fall in love        was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while       she was ill at netherfield        dearest jane
who could have done less for her
but make a       virtue of it by all means
my good qualities are under your       protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible       and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing       and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin       directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the       point at last
what made you so shy of me when you first called       and afterwards dined here
why especially when you called did       you look as if you did not care about me        because you were grave and silent and gave me no       encouragement        but i was embarrassed        and so was i        you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner        a man who had felt less might        how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give       and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it
but i wonder       how long you would have gone on if you had been left to       yourself
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not       asked you
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to       lydia had certainly great effect
too much i am afraid for       what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach       of promise
for i ought not to have mentioned the subject
this       will never do        you need not distress yourself
the moral will be perfectly       fair
lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us       were the means of removing all my doubts
i am not indebted for       my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your       gratitude
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of       yours
my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was       determined at once to know every thing        lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her       happy for she loves to be of use
but tell me what did you come       down to netherfield for
was it merely to ride to longbourn and       be embarrassed
or had you intended any more serious       consequence        my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could       whether i might ever hope to make you love me
my avowed one or       what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were       still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession       to him which i have since made        shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what       is to befall her        i am more likely to want  time than courage elizabeth
but it       ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it       shall be done directly        and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you       and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady       once did
but i have an aunt too who must not be longer       neglected        from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr       darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs       gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate       which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to       find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of       happiness and immediately wrote as follows        i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to       have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of       particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write
you       supposed more than really existed
but now suppose as much as       you choose give a loose rein to your fancy indulge your       imagination in every possible flight which the subject will       afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot       greatly err
you must write again very soon and praise him a       great deal more than you did in your last
i thank you again and       again for not going to the lakes
how could i be so silly as to       wish it
your idea of the ponies is delightful
we will go round       the park every day
i am the happiest creature in the world
perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such       justice
i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare       from me
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas
yours       etc        mr darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style       and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr       collins in reply to his last
dear sir       i must trouble you once more for congratulations
elizabeth will       soon be the wife of mr darcy
console lady catherine as well as       you can
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew
he has       more to give
yours sincerely etc        miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching       marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere
she wrote       even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat       all her former professions of regard
jane was not deceived but       she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could       not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was       deserved
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar       information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it
four       sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and       all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any       congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family       heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge
the       reason of this sudden removal was soon evident
lady catherine       had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her       nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match       was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over
at such a       moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to       elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must       sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr       darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her       husband
he bore it however with admirable calmness
he could       even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on       carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed       his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st jamess with       very decent composure
if he did shrug his shoulders it was not       till sir william was out of sight
mrs phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax       on his forbearance and though mrs phillips as well as her       sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the       familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever       she did speak she must be vulgar
nor was her respect for him       though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more       elegant
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the       frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to       herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse       without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings       arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of       its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked       forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from       society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and       elegance of their family party at pemberley
chapter         happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs       bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters
with what       delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked       of mrs darcy may be guessed
i wish i could say for the sake       of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in       the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an       effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman       for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her       husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so       unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and       invariably silly
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection       for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least       expected
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not       desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an       estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and       elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were       within thirty miles of each other
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her       time with her two elder sisters
in society so superior to what       she had generally known her improvement was great
she was not       of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the       influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and       management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid
from       the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course       carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to       come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men       her father would never consent to her going
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was       necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs       bennets being quite unable to sit alone
mary was obliged to mix       more with the world but she could still moralize over every       morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons       between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her       father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution       from the marriage of her sisters
he bore with philosophy the       conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with       whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown       to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope       that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune
the       congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her       marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by       himself such a hope was cherished
the letter was to this       effect        my dear lizzy       i wish you joy
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my       dear wickham you must be very happy
it is a great comfort to       have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope       you will think of us
i am sure wickham would like a place at       court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money       enough to live upon without some help
any place would do of       about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to       mr darcy about it if you had rather not
yours etc        as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she       endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and       expectation of the kind
such relief however as it was in her       power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy       in her own private expences she frequently sent them
it had       always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under       the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and       heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their       support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or       herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance       towards discharging their bills
their manner of living even       when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was       unsettled in the extreme
they were always moving from place to       place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more       than they ought
his affection for her soon sunk into       indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her       youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation       which her marriage had given her
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for       elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone       to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they       both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good       humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of       giving them a hint to be gone
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but       as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at       pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of       georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid       off every arrear of civility to elizabeth
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the       sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see
they were able       to love each other even as well as they intended
georgiana had       the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first       she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her       lively sportive manner of talking to her brother
he who had       always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her       affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry
her mind       received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way
by       elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman       may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not       always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than       himself
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her       nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her       character in her reply to the letter which announced its       arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of       elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end
but       at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to       overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a       little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment       gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to       see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait       on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods       had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress       but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were       both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons       who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of       uniting them
