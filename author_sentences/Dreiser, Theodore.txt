the magnet attracting a waif amid forces when caroline meeber boarded the afternoon train for chicago her total outfit consisted of a small trunk a cheap imitation alligatorskin satchel a small lunch in a paper box and a yellow leather snap purse containing her ticket a scrap of paper with her sisters address in van buren street and four dollars in money
it was in august
she was eighteen years of age bright timid and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth
whatever touch of regret at parting characterised her thoughts it was certainly not for advantages now being given up
a gush of tears at her mothers farewell kiss a touch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flour mill where her father worked by the day a pathetic sigh as the familiar green environs of the village passed in review and the threads which bound her so lightly to girlhood and home were irretrievably broken
to be sure there was always the next station where one might descend and return
there was the great city bound more closely by these very trains which came up daily
columbia city was not so very far away even once she was in chicago
what pray is a few hoursa few hundred miles
she looked at the little slip bearing her sisters address and wondered
she gazed at the green landscape now passing in swift review until her swifter thoughts replaced its impression with vague conjectures of what chicago might be
when a girl leaves her home at eighteen she does one of two things
either she falls into saving hands and becomes better or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse
of an intermediate balance under the circumstances there is no possibility
the city has its cunning wiles no less than the infinitely smaller and more human tempter
there are large forces which allure with all the soulfulness of expression possible in the most cultured human
the gleam of a thousand lights is often as effective as the persuasive light in a wooing and fascinating eye
half the undoing of the unsophisticated and natural mind is accomplished by forces wholly superhuman
a blare of sound a roar of life a vast array of human hives appeal to the astonished senses in equivocal terms
without a counsellor at hand to whisper cautious interpretations what falsehoods may not these things breathe into the unguarded ear
unrecognised for what they are their beauty like music too often relaxes then weakens then perverts the simpler human perceptions
caroline or sister carrie as she had been half affectionately termed by the family was possessed of a mind rudimentary in its power of observation and analysis
selfinterest with her was high but not strong
it was nevertheless her guiding characteristic
warm with the fancies of youth pretty with the insipid prettiness of the formative period possessed of a figure promising eventual shapeliness and an eye alight with certain native intelligence she was a fair example of the middle american classtwo generations removed from the emigrant
books were beyond her interestknowledge a sealed book
in the intuitive graces she was still crude
she could scarcely toss her head gracefully
her hands were almost ineffectual
the feet though small were set flatly
and yet she was interested in her charms quick to understand the keener pleasures of life ambitious to gain in material things
a halfequipped little knight she was venturing to reconnoitre the mysterious city and dreaming wild dreams of some vague faroff supremacy which should make it prey and subjectthe proper penitent grovelling at a womans slipper
that said a voice in her ear is one of the prettiest little resorts in wisconsin is it she answered nervously
the train was just pulling out of waukesha
for some time she had been conscious of a man behind
she felt him observing her mass of hair
he had been fidgetting and with natural intuition she felt a certain interest growing in that quarter
her maidenly reserve and a certain sense of what was conventional under the circumstances called her to forestall and deny this familiarity but the daring and magnetism of the individual born of past experiences and triumphs prevailed
she answered
he leaned forward to put his elbows upon the back of her seat and proceeded to make himself volubly agreeable
yes that is a great resort for chicago people
the hotels are swell
you are not familiar with this part of the country are you oh yes i am answered carrie
that is i live at columbia city
i have never been through here though and so this is your first visit to chicago he observed
all the time she was conscious of certain features out of the side of her eye
flush colourful cheeks a light moustache a grey fedora hat
she now turned and looked upon him in full the instincts of selfprotection and coquetry mingling confusedly in her brain
i didnt say that she said
oh he answered in a very pleasing way and with an assumed air of mistake i thought you did here was a type of the travelling canvasser for a manufacturing housea class which at that time was first being dubbed by the slang of the day drummers he came within the meaning of a still newer term which had sprung into general use among americans in and which concisely expressed the thought of one whose dress or manners are calculated to elicit the admiration of susceptible young womena masher his suit was of a striped and crossed pattern of brown wool new at that time but since become familiar as a business suit
the low crotch of the vest revealed a stiff shirt bosom of white and pink stripes
from his coat sleeves protruded a pair of linen cuffs of the same pattern fastened with large gold plate buttons set with the common yellow agates known as catseyes his fingers bore several ringsone the everenduring heavy sealand from his vest dangled a neat gold watch chain from which was suspended the secret insignia of the order of elks
the whole suit was rather tightfitting and was finished off with heavysoled tan shoes highly polished and the grey fedora hat
he was for the order of intellect represented attractive and whatever he had to recommend him you may be sure was not lost upon carrie in this her first glance
lest this order of individual should permanently pass let me put down some of the most striking characteristics of his most successful manner and method
good clothes of course were the first essential the things without which he was nothing
a strong physical nature actuated by a keen desire for the feminine was the next
a mind free of any consideration of the problems or forces of the world and actuated not by greed but an insatiable love of variable pleasure
his method was always simple
its principal element was daring backed of course by an intense desire and admiration for the sex
let him meet with a young woman once and he would approach her with an air of kindly familiarity not unmixed with pleading which would result in most cases in a tolerant acceptance
if she showed any tendency to coquetry he would be apt to straighten her tie or if she took up with him at all to call her by her first name
if he visited a department store it was to lounge familiarly over the counter and ask some leading questions
in more exclusive circles on the train or in waiting stations he went slower
if some seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attentionto pass the compliments of the day to lead the way to the parlor car carrying her grip or failing that to take a seat next her with the hope of being able to court her to her destination
pillows books a footstool the shade lowered all these figured in the things which he could do
if when she reached her destination he did not alight and attend her baggage for her it was because in his own estimation he had signally failed
a woman should some day write the complete philosophy of clothes
no matter how young it is one of the things she wholly comprehends
there is an indescribably faint line in the matter of mans apparel which somehow divides for her those who are worth glancing at and those who are not
once an individual has passed this faint line on the way downward he will get no glance from her
there is another line at which the dress of a man will cause her to study her own
this line the individual at her elbow now marked for carrie
she became conscious of an inequality
her own plain blue dress with its black cotton tape trimmings now seemed to her shabby
she felt the worn state of her shoes
lets see he went on i know quite a number of people in your town
morgenroth the clothier and gibson the dry goods man oh do you she interrupted aroused by memories of longings their show windows had cost her
at last he had a clew to her interest and followed it deftly
in a few minutes he had come about into her seat
he talked of sales of clothing his travels chicago and the amusements of that city
if you are going there you will enjoy it immensely
have you relatives i am going to visit my sister she explained
you want to see lincoln park he said and michigan boulevard
they are putting up great buildings there
its a second new yorkgreat
so much to seetheatres crowds fine housesoh youll like that there was a little ache in her fancy of all he described
her insignificance in the presence of so much magnificence faintly affected her
she realised that hers was not to be a round of pleasure and yet there was something promising in all the material prospect he set forth
there was something satisfactory in the attention of this individual with his good clothes
she could not help smiling as he told her of some popular actress of whom she reminded him
she was not silly and yet attention of this sort had its weight
you will be in chicago some little time wont you he observed at one turn of the now easy conversation
i dont know said carrie vaguelya flash vision of the possibility of her not securing employment rising in her mind
several weeks anyhow he said looking steadily into her eyes
there was much more passing now than the mere words indicated
he recognised the indescribable thing that made up for fascination and beauty in her
she realised that she was of interest to him from the one standpoint which a woman both delights in and fears
her manner was simple though for the very reason that she had not yet learned the many little affectations with which women conceal their true feelings
some things she did appeared bold
a clever companionhad she ever had onewould have warned her never to look a man in the eyes so steadily
why do you ask she said
well im going to be there several weeks
im going to study stock at our place and get new samples
i might show you round i dont know whether you can or not
i mean i dont know whether i can
i shall be living with my sister and well if she minds well fix that he took out his pencil and a little pocket notebook as if it were all settled
what is your address there she fumbled her purse which contained the address slip
he reached down in his hip pocket and took out a fat purse
it was filled with slips of paper some mileage books a roll of greenbacks
it impressed her deeply
such a purse had never been carried by any one attentive to her
indeed an experienced traveller a brisk man of the world had never come within such close range before
the purse the shiny tan shoes the smart new suit and the air with which he did things built up for her a dim world of fortune of which he was the centre
it disposed her pleasantly toward all he might do
he took out a neat business card on which was engraved bartlett caryoe company and down in the lefthand corner chas
h drouet
thats me he said putting the card in her hand and touching his name
its pronounced dreweh
our family was french on my fathers side she looked at it while he put up his purse
then he got out a letter from a bunch in his coat pocket
this is the house i travel for he went on pointing to a picture on it corner of state and lake there was pride in his voice
he felt that it was something to be connected with such a place and he made her feel that way
what is your address he began again fixing his pencil to write
she looked at his hand
carrie meeber she said slowly
three hundred and fiftyfour west van buren street care s c hanson he wrote it carefully down and got out the purse again
youll be at home if i come around monday night he said
i think so she answered
how true it is that words are but the vague shadows of the volumes we mean
little audible links they are chaining together great inaudible feelings and purposes
here were these two bandying little phrases drawing purses looking at cards and both unconscious of how inarticulate all their real feelings were
neither was wise enough to be sure of the working of the mind of the other
he could not tell how his luring succeeded
she could not realise that she was drifting until he secured her address
now she felt that she had yielded somethinghe that he had gained a victory
already they felt that they were somehow associated
already he took control in directing the conversation
his words were easy
her manner was relaxed
they were nearing chicago
signs were everywhere numerous
trains flashed by them
across wide stretches of flat open prairie they could see lines of telegraph poles stalking across the fields toward the great city
far away were indications of suburban towns some big smokestacks towering high in the air
frequently there were twostory frame houses standing out in the open fields without fence or trees lone outposts of the approaching army of homes
to the child the genius with imagination or the wholly untravelled the approach to a great city for the first time is a wonderful thing
particularly if it be eveningthat mystic period between the glare and gloom of the world when life is changing from one sphere or condition to another
ah the promise of the night
what does it not hold for the weary
what old illusion of hope is not here forever repeated
says the soul of the toiler to itself i shall soon be free
i shall be in the ways and the hosts of the merry
the streets the lamps the lighted chamber set for dining are for me
the theatre the halls the parties the ways of rest and the paths of songthese are mine in the night though all humanity be still enclosed in the shops the thrill runs abroad
it is in the air
the dullest feel something which they may not always express or describe
it is the lifting of the burden of toil
sister carrie gazed out of the window
her companion affected by her wonder so contagious are all things felt anew some interest in the city and pointed out its marvels
this is northwest chicago said drouet
this is the chicago river and he pointed to a little muddy creek crowded with the huge masted wanderers from faroff waters nosing the blackposted banks
with a puff a clang and a clatter of rails it was gone
chicago is getting to be a great town he went on
its a wonder
youll find lots to see here she did not hear this very well
her heart was troubled by a kind of terror
the fact that she was alone away from home rushing into a great sea of life and endeavour began to tell
she could not help but feel a little choked for breatha little sick as her heart beat so fast
she half closed her eyes and tried to think it was nothing that columbia city was only a little way off
chicago
chicago called the brakeman slamming open the door
they were rushing into a more crowded yard alive with the clatter and clang of life
she began to gather up her poor little grip and closed her hand firmly upon her purse
drouet arose kicked his legs to straighten his trousers and seized his clean yellow grip
i suppose your people will be here to meet you he said
let me carry your grip oh no she said
id rather you wouldnt
id rather you wouldnt be with me when i meet my sister all right he said in all kindness
ill be near though in case she isnt here and take you out there safely youre so kind said carrie feeling the goodness of such attention in her strange situation
chicago called the brakeman drawing the word out long
they were under a great shadowy train shed where the lamps were already beginning to shine out with passenger cars all about and the train moving at a snails pace
the people in the car were all up and crowding about the door
well here we are said drouet leading the way to the door
goodbye till i see you monday goodbye she answered taking his proffered hand
remember ill be looking till you find your sister she smiled into his eyes
they filed out and he affected to take no notice of her
a leanfaced rather commonplace woman recognised carrie on the platform and hurried forward
why sister carrie she began and there was embrace of welcome
carrie realised the change of affectional atmosphere at once
amid all the maze uproar and novelty she felt cold reality taking her by the hand
no world of light and merriment
no round of amusement
her sister carried with her most of the grimness of shift and toil
why how are all the folks at home she began how is father and mother carrie answered but was looking away
down the aisle toward the gate leading into the waitingroom and the street stood drouet
he was looking back
when he saw that she saw him and was safe with her sister he turned to go sending back the shadow of a smile
only carrie saw it
she felt something lost to her when he moved away
when he disappeared she felt his absence thoroughly
with her sister she was much alone a lone figure in a tossing thoughtless sea
chapter ii
what poverty threatened of granite and brass minnies flat as the onefloor resident apartments were then being called was in a part of west van buren street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks men who had come and were still coming with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of a year
it was on the third floor the front windows looking down into the street where at night the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing
to carrie the sound of the little bells upon the horsecars as they tinkled in and out of hearing was as pleasing as it was novel
she gazed into the lighted street when minnie brought her into the front room and wondered at the sounds the movement the murmur of the vast city which stretched for miles and miles in every direction
mrs hanson after the first greetings were over gave carrie the baby and proceeded to get supper
her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper
he was a silent man american born of a swede father and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at the stockyards
to him the presence or absence of his wifes sister was a matter of indifference
her personal appearance did not affect him one way or the other
his one observation to the point was concerning the chances of work in chicago
its a big place he said
you can get in somewhere in a few days
everybody does it had been tacitly understood beforehand that she was to get work and pay her board
he was of a clean saving disposition and had already paid a number of monthly instalments on two lots far out on the west side
his ambition was some day to build a house on them
in the interval which marked the preparation of the meal carrie found time to study the flat
she had some slight gift of observation and that sense so rich in every womanintuition
she felt the drag of a lean and narrow life
the walls of the rooms were discordantly papered
the floors were covered with matting and the hall laid with a thin rag carpet
one could see that the furniture was of that poor hurriedly patched together quality sold by the instalment houses
she sat with minnie in the kitchen holding the baby until it began to cry
then she walked and sang to it until hanson disturbed in his reading came and took it
a pleasant side to his nature came out here
he was patient
one could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring
now now he said walking
there there and there was a certain swedish accent noticeable in his voice
youll want to see the city first wont you said minnie when they were eating
well well go out sunday and see lincoln park carrie noticed that hanson had said nothing to this
he seemed to be thinking of something else
well she said i think ill look around tomorrow
ive got friday and saturday and it wont be any trouble
which way is the business part minnie began to explain but her husband took this part of the conversation to himself
its that way he said pointing east
thats east then he went off into the longest speech he had yet indulged in concerning the lay of chicago
youd better look in those big manufacturing houses along franklin street and just the other side of the river he concluded
lots of girls work there
you could get home easy too
it isnt very far carrie nodded and asked her sister about the neighbourhood
the latter talked in a subdued tone telling the little she knew about it while hanson concerned himself with the baby
finally he jumped up and handed the child to his wife
ive got to get up early in the morning so ill go to bed and off he went disappearing into the dark little bedroom off the hall for the night
he works way down at the stockyards explained minnie so hes got to get up at halfpast five what time do you get up to get breakfast asked carrie
at about twenty minutes of five together they finished the labour of the day carrie washing the dishes while minnie undressed the baby and put it to bed
minnies manner was one of trained industry and carrie could see that it was a steady round of toil with her
she began to see that her relations with drouet would have to be abandoned
he could not come here
she read from the manner of hanson in the subdued air of minnie and indeed the whole atmosphere of the flat a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round of toil
if hanson sat every evening in the front room and read his paper if he went to bed at nine and minnie a little later what would they expect of her
she saw that she would first need to get work and establish herself on a paying basis before she could think of having company of any sort
her little flirtation with drouet seemed now an extraordinary thing
no she said to herself he cant come here she asked minnie for ink and paper which were upon the mantel in the diningroom and when the latter had gone to bed at ten got out drouets card and wrote him
i cannot have you call on me here
you will have to wait until you hear from me again
my sisters place is so small she troubled herself over what else to put in the letter
she wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train but was too timid
she concluded by thanking him for his kindness in a crude way then puzzled over the formality of signing her name and finally decided upon the severe winding up with a very truly which she subsequently changed to sincerely she scaled and addressed the letter and going in the front room the alcove of which contained her bed drew the one small rockingchair up to the open window and sat looking out upon the night and streets in silent wonder
finally wearied by her own reflections she began to grow dull in her chair and feeling the need of sleep arranged her clothing for the night and went to bed
when she awoke at eight the next morning hanson had gone
her sister was busy in the diningroom which was also the sittingroom sewing
she worked after dressing to arrange a little breakfast for herself and then advised with minnie as to which way to look
the latter had changed considerably since carrie had seen her
she was now a thin though rugged woman of twentyseven with ideas of life coloured by her husbands and fast hardening into narrower conceptions of pleasure and duty than had ever been hers in a thoroughly circumscribed youth
she had invited carrie not because she longed for her presence but because the latter was dissatisfied at home and could probably get work and pay her board here
she was pleased to see her in a way but reflected her husbands point of view in the matter of work
anything was good enough so long as it paidsay five dollars a week to begin with
a shop girl was the destiny prefigured for the newcomer
she would get in one of the great shops and do well enough untilwell until something happened
neither of them knew exactly what
they did not figure on promotion
they did not exactly count on marriage
things would go on though in a dim kind of way until the better thing would eventuate and carrie would be rewarded for coming and toiling in the city
it was under such auspicious circumstances that she started out this morning to look for work
before following her in her round of seeking let us look at the sphere in which her future was to lie
in chicago had the peculiar qualifications of growth which made such adventuresome pilgrimages even on the part of young girls plausible
its many and growing commercial opportunities gave it widespread fame which made of it a giant magnet drawing to itself from all quarters the hopeful and the hopelessthose who had their fortune yet to make and those whose fortunes and affairs had reached a disastrous climax elsewhere
it was a city of over with the ambition the daring the activity of a metropolis of a million
its streets and houses were already scattered over an area of seventyfive square miles
its population was not so much thriving upon established commerce as upon the industries which prepared for the arrival of others
the sound of the hammer engaged upon the erection of new structures was everywhere heard
great industries were moving in
the huge railroad corporations which had long before recognised the prospects of the place had seized upon vast tracts of land for transfer and shipping purposes
streetcar lines had been extended far out into the open country in anticipation of rapid growth
the city had laid miles and miles of streets and sewers through regions where perhaps one solitary house stood out alonea pioneer of the populous ways to be
there were regions open to the sweeping winds and rain which were yet lighted throughout the night with long blinking lines of gaslamps fluttering in the wind
narrow board walks extended out passing here a house and there a store at far intervals eventually ending on the open prairie
in the central portion was the vast wholesale and shopping district to which the uninformed seeker for work usually drifted
it was a characteristic of chicago then and one not generally shared by other cities that individual firms of any pretension occupied individual buildings
the presence of ample ground made this possible
it gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street
the large plates of window glass now so common were then rapidly coming into use and gave to the ground floor offices a distinguished and prosperous look
the casual wanderer could see as he passed a polished array of office fixtures much frosted glass clerks hard at work and genteel businessmen in nobby suits and clean linen lounging about or sitting in groups
polished brass or nickel signs at the square stone entrances announced the firm and the nature of the business in rather neat and reserved terms
the entire metropolitan centre possessed a high and mighty air calculated to overawe and abash the common applicant and to make the gulf between poverty and success seem both wide and deep
into this important commercial region the timid carrie went
she walked east along van buren street through a region of lessening importance until it deteriorated into a mass of shanties and coalyards and finally verged upon the river
she walked bravely forward led by an honest desire to find employment and delayed at every step by the interest of the unfolding scene and a sense of helplessness amid so much evidence of power and force which she did not understand
these vast buildings what were they
these strange energies and huge interests for what purposes were they there
she could have understood the meaning of a little stonecutters yard at columbia city carving little pieces of marble for individual use but when the yards of some huge stone corporation came into view filled with spur tracks and flat cars transpierced by docks from the river and traversed overhead by immense trundling cranes of wood and steel it lost all significance in her little world
it was so with the vast railroad yards with the crowded array of vessels she saw at the river and the huge factories over the way lining the waters edge
through the open windows she could see the figures of men and women in working aprons moving busily about
the great streets were walllined mysteries to her the vast offices strange mazes which concerned faroff individuals of importance
she could only think of people connected with them as counting money dressing magnificently and riding in carriages
what they dealt in how they laboured to what end it all came she had only the vaguest conception
it was all wonderful all vast all far removed and she sank in spirit inwardly and fluttered feebly at the heart as she thought of entering any one of these mighty concerns and asking for something to dosomething that she could doanything
chapter iii
wee question of fortune fourfifty a week once across the river and into the wholesale district she glanced about her for some likely door at which to apply
as she contemplated the wide windows and imposing signs she became conscious of being gazed upon and understood for what she wasa wageseeker
she had never done this thing before and lacked courage
to avoid a certain indefinable shame she felt at being caught spying about for a position she quickened her steps and assumed an air of indifference supposedly common to one upon an errand
in this way she passed many manufacturing and wholesale houses without once glancing in
at last after several blocks of walking she felt that this would not do and began to look about again though without relaxing her pace
a little way on she saw a great door which for some reason attracted her attention
it was ornamented by a small brass sign and seemed to be the entrance to a vast hive of six or seven floors
perhaps she thought they may want some one and crossed over to enter
when she came within a score of feet of the desired goal she saw through the window a young man in a grey checked suit
that he had anything to do with the concern she could not tell but because he happened to be looking in her direction her weakening heart misgave her and she hurried by too overcome with shame to enter
over the way stood a great sixstory structure labelled storm and king which she viewed with rising hope
it was a wholesale dry goods concern and employed women
she could see them moving about now and then upon the upper floors
this place she decided to enter no matter what
she crossed over and walked directly toward the entrance
as she did so two men came out and paused in the door
a telegraph messenger in blue dashed past her and up the few steps that led to the entrance and disappeared
several pedestrians out of the hurrying throng which filled the sidewalks passed about her as she paused hesitating
she looked helplessly around and then seeing herself observed retreated
it was too difficult a task
she could not go past them
so severe a defeat told sadly upon her nerves
her feet carried her mechanically forward every foot of her progress being a satisfactory portion of a flight which she gladly made
block after block passed by
upon streetlamps at the various corners she read names such as madison monroe la salle clark dearborn state and still she went her feet beginning to tire upon the broad stone flagging
she was pleased in part that the streets were bright and clean
the morning sun shining down with steadily increasing warmth made the shady side of the streets pleasantly cool
she looked at the blue sky overhead with more realisation of its charm than had ever come to her before
her cowardice began to trouble her in a way
she turned back resolving to hunt up storm and king and enter
on the way she encountered a great wholesale shoe company through the broad plate windows of which she saw an enclosed executive department hidden by frosted glass
without this enclosure but just within the street entrance sat a greyhaired gentleman at a small table with a large open ledger before him
she walked by this institution several times hesitating but finding herself unobserved faltered past the screen door and stood humbly waiting
well young lady observed the old gentleman looking at her somewhat kindly what is it you wish i am that is do youi mean do you need any help she stammered
not just at present he answered smiling
not just at present
come in some time next week
occasionally we need some one she received the answer in silence and backed awkwardly out
the pleasant nature of her reception rather astonished her
she had expected that it would be more difficult that something cold and harsh would be saidshe knew not what
that she had not been put to shame and made to feel her unfortunate position seemed remarkable
somewhat encouraged she ventured into another large structure
it was a clothing company and more people were in evidencewelldressed men of forty and more surrounded by brass railings
an office boy approached her
who is it you wish to see he asked
i want to see the manager she said
he ran away and spoke to one of a group of three men who were conferring together
one of these came towards her
well he said coldly
the greeting drove all courage from her at once
do you need any help she stammered
no he replied abruptly and turned upon his heel
she went foolishly out the office boy deferentially swinging the door for her and gladly sank into the obscuring crowd
it was a severe setback to her recently pleased mental state
now she walked quite aimlessly for a time turning here and there seeing one great company after another but finding no courage to prosecute her single inquiry
high noon came and with it hunger
she hunted out an unassuming restaurant and entered but was disturbed to find that the prices were exorbitant for the size of her purse
a bowl of soup was all that she could afford and with this quickly eaten she went out again
it restored her strength somewhat and made her moderately bold to pursue the search
in walking a few blocks to fix upon some probable place she again encountered the firm of storm and king and this time managed to get in
some gentlemen were conferring close at hand but took no notice of her
she was left standing gazing nervously upon the floor
when the limit of her distress had been nearly reached she was beckoned to by a man at one of the many desks within the nearby railing
who is it you wish to see he required
why any one if you please she answered
i am looking for something to do oh you want to see mr mcmanus he returned
sit down and he pointed to a chair against the neighbouring wall
he went on leisurely writing until after a time a short stout gentleman came in from the street
mr
mcmanus called the man at the desk this young woman wants to see you the short gentleman turned about towards carrie and she arose and came forward
what can i do for you miss he inquired surveying her curiously
i want to know if i can get a position she inquired
as what he asked
not as anything in particular she faltered
have you ever had any experience in the wholesale dry goods business he questioned
no sir she replied
are you a stenographer or typewriter no sir well we havent anything here he said
we employ only experienced help she began to step backward toward the door when something about her plaintive face attracted him
have you ever worked at anything before he inquired
no sir she said
well now its hardly possible that you would get anything to do in a wholesale house of this kind
have you tried the department stores she acknowledged that she had not
well if i were you he said looking at her rather genially i would try the department stores
they often need young women as clerks thank you she said her whole nature relieved by this spark of friendly interest
yes he said as she moved toward the door you try the department stores and off he went
at that time the department store was in its earliest form of successful operation and there were not many
the first three in the united states established about were in chicago
carrie was familiar with the names of several through the advertisements in the daily news and now proceeded to seek them
the words of mr mcmanus had somehow managed to restore her courage which had fallen low and she dared to hope that this new line would offer her something
some time she spent in wandering up and down thinking to encounter the buildings by chance so readily is the mind bent upon prosecuting a hard but needful errand eased by that selfdeception which the semblance of search without the reality gives
at last she inquired of a police officer and was directed to proceed two blocks up where she would find the fair the nature of these vast retail combinations should they ever permanently disappear will form an interesting chapter in the commercial history of our nation
such a flowering out of a modest trade principle the world had never witnessed up to that time
they were along the line of the most effective retail organisation with hundreds of stores coordinated into one and laid out upon the most imposing and economic basis
they were handsome bustling successful affairs with a host of clerks and a swarm of patrons
carrie passed along the busy aisles much affected by the remarkable displays of trinkets dress goods stationery and jewelry
each separate counter was a show place of dazzling interest and attraction
she could not help feeling the claim of each trinket and valuable upon her personally and yet she did not stop
there was nothing there which she could not have usednothing which she did not long to own
the dainty slippers and stockings the delicately frilled skirts and petticoats the laces ribbons haircombs purses all touched her with individual desire and she felt keenly the fact that not any of these things were in the range of her purchase
she was a workseeker an outcast without employment one whom the average employee could tell at a glance was poor and in need of a situation
it must not be thought that any one could have mistaken her for a nervous sensitive highstrung nature cast unduly upon a cold calculating and unpoetic world
such certainly she was not
but women are peculiarly sensitive to their adornment
not only did carrie feel the drag of desire for all which was new and pleasing in apparel for women but she noticed too with a touch at the heart the fine ladies who elbowed and ignored her brushing past in utter disregard of her presence themselves eagerly enlisted in the materials which the store contained
carrie was not familiar with the appearance of her more fortunate sisters of the city
neither had she before known the nature and appearance of the shop girls with whom she now compared poorly
they were pretty in the main some even handsome with an air of independence and indifference which added in the case of the more favoured a certain piquancy
their clothes were neat in many instances fine and wherever she encountered the eye of one it was only to recognise in it a keen analysis of her own positionher individual shortcomings of dress and that shadow of manner which she thought must hang about her and make clear to all who and what she was
a flame of envy lighted in her heart
she realised in a dim way how much the city heldwealth fashion easeevery adornment for women and she longed for dress and beauty with a whole heart
on the second floor were the managerial offices to which after some inquiry she was now directed
there she found other girls ahead of her applicants like herself but with more of that selfsatisfied and independent air which experience of the city lends girls who scrutinised her in a painful manner
after a wait of perhaps threequarters of an hour she was called in turn
now said a sharp quickmannered jew who was sitting at a rolltop desk near the window have you ever worked in any other store no sir said carrie
oh you havent he said eyeing her keenly
no sir she replied
well we prefer young women just now with some experience
i guess we cant use you carrie stood waiting a moment hardly certain whether the interview had terminated
dont wait he exclaimed
remember we are very busy here carrie began to move quickly to the door
hold on he said calling her back
give me your name and address
we want girls occasionally when she had gotten safely into the street she could scarcely restrain the tears
it was not so much the particular rebuff which she had just experienced but the whole abashing trend of the day
she was tired and nervous
she abandoned the thought of appealing to the other department stores and now wandered on feeling a certain safety and relief in mingling with the crowd
in her indifferent wandering she turned into jackson street not far from the river and was keeping her way along the south side of that imposing thoroughfare when a piece of wrapping paper written on with marking ink and tacked up on the door attracted her attention
it read girls wantedwrappers stitchers she hesitated a moment then entered
the firm of speigelheim co makers of boys caps occupied one floor of the building fifty feet in width and some eighty feet in depth
it was a place rather dingily lighted the darkest portions having incandescent lights filled with machines and work benches
at the latter laboured quite a company of girls and some men
the former were drabbylooking creatures stained in face with oil and dust clad in thin shapeless cotton dresses and shod with more or less worn shoes
many of them had their sleeves rolled up revealing bare arms and in some cases owing to the heat their dresses were open at the neck
they were a fair type of nearly the lowest order of shopgirlscareless slouchy and more or less pale from confinement
they were not timid however were rich in curiosity and strong in daring and slang
carrie looked about her very much disturbed and quite sure that she did not want to work here
aside from making her uncomfortable by sidelong glances no one paid her the least attention
she waited until the whole department was aware of her presence
then some word was sent around and a foreman in an apron and shirt sleeves the latter rolled up to his shoulders approached
do you want to see me he asked
do you need any help said carrie already learning directness of address
do you know how to stitch caps he returned
no sir she replied
have you ever had any experience at this kind of work he inquired
she answered that she had not
well said the foreman scratching his ear meditatively we do need a stitcher
we like experienced help though
weve hardly got time to break people in he paused and looked away out of the window
we might though put you at finishing he concluded reflectively
how much do you pay a week ventured carrie emboldened by a certain softness in the mans manner and his simplicity of address
three and a half he answered
oh she was about to exclaim but checked herself and allowed her thoughts to die without expression
were not exactly in need of anybody he went on vaguely looking her over as one would a package
you can come on monday morning though he added and ill put you to work thank you said carrie weakly
if you come bring an apron he added
he walked away and left her standing by the elevator never so much as inquiring her name
while the appearance of the shop and the announcement of the price paid per week operated very much as a blow to carries fancy the fact that work of any kind was offered after so rude a round of experience was gratifying
she could not begin to believe that she would take the place modest as her aspirations were
she had been used to better than that
her mere experience and the free outofdoor life of the country caused her nature to revolt at such confinement
dirt had never been her share
her sisters flat was clean
this place was grimy and low the girls were careless and hardened
they must be badminded and hearted she imagined
still a place had been offered her
surely chicago was not so bad if she could find one place in one day
she might find another and better later
her subsequent experiences were not of a reassuring nature however
from all the more pleasing or imposing places she was turned away abruptly with the most chilling formality
in others where she applied only the experienced were required
she met with painful rebuffs the most trying of which had been in a manufacturing cloak house where she had gone to the fourth floor to inquire
no no said the foreman a rough heavily built individual who looked after a miserably lighted workshop we dont want any one
dont come here with the wane of the afternoon went her hopes her courage and her strength
she had been astonishingly persistent
so earnest an effort was well deserving of a better reward
on every hand to her fatigued senses the great business portion grew larger harder more stolid in its indifference
it seemed as if it was all closed to her that the struggle was too fierce for her to hope to do anything at all
men and women hurried by in long shifting lines
she felt the flow of the tide of effort and interestfelt her own helplessness without quite realising the wisp on the tide that she was
she cast about vainly for some possible place to apply but found no door which she had the courage to enter
it would be the same thing all over
the old humiliation of her plea rewarded by curt denial
sick at heart and in body she turned to the west the direction of minnies flat which she had now fixed in mind and began that wearisome baffled retreat which the seeker for employment at nightfall too often makes
in passing through fifth avenue south towards van buren street where she intended to take a car she passed the door of a large wholesale shoe house through the plateglass windows of which she could see a middleaged gentleman sitting at a small desk
one of those forlorn impulses which often grow out of a fixed sense of defeat the last sprouting of a baffled and uprooted growth of ideas seized upon her
she walked deliberately through the door and up to the gentleman who looked at her weary face with partially awakened interest
what is it he said
can you give me something to do said carrie
now i really dont know he said kindly
what kind of work is it you wantyoure not a typewriter are you oh no answered carrie
well we only employ bookkeepers and typewriters here
you might go around to the side and inquire upstairs
they did want some help upstairs a few days ago
ask for mr brown she hastened around to the side entrance and was taken up by the elevator to the fourth floor
call mr brown willie said the elevator man to a boy near by
willie went off and presently returned with the information that mr brown said she should sit down and that he would be around in a little while
it was a portion of the stock room which gave no idea of the general character of the place and carrie could form no opinion of the nature of the work
so you want something to do said mr brown after he inquired concerning the nature of her errand
have you ever been employed in a shoe factory before no sir said carrie
what is your name he inquired and being informed well i dont know as i have anything for you
would you work for four and a half a week carrie was too worn by defeat not to feel that it was considerable
she had not expected that he would offer her less than six
she acquiesced however and he took her name and address
well he said finally you report here at eight oclock monday morning
i think i can find something for you to do he left her revived by the possibilities sure that she had found something at last
instantly the blood crept warmly over her body
her nervous tension relaxed
she walked out into the busy street and discovered a new atmosphere
behold the throng was moving with a lightsome step
she noticed that men and women were smiling
scraps of conversation and notes of laughter floated to her
the air was light
people were already pouring out of the buildings their labour ended for the day
she noticed that they were pleased and thoughts of her sisters home and the meal that would be awaiting her quickened her steps
she hurried on tired perhaps but no longer weary of foot
what would not minnie say
ah the long winter in chicagothe lights the crowd the amusement
this was a great pleasing metropolis after all
her new firm was a goodly institution
its windows were of huge plate glass
she could probably do well there
thoughts of drouet returnedof the things he had told her
she now felt that life was better that it was livelier sprightlier
she boarded a car in the best of spirits feeling her blood still flowing pleasantly
she would live in chicago her mind kept saying to itself
she would have a better time than she had ever had beforeshe would be happy
chapter iv
the spendings of fancy facts answer with sneers for the next two days carrie indulged in the most highflown speculations
her fancy plunged recklessly into privileges and amusements which would have been much more becoming had she been cradled a child of fortune
with ready will and quick mental selection she scattered her meagre fourfifty per week with a swift and graceful hand
indeed as she sat in her rockingchair these several evenings before going to bed and looked out upon the pleasantly lighted street this money cleared for its prospective possessor the way to every joy and every bauble which the heart of woman may desire
i will have a fine time she thought
her sister minnie knew nothing of these rather wild cerebrations though they exhausted the markets of delight
she was too busy scrubbing the kitchen woodwork and calculating the purchasing power of eighty cents for sundays dinner
when carrie had returned home flushed with her first success and ready for all her weariness to discuss the now interesting events which led up to her achievement the former had merely smiled approvingly and inquired whether she would have to spend any of it for car fare
this consideration had not entered in before and it did not now for long affect the glow of carries enthusiasm
disposed as she then was to calculate upon that vague basis which allows the subtraction of one sum from another without any perceptible diminution she was happy
when hanson came home at seven oclock he was inclined to be a little crustyhis usual demeanour before supper
this never showed so much in anything he said as in a certain solemnity of countenance and the silent manner in which he slopped about
he had a pair of yellow carpet slippers which he enjoyed wearing and these he would immediately substitute for his solid pair of shoes
this and washing his face with the aid of common washing soap until it glowed a shiny red constituted his only preparation for his evening meal
he would then get his evening paper and read in silence
for a young man this was rather a morbid turn of character and so affected carrie
indeed it affected the entire atmosphere of the flat as such things are inclined to do and gave to his wifes mind its subdued and tactful turn anxious to avoid taciturn replies
under the influence of carries announcement he brightened up somewhat
you didnt lose any time did you he remarked smiling a little
no returned carrie with a touch of pride
he asked her one or two more questions and then turned to play with the baby leaving the subject until it was brought up again by minnie at the table
carrie however was not to be reduced to the common level of observation which prevailed in the flat
it seems to be such a large company she said at one place
great big plateglass windows and lots of clerks
the man i saw said they hired ever so many people its not very hard to get work now put in hanson if you look right minnie under the warming influence of carries good spirits and her husbands somewhat conversational mood began to tell carrie of some of the wellknown things to seethings the enjoyment of which cost nothing
youd like to see michigan avenue
there are such fine houses
it is such a fine street where is h r jacobs interrupted carrie mentioning one of the theatres devoted to melodrama which went by that name at the time
oh its not very far from here answered minnie
its in halstead street right up here how id like to go there
i crossed halstead street today didnt i at this there was a slight halt in the natural reply
thoughts are a strangely permeating factor
at her suggestion of going to the theatre the unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing of those things which involved the expenditure of moneyshades of feeling which arose in the mind of hanson and then in minnieslightly affected the atmosphere of the table
minnie answered yes but carrie could feel that going to the theatre was poorly advocated here
the subject was put off for a little while until hanson through with his meal took his paper and went into the front room
when they were alone the two sisters began a somewhat freer conversation carrie interrupting it to hum a little as they worked at the dishes
i should like to walk up and see halstead street if it isnt too far said carrie after a time
why dont we go to the theatre tonight oh i dont think sven would want to go tonight returned minnie
he has to get up so early he wouldnt mindhed enjoy it said carrie
no he doesnt go very often returned minnie
well id like to go rejoined carrie
lets you and me go minnie pondered a while not upon whether she could or would gofor that point was already negatively settled with herbut upon some means of diverting the thoughts of her sister to some other topic
well go some other time she said at last finding no ready means of escape
carrie sensed the root of the opposition at once
i have some money she said
you go with me minnie shook her head
he could go along said carrie
no returned minnie softly and rattling the dishes to drown the conversation
he wouldnt it had been several years since minnie had seen carrie and in that time the latters character had developed a few shades
naturally timid in all things that related to her own advancement and especially so when without power or resource her craving for pleasure was so strong that it was the one stay of her nature
she would speak for that when silent on all else
ask him she pleaded softly
minnie was thinking of the resource which carries board would add
it would pay the rent and would make the subject of expenditure a little less difficult to talk about with her husband
but if carrie was going to think of running around in the beginning there would be a hitch somewhere
unless carrie submitted to a solemn round of industry and saw the need of hard work without longing for play how was her coming to the city to profit them
these thoughts were not those of a cold hard nature at all
they were the serious reflections of a mind which invariably adjusted itself without much complaining to such surroundings as its industry could make for it
at last she yielded enough to ask hanson
it was a halfhearted procedure without a shade of desire on her part
carrie wants us to go to the theatre she said looking in upon her husband
hanson looked up from his paper and they exchanged a mild look which said as plainly as anything this isnt what we expected i dont care to go he returned
what does she want to see h
r jacobs said minnie
he looked down at his paper and shook his head negatively
when carrie saw how they looked upon her proposition she gained a still clearer feeling of their way of life
it weighed on her but took no definite form of opposition
i think ill go down and stand at the foot of the stairs she said after a time
minnie made no objection to this and carrie put on her hat and went below
where has carrie gone asked hanson coming back into the diningroom when he heard the door close
she said she was going down to the foot of the stairs answered minnie
i guess she just wants to look out a while she oughtnt to be thinking about spending her money on theatres already do you think he said
she just feels a little curious i guess ventured minnie
everything is so new i dont know said hanson and went over to the baby his forehead slightly wrinkled
he was thinking of a full career of vanity and wastefulness which a young girl might indulge in and wondering how carrie could contemplate such a course when she had so little as yet with which to do
on saturday carrie went out by herselffirst toward the river which interested her and then back along jackson street which was then lined by the pretty houses and fine lawns which subsequently caused it to be made into a boulevard
she was struck with the evidences of wealth although there was perhaps not a person on the street worth more than a hundred thousand dollars
she was glad to be out of the flat because already she felt that it was a narrow humdrum place and that interest and joy lay elsewhere
her thoughts now were of a more liberal character and she punctuated them with speculations as to the whereabouts of drouet
she was not sure but that he might call anyhow monday night and while she felt a little disturbed at the possibility there was nevertheless just the shade of a wish that he would
on monday she arose early and prepared to go to work
she dressed herself in a worn shirtwaist of dotted blue percale a skirt of lightbrown serge rather faded and a small straw hat which she had worn all summer at columbia city
her shoes were old and her necktie was in that crumpled flattened state which time and much wearing impart
she made a very average looking shopgirl with the exception of her features
these were slightly more even than common and gave her a sweet reserved and pleasing appearance
it is no easy thing to get up early in the morning when one is used to sleeping until seven and eight as carrie had been at home
she gained some inkling of the character of hansons life when half asleep she looked out into the diningroom at six oclock and saw him silently finishing his breakfast
by the time she was dressed he was gone and she minnie and the baby ate together the latter being just old enough to sit in a high chair and disturb the dishes with a spoon
her spirits were greatly subdued now when the fact of entering upon strange and untried duties confronted her
only the ashes of all her fine fancies were remainingashes still concealing nevertheless a few red embers of hope
so subdued was she by her weakening nerves that she ate quite in silence going over imaginary conceptions of the character of the shoe company the nature of the work her employers attitude
she was vaguely feeling that she would come in contact with the great owners that her work would be where grave stylishly dressed men occasionally look on
well good luck said minnie when she was ready to go
they had agreed it was best to walk that morning at least to see if she could do it every daysixty cents a week for car fare being quite an item under the circumstances
ill tell you how it goes tonight said carrie
once in the sunlit street with labourers tramping by in either direction the horsecars passing crowded to the rails with the small clerks and floor help in the great wholesale houses and men and women generally coming out of doors and passing about the neighbourhood carrie felt slightly reassured
in the sunshine of the morning beneath the wide blue heavens with a fresh wind astir what fears except the most desperate can find a harbourage
in the night or the gloomy chambers of the day fears and misgivings wax strong but out in the sunlight there is for a time cessation even of the terror of death
carrie went straight forward until she crossed the river and then turned into fifth avenue
the thoroughfare in this part was like a walled canon of brown stone and dark red brick
the big windows looked shiny and clean
trucks were rumbling in increasing numbers men and women girls and boys were moving onward in all directions
she met girls of her own age who looked at her as if with contempt for her diffidence
she wondered at the magnitude of this life and at the importance of knowing much in order to do anything in it at all
dread at her own inefficiency crept upon her
she would not know how she would not be quick enough
had not all the other places refused her because she did not know something or other
she would be scolded abused ignominiously discharged
it was with weak knees and a slight catch in her breathing that she came up to the great shoe company at adams and fifth avenue and entered the elevator
when she stepped out on the fourth floor there was no one at hand only great aisles of boxes piled to the ceiling
she stood very much frightened awaiting some one
presently mr brown came up
he did not seem to recognise her
what is it you want he inquired
carries heart sank
you said i should come this morning to see about work oh he interrupted
umyes
what is your name carrie meeber yes said he
you come with me he led the way through dark boxlined aisles which had the smell of new shoes until they came to an iron door which opened into the factory proper
there was a large lowceiled room with clacking rattling machines at which men in white shirt sleeves and blue gingham aprons were working
she followed him diffidently through the clattering automatons keeping her eyes straight before her and flushing slightly
they crossed to a far corner and took an elevator to the sixth floor
out of the array of machines and benches mr brown signalled a foreman
this is the girl he said and turning to carrie you go with him he then returned and carrie followed her new superior to a little desk in a corner which he used as a kind of official centre
youve never worked at anything like this before have you he questioned rather sternly
no sir she answered
he seemed rather annoyed at having to bother with such help but put down her name and then led her across to where a line of girls occupied stools in front of clacking machines
on the shoulder of one of the girls who was punching eyeholes in one piece of the upper by the aid of the machine he put his hand
you he said show this girl how to do what youre doing
when you get through come to me the girl so addressed rose promptly and gave carrie her place
it isnt hard to do she said bending over
you just take this so fasten it with this clamp and start the machine she suited action to word fastened the piece of leather which was eventually to form the right half of the upper of a mans shoe by little adjustable clamps and pushed a small steel rod at the side of the machine
the latter jumped to the task of punching with sharp snapping clicks cutting circular bits of leather out of the side of the upper leaving the holes which were to hold the laces
after observing a few times the girl let her work at it alone
seeing that it was fairly well done she went away
the pieces of leather came from the girl at the machine to her right and were passed on to the girl at her left
carrie saw at once that an average speed was necessary or the work would pile up on her and all those below would be delayed
she had no time to look about and bent anxiously to her task
the girls at her left and right realised her predicament and feelings and in a way tried to aid her as much as they dared by working slower
at this task she laboured incessantly for some time finding relief from her own nervous fears and imaginings in the humdrum mechanical movement of the machine
she felt as the minutes passed that the room was not very light
it had a thick odour of fresh leather but that did not worry her
she felt the eyes of the other help upon her and troubled lest she was not working fast enough
once when she was fumbling at the little clamp having made a slight error in setting in the leather a great hand appeared before her eyes and fastened the clamp for her
it was the foreman
her heart thumped so that she could scarcely see to go on
start your machine he said start your machine
dont keep the line waiting this recovered her sufficiently and she went excitedly on hardly breathing until the shadow moved away from behind her
then she heaved a great breath
as the morning wore on the room became hotter
she felt the need of a breath of fresh air and a drink of water but did not venture to stir
the stool she sat on was without a back or footrest and she began to feel uncomfortable
she found after a time that her back was beginning to ache
she twisted and turned from one position to another slightly different but it did not ease her for long
she was beginning to weary
stand up why dont you said the girl at her right without any form of introduction
they wont care carrie looked at her gratefully
i guess i will she said
she stood up from her stool and worked that way for a while but it was a more difficult position
her neck and shoulders ached in bending over
the spirit of the place impressed itself on her in a rough way
she did not venture to look around but above the clack of the machine she could hear an occasional remark
she could also note a thing or two out of the side of her eye
did you see harry last night said the girl at her left addressing her neighbour
no you ought to have seen the tie he had on
gee but he was a mark sst said the other girl bending over her work
the first silenced instantly assumed a solemn face
the foreman passed slowly along eyeing each worker distinctly
the moment he was gone the conversation was resumed again
say began the girl at her left what jeh think he said i dont know he said he saw us with eddie harris at martins last night no they both giggled
a youth with tancoloured hair that needed clipping very badly came shuffling along between the machines bearing a basket of leather findings under his left arm and pressed against his stomach
when near carrie he stretched out his right hand and gripped one girl under the arm
aw let me go she exclaimed angrily
duffer he only grinned broadly in return
rubber he called back as she looked after him
there was nothing of the gallant in him
carrie at last could scarcely sit still
her legs began to tire and she wanted to get up and stretch
would noon never come
it seemed as if she had worked an entire day
she was not hungry at all but weak and her eyes were tired straining at the one point where the eyepunch came down
the girl at the right noticed her squirmings and felt sorry for her
she was concentrating herself too thoroughlywhat she did really required less mental and physical strain
there was nothing to be done however
the halves of the uppers came piling steadily down
her hands began to ache at the wrists and then in the fingers and towards the last she seemed one mass of dull complaining muscles fixed in an eternal position and performing a single mechanical movement which became more and more distasteful until as last it was absolutely nauseating
when she was wondering whether the strain would ever cease a dullsounding bell clanged somewhere down an elevator shaft and the end came
in an instant there was a buzz of action and conversation
all the girls instantly left their stools and hurried away in an adjoining room men passed through coming from some department which opened on the right
the whirling wheels began to sing in a steadily modifying key until at last they died away in a low buzz
there was an audible stillness in which the common voice sounded strange
carrie got up and sought her lunch box
she was stiff a little dizzy and very thirsty
on the way to the small space portioned off by wood where all the wraps and lunches were kept she encountered the foreman who stared at her hard
well he said did you get along all right i think so she replied very respectfully
um he replied for want of something better and walked on
under better material conditions this kind of work would not have been so bad but the new socialism which involves pleasant working conditions for employees had not then taken hold upon manufacturing companies
the place smelled of the oil of the machines and the new leathera combination which added to the stale odours of the building was not pleasant even in cold weather
the floor though regularly swept every evening presented a littered surface
not the slightest provision had been made for the comfort of the employees the idea being that something was gained by giving them as little and making the work as hard and unremunerative as possible
what we know of footrests swivelback chairs diningrooms for the girls clean aprons and curling irons supplied free and a decent cloak room were unthought of
the washrooms were disagreeable crude if not foul places and the whole atmosphere was sordid
carrie looked about her after she had drunk a tinful of water from a bucket in one corner for a place to sit and eat
the other girls had ranged themselves about the windows or the workbenches of those of the men who had gone out
she saw no place which did not hold a couple or a group of girls and being too timid to think of intruding herself she sought out her machine and seated upon her stool opened her lunch on her lap
there she sat listening to the chatter and comment about her
it was for the most part silly and graced by the current slang
several of the men in the room exchanged compliments with the girls at long range
say kitty called one to a girl who was doing a waltz step in a few feet of space near one of the windows are you going to the ball with me look out kitty called another youll jar your back hair go on rubber was her only comment
as carrie listened to this and much more of similar familiar badinage among the men and girls she instinctively withdrew into herself
she was not used to this type and felt that there was something hard and low about it all
she feared that the young boys about would address such remarks to herboys who beside drouet seemed uncouth and ridiculous
she made the average feminine distinction between clothes putting worth goodness and distinction in a dress suit and leaving all the unlovely qualities and those beneath notice in overalls and jumper
she was glad when the short half hour was over and the wheels began to whirr again
though wearied she would be inconspicuous
this illusion ended when another young man passed along the aisle and poked her indifferently in the ribs with his thumb
she turned about indignation leaping to her eyes but he had gone on and only once turned to grin
she found it difficult to conquer an inclination to cry
the girl next her noticed her state of mind
dont you mind she said
hes too fresh carrie said nothing but bent over her work
she felt as though she could hardly endure such a life
her idea of work had been so entirely different
all during the long afternoon she thought of the city outside and its imposing show crowds and fine buildings
columbia city and the better side of her home life came back
by three oclock she was sure it must be six and by four it seemed as if they had forgotten to note the hour and were letting all work overtime
the foreman became a true ogre prowling constantly about keeping her tied down to her miserable task
what she heard of the conversation about her only made her feel sure that she did not want to make friends with any of these
when six oclock came she hurried eagerly away her arms aching and her limbs stiff from sitting in one position
as she passed out along the hall after getting her hat a young machine hand attracted by her looks made bold to jest with her
say maggie he called if you wait ill walk with you it was thrown so straight in her direction that she knew who was meant but never turned to look
in the crowded elevator another dusty toilstained youth tried to make an impression on her by leering in her face
one young man waiting on the walk outside for the appearance of another grinned at her as she passed
aint going my way are you he called jocosely
carrie turned her face to the west with a subdued heart
as she turned the corner she saw through the great shiny window the small desk at which she had applied
there were the crowds hurrying with the same buzz and energyyielding enthusiasm
she felt a slight relief but it was only at her escape
she felt ashamed in the face of better dressed girls who went by
she felt as though she should be better served and her heart revolted
chapter v a glittering night flower the use of a name drouet did not call that evening
after receiving the letter he had laid aside all thought of carrie for the time being and was floating around having what he considered a gay time
on this particular evening he dined at rectors a restaurant of some local fame which occupied a basement at clark and monroe streets
thereafter he visited the resort of fitzgerald and moys in adams street opposite the imposing federal building
there he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars one of which he lighted
this to him represented in part high lifea fair sample of what the whole must be
drouet was not a drinker in excess
he was not a moneyed man
he only craved the best as his mind conceived it and such doings seemed to him a part of the best
rectors with its polished marble walls and floor its profusion of lights its show of china and silverware and above all its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go
he loved fine clothes good eating and particularly the company and acquaintanceship of successful men
when dining it was a source of keen satisfaction to him to know that joseph jefferson was wont to come to this same place or that henry e dixie a wellknown performer of the day was then only a few tables off
at rectors he could always obtain this satisfaction for there one could encounter politicians brokers actors some rich young rounders of the town all eating and drinking amid a buzz of popular commonplace conversation
thats soandso over there was a common remark of these gentlemen among themselves particularly among those who had not yet reached but hoped to do so the dazzling height which money to dine here lavishly represented
you dont say so would be the reply
why yes didnt you know that
why hes manager of the grand opera house when these things would fall upon drouets ears he would straighten himself a little more stiffly and eat with solid comfort
if he had any vanity this augmented it and if he had any ambition this stirred it
he would be able to flash a roll of greenbacks too some day
as it was he could eat where they did
his preference for fitzgerald and moys adams street place was another yard off the same cloth
this was really a gorgeous saloon from a chicago standpoint
like rectors it was also ornamented with a blaze of incandescent lights held in handsome chandeliers
the floors were of brightly coloured tiles the walls a composition of rich dark polished wood which reflected the light and coloured stuccowork which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance
the long bar was a blaze of lights polished woodwork coloured and cut glassware and many fancy bottles
it was a truly swell saloon with rich screens fancy wines and a line of bar goods unsurpassed in the country
at rectors drouet had met mr g w hurstwood manager of fitzgerald and moys
he had been pointed out as a very successful and wellknown man about town
hurstwood looked the part for besides being slightly under forty he had a good stout constitution an active manner and a solid substantial air which was composed in part of his fine clothes his clean linen his jewels and above all his own sense of his importance
drouet immediately conceived a notion of him as being some one worth knowing and was glad not only to meet him but to visit the adams street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink or a cigar
hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind
he was shrewd and clever in many little things and capable of creating a good impression
his managerial position was fairly importanta kind of stewardship which was imposing but lacked financial control
he had risen by perseverance and industry through long years of service from the position of barkeeper in a commonplace saloon to his present altitude
he had a little office in the place set off in polished cherry and grillwork where he kept in a rolltop desk the rather simple accounts of the placesupplies ordered and needed
the chief executive and financial functions devolved upon the ownersmessrs
fitzgerald and moyand upon a cashier who looked after the money taken in
for the most part he lounged about dressed in excellent tailored suits of imported goods a solitaire ring a fine blue diamond in his tie a striking vest of some new pattern and a watchchain of solid gold which held a charm of rich design and a watch of the latest make and engraving
he knew by name and could greet personally with a well old fellow hundreds of actors merchants politicians and the general run of successful characters about town and it was part of his success to do so
he had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship which improved from the how do you do addressed to the fifteendollaraweek clerks and office attaches who by long frequenting of the place became aware of his position to the why old man how are you which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly
there was a class however too rich too famous or too successful with whom he could not attempt any familiarity of address and with these he was professionally tactful assuming a grave and dignified attitude paying them the deference which would win their good feeling without in the least compromising his own bearing and opinions
there were in the last place a few good followers neither rich nor poor famous nor yet remarkably successful with whom he was friendly on the score of goodfellowship
these were the kind of men with whom he would converse longest and most seriously
he loved to go out and have a good time once in a whileto go to the races the theatres the sporting entertainments at some of the clubs
he kept a horse and neat trap had his wife and two children who were well established in a neat house on the north side near lincoln park and was altogether a very acceptable individual of our great american upper classthe first grade below the luxuriously rich
hurstwood liked drouet
the latters genial nature and dressy appearance pleased him
he knew that drouet was only a travelling salesmanand not one of many years at thatbut the firm of bartlett caryoe company was a large and prosperous house and drouet stood well
hurstwood knew caryoe quite well having drunk a glass now and then with him in company with several others when the conversation was general
drouet had what was a help in his business a moderate sense of humour and could tell a good story when the occasion required
he could talk races with hurstwood tell interesting incidents concerning himself and his experiences with women and report the state of trade in the cities which he visited and so managed to make himself almost invariably agreeable
tonight he was particularly so since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon his new samples had been satisfactorily selected and his trip marked out for the next six weeks
why hello charlie old man said hurstwood as drouet came in that evening about eight oclock
how goes it the room was crowded
drouet shook hands beaming good nature and they strolled towards the bar
oh all right i havent seen you in six weeks
when did you get in friday said drouet
had a fine trip glad of it said hurstwood his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold makebelieve that usually dwelt in them
what are you going to take he added as the barkeeper in snowy jacket and tie leaned toward them from behind the bar
old pepper said drouet
a little of the same for me put in hurstwood
how long are you in town this time inquired hurstwood
only until wednesday
im going up to st paul george evans was in here saturday and said he saw you in milwaukee last week yes i saw george returned drouet
great old boy isnt he
we had quite a time there together the barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them and they now poured out the draught as they talked drouet filling his to within a third of full as was considered proper and hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer
whats become of caryoe remarked hurstwood
i havent seen him around here in two weeks laid up they say exclaimed drouet
say hes a gouty old boy made a lot of money in his time though hasnt he yes wads of it returned drouet
he wont live much longer
barely comes down to the office now just one boy hasnt he asked hurstwood
yes and a swiftpacer laughed drouet
i guess he cant hurt the business very much though with the other members all there no he cant injure that any i guess hurstwood was standing his coat open his thumbs in his pockets the light on his jewels and rings relieving them with agreeable distinctness
he was the picture of fastidious comfort
to one not inclined to drink and gifted with a more serious turn of mind such a bubbling chattering glittering chamber must ever seem an anomaly a strange commentary on nature and life
here come the moths in endless procession to bask in the light of the flame
such conversation as one may hear would not warrant a commendation of the scene upon intellectual grounds
it seems plain that schemers would choose more sequestered quarters to arrange their plans that politicians would not gather here in company to discuss anything save formalities where the sharpeared may hear and it would scarcely be justified on the score of thirst for the majority of those who frequent these more gorgeous places have no craving for liquor
nevertheless the fact that here men gather here chatter here love to pass and rub elbows must be explained upon some grounds
it must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires give rise to such a curious social institution or it would not be
drouet for one was lured as much by his longing for pleasure as by his desire to shine among his betters
the many friends he met here dropped in because they craved without perhaps consciously analysing it the company the glow the atmosphere which they found
one might take it after all as an augur of the better social order for the things which they satisfied here though sensory were not evil
no evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber
the worst effect of such a thing would be perhaps to stir up in the materialminded an ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis
in the last analysis that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations but rather of the innate trend of the mind
that such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed could scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected
remove the element so thoroughly and solely complained ofliquorand there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain
the pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion
yet here is the fact of the lighted chamber the dressy greedy company the small selfinterested palaver the disorganized aimless wandering mental action which it representsthe love of light and show and finery which to one outside under the serene light of the eternal stars must seem a strange and shiny thing
under the stars and sweeping night winds what a lampflower it must bloom a strange glittering nightflower odouryielding insectdrawing insectinfested rose of pleasure
see that fellow coming in there said hurstwood glancing at a gentleman just entering arrayed in a high hat and prince albert coat his fat cheeks puffed and red as with good eating
no where said drouet
there said hurstwood indicating the direction by a cast of his eye the man with the silk hat oh yes said drouet now affecting not to see
who is he thats jules wallace the spiritualist drouet followed him with his eyes much interested
doesnt look much like a man who sees spirits does he said drouet
oh i dont know returned hurstwood
hes got the money all right and a little twinkle passed over his eyes
i dont go much on those things do you asked drouet
well you never can tell said hurstwood
there may be something to it
i wouldnt bother about it myself though
by the way he added are you going anywhere tonight the hole in the ground said drouet mentioning the popular farce of the time
well youd better be going
its half after eight already and he drew out his watch
the crowd was already thinning out considerablysome bound for the theatres some to their clubs and some to that most fascinating of all the pleasuresfor the type of man there represented at leastthe ladies
yes i will said drouet
come around after the show
i have something i want to show you said hurstwood
sure said drouet elated
you havent anything on hand for the night have you added hurstwood
not a thing well come round then i struck a little peach coming in on the train friday remarked drouet by way of parting
by george thats so i must go and call on her before i go away oh never mind her hurstwood remarked
say she was a little dandy i tell you went on drouet confidentially and trying to impress his friend
twelve oclock said hurstwood
thats right said drouet going out
thus was carries name bandied about in the most frivolous and gay of places and that also when the little toiler was bemoaning her narrow lot which was almost inseparable from the early stages of this her unfolding fate
chapter vi
the machine and the maiden a knight of today at the flat that evening carrie felt a new phase of its atmosphere
the fact that it was unchanged while her feelings were different increased her knowledge of its character
minnie after the good spirits carrie manifested at first expected a fair report
hanson supposed that carrie would be satisfied
well he said as he came in from the hall in his working clothes and looked at carrie through the diningroom door how did you make out oh said carrie its pretty hard
i dont like it there was an air about her which showed plainer than any words that she was both weary and disappointed
what sort of work is it he asked lingering a moment as he turned upon his heel to go into the bathroom
running a machine answered carrie
it was very evident that it did not concern him much save from the side of the flats success
he was irritated a shade because it could not have come about in the throw of fortune for carrie to be pleased
minnie worked with less elation than she had just before carrie arrived
the sizzle of the meat frying did not sound quite so pleasing now that carrie had reported her discontent
to carrie the one relief of the whole day would have been a jolly home a sympathetic reception a bright supper table and some one to say oh well stand it a little while
you will get something better but now this was ashes
she began to see that they looked upon her complaint as unwarranted and that she was supposed to work on and say nothing
she knew that she was to pay four dollars for her board and room and now she felt that it would be an exceedingly gloomy round living with these people
minnie was no companion for her sistershe was too old
her thoughts were staid and solemnly adapted to a condition
if hanson had any pleasant thoughts or happy feelings he concealed them
he seemed to do all his mental operations without the aid of physical expression
he was as still as a deserted chamber
carrie on the other hand had the blood of youth and some imagination
her day of love and the mysteries of courtship were still ahead
she could think of things she would like to do of clothes she would like to wear and of places she would like to visit
these were the things upon which her mind ran and it was like meeting with opposition at every turn to find no one here to call forth or respond to her feelings
she had forgotten in considering and explaining the result of her day that drouet might come
now when she saw how unreceptive these two people were she hoped he would not
she did not know exactly what she would do or how she would explain to drouet if he came
after supper she changed her clothes
when she was trimly dressed she was rather a sweet little being with large eyes and a sad mouth
her face expressed the mingled expectancy dissatisfaction and depression she felt
she wandered about after the dishes were put away talked a little with minnie and then decided to go down and stand in the door at the foot of the stairs
if drouet came she could meet him there
her face took on the semblance of a look of happiness as she put on her hat to go below
carrie doesnt seem to like her place very well said minnie to her husband when the latter came out paper in hand to sit in the diningroom a few minutes
she ought to keep it for a time anyhow said hanson
has she gone downstairs yes said minnie
id tell her to keep it if i were you
she might be here weeks without getting another one minnie said she would and hanson read his paper
if i were you he said a little later i wouldnt let her stand in the door down there
it dont look good ill tell her said minnie
the life of the streets continued for a long time to interest carrie
she never wearied of wondering where the people in the cars were going or what their enjoyments were
her imagination trod a very narrow round always winding up at points which concerned money looks clothes or enjoyment
she would have a faroff thought of columbia city now and then or an irritating rush of feeling concerning her experiences of the present day but on the whole the little world about her enlisted her whole attention
the first floor of the building of which hansons flat was the third was occupied by a bakery and to this while she was standing there hanson came down to buy a loaf of bread
she was not aware of his presence until he was quite near her
im after bread was all he said as he passed
the contagion of thought here demonstrated itself
while hanson really came for bread the thought dwelt with him that now he would see what carrie was doing
no sooner did he draw near her with that in mind than she felt it
of course she had no understanding of what put it into her head but nevertheless it aroused in her the first shade of real antipathy to him
she knew now that she did not like him
he was suspicious
a thought will colour a world for us
the flow of carries meditations had been disturbed and hanson had not long gone upstairs before she followed
she had realised with the lapse of the quarter hours that drouet was not coming and somehow she felt a little resentful a little as if she had been forsakenwas not good enough
she went upstairs where everything was silent
minnie was sewing by a lamp at the table
hanson had already turned in for the night
in her weariness and disappointment carrie did no more than announce that she was going to bed
yes youd better returned minnie
youve got to get up early you know the morning was no better
hanson was just going out the door as carrie came from her room
minnie tried to talk with her during breakfast but there was not much of interest which they could mutually discuss
as on the previous morning carrie walked down town for she began to realise now that her fourfifty would not even allow her car fare after she paid her board
this seemed a miserable arrangement
but the morning light swept away the first misgivings of the day as morning light is ever wont to do
at the shoe factory she put in a long day scarcely so wearisome as the preceding but considerably less novel
the head foreman on his round stopped by her machine
where did you come from he inquired
mr
brown hired me she replied
oh he did eh and then see that you keep things going the machine girls impressed her even less favourably
they seemed satisfied with their lot and were in a sense common carrie had more imagination than they
she was not used to slang
her instinct in the matter of dress was naturally better
she disliked to listen to the girl next to her who was rather hardened by experience
im going to quit this she heard her remark to her neighbour
what with the stipend and being up late its too much for me health they were free with the fellows young and old about the place and exchanged banter in rude phrases which at first shocked her
she saw that she was taken to be of the same sort and addressed accordingly
hello remarked one of the stoutwristed soleworkers to her at noon
youre a daisy he really expected to hear the common aw
go chase yourself in return and was sufficiently abashed by carries silently moving away to retreat awkwardly grinning
that night at the flat she was even more lonelythe dull situation was becoming harder to endure
she could see that the hansons seldom or never had any company
standing at the street door looking out she ventured to walk out a little way
her easy gait and idle manner attracted attention of an offensive but common sort
she was slightly taken back at the overtures of a welldressed man of thirty who in passing looked at her reduced his pace turned back and said out for a little stroll are you this evening carrie looked at him in amazement and then summoned sufficient thought to reply why i dont know you backing away as she did so
oh that dont matter said the other affably
she bandied no more words with him but hurried away reaching her own door quite out of breath
there was something in the mans look which frightened her
during the remainder of the week it was very much the same
one or two nights she found herself too tired to walk home and expended car fare
she was not very strong and sitting all day affected her back
she went to bed one night before hanson
transplantation is not always successful in the matter of flowers or maidens
it requires sometimes a richer soil a better atmosphere to continue even a natural growth
it would have been better if her acclimatization had been more gradualless rigid
she would have done better if she had not secured a position so quickly and had seen more of the city which she constantly troubled to know about
on the first morning it rained she found that she had no umbrella
minnie loaned her one of hers which was worn and faded
there was the kind of vanity in carrie that troubled at this
she went to one of the great department stores and bought herself one using a dollar and a quarter of her small store to pay for it
what did you do that for carrie asked minnie when she saw it
oh i need one said carrie
you foolish girl carrie resented this though she did not reply
she was not going to be a common shopgirl she thought they need not think it either
on the first saturday night carrie paid her board four dollars
minnie had a quaver of conscience as she took it but did not know how to explain to hanson if she took less
that worthy gave up just four dollars less toward the household expenses with a smile of satisfaction
he contemplated increasing his building and loan payments
as for carrie she studied over the problem of finding clothes and amusement on fifty cents a week
she brooded over this until she was in a state of mental rebellion
im going up the street for a walk she said after supper
not alone are you asked hanson
yes returned carrie
i wouldnt said minnie
i want to see something said carrie and by the tone she put into the last word they realised for the first time she was not pleased with them
whats the matter with her asked hanson when she went into the front room to get her hat
i dont know said minnie
well she ought to know better than to want to go out alone carrie did not go very far after all
she returned and stood in the door
the next day they went out to garfield park but it did not please her
she did not look well enough
in the shop next day she heard the highly coloured reports which girls give of their trivial amusements
they had been happy
on several days it rained and she used up car fare
one night she got thoroughly soaked going to catch the car at van buren street
all that evening she sat alone in the front room looking out upon the street where the lights were reflected on the wet pavements thinking
she had imagination enough to be moody
on saturday she paid another four dollars and pocketed her fifty cents in despair
the speaking acquaintanceship which she formed with some of the girls at the shop discovered to her the fact that they had more of their earnings to use for themselves than she did
they had young men of the kind whom she since her experience with drouet felt above who took them about
she came to thoroughly dislike the lightheaded young fellows of the shop
not one of them had a show of refinement
she saw only their workday side
there came a day when the first premonitory blast of winter swept over the city
it scudded the fleecy clouds in the heavens trailed long thin streamers of smoke from the tall stacks and raced about the streets and corners in sharp and sudden puffs
carrie now felt the problem of winter clothes
what was she to do
she had no winter jacket no hat no shoes
it was difficult to speak to minnie about this but at last she summoned the courage
i dont know what im going to do about clothes she said one evening when they were together
i need a hat minnie looked serious
why dont you keep part of your money and buy yourself one she suggested worried over the situation which the withholding of carries money would create
id like to for a week or so if you dont mind ventured carrie
could you pay two dollars asked minnie
carrie readily acquiesced glad to escape the trying situation and liberal now that she saw a way out
she was elated and began figuring at once
she needed a hat first of all
how minnie explained to hanson she never knew
he said nothing at all but there were thoughts in the air which left disagreeable impressions
the new arrangement might have worked if sickness had not intervened
it blew up cold after a rain one afternoon when carrie was still without a jacket
she came out of the warm shop at six and shivered as the wind struck her
in the morning she was sneezing and going down town made it worse
that day her bones ached and she felt lightheaded
towards evening she felt very ill and when she reached home was not hungry
minnie noticed her drooping actions and asked her about herself
i dont know said carrie
i feel real bad she hung about the stove suffered a chattering chill and went to bed sick
the next morning she was thoroughly feverish
minnie was truly distressed at this but maintained a kindly demeanour
hanson said perhaps she had better go back home for a while
when she got up after three days it was taken for granted that her position was lost
the winter was near at hand she had no clothes and now she was out of work
i dont know said carrie ill go down monday and see if i cant get something if anything her efforts were more poorly rewarded on this trial than the last
her clothes were nothing suitable for fall wearing
her last money she had spent for a hat
for three days she wandered about utterly dispirited
the attitude of the flat was fast becoming unbearable
she hated to think of going back there each evening
hanson was so cold
she knew it could not last much longer
shortly she would have to give up and go home
on the fourth day she was down town all day having borrowed ten cents for lunch from minnie
she had applied in the cheapest kind of places without success
she even answered for a waitress in a small restaurant where she saw a card in the window but they wanted an experienced girl
she moved through the thick throng of strangers utterly subdued in spirit
suddenly a hand pulled her arm and turned her about
well well said a voice
in the first glance she beheld drouet
he was not only rosycheeked but radiant
he was the essence of sunshine and goodhumour
why how are you carrie he said
youre a daisy
where have you been carrie smiled under his irresistible flood of geniality
ive been out home she said
well he said i saw you across the street there
i thought it was you
i was just coming out to your place
how are you anyhow im all right said carrie smiling
drouet looked her over and saw something different
well he said i want to talk to you
youre not going anywhere in particular are you not just now said carrie
lets go up here and have something to eat
george
but im glad to see you again she felt so relieved in his radiant presence so much looked after and cared for that she assented gladly though with the slightest air of holding back
well he said as he took her armand there was an exuberance of goodfellowship in the word which fairly warmed the cockles of her heart
they went through monroe street to the old windsor diningroom which was then a large comfortable place with an excellent cuisine and substantial service
drouet selected a table close by the window where the busy rout of the street could be seen
he loved the changing panorama of the streetto see and be seen as he dined
now he said getting carrie and himself comfortably settled what will you have carrie looked over the large bill of fare which the waiter handed her without really considering it
she was very hungry and the things she saw there awakened her desires but the high prices held her attention
half broiled spring chickenseventyfive
sirloin steak with mushroomsone twentyfive she had dimly heard of these things but it seemed strange to be called to order from the list
ill fix this exclaimed drouet
sst
waiter that officer of the board a fullchested roundfaced negro approached and inclined his ear
sirloin with mushrooms said drouet
stuffed tomatoes yassah assented the negro nodding his head
hashed brown potatoes yassah asparagus yassah and a pot of coffee drouet turned to carrie
i havent had a thing since breakfast
just got in from rock island
i was going off to dine when i saw you carrie smiled and smiled
what have you been doing he went on
tell me all about yourself
how is your sister shes well returned carrie answering the last query
he looked at her hard
say he said you havent been sick have you carrie nodded
well now thats a blooming shame isnt it
you dont look very well
i thought you looked a little pale
what have you been doing working said carrie
you dont say so
at what she told him
rhodes morgenthau and scottwhy i know that house over here on fifth avenue isnt it
theyre a closefisted concern
what made you go there i couldnt get anything else said carrie frankly
well thats an outrage said drouet
you oughtnt to be working for those people
have the factory right back of the store dont they yes said carrie
that isnt a good house said drouet
you dont want to work at anything like that anyhow he chatted on at a great rate asking questions explaining things about himself telling her what a good restaurant it was until the waiter returned with an immense tray bearing the hot savoury dishes which had been ordered
drouet fairly shone in the matter of serving
he appeared to great advantage behind the white napery and silver platters of the table and displaying his arms with a knife and fork
as he cut the meat his rings almost spoke
his new suit creaked as he stretched to reach the plates break the bread and pour the coffee
he helped carrie to a rousing plateful and contributed the warmth of his spirit to her body until she was a new girl
he was a splendid fellow in the true popular understanding of the term and captivated carrie completely
that little soldier of fortune took her good turn in an easy way
she felt a little out of place but the great room soothed her and the view of the welldressed throng outside seemed a splendid thing
ah what was it not to have money
what a thing it was to be able to come in here and dine
drouet must be fortunate
he rode on trains dressed in such nice clothes was so strong and ate in these fine places
he seemed quite a figure of a man and she wondered at his friendship and regard for her
so you lost your place because you got sick eh he said
what are you going to do now look around she said a thought of the need that hung outside this fine restaurant like a hungry dog at her heels passing into her eyes
oh no said drouet that wont do
how long have you been looking four days she answered
think of that he said addressing some problematical individual
you oughtnt to be doing anything like that
these girls and he waved an inclusion of all shop and factory girls dont get anything
why you cant live on it can you he was a brotherly sort of creature in his demeanour
when he had scouted the idea of that kind of toil he took another tack
carrie was really very pretty
even then in her commonplace garb her figure was evidently not bad and her eyes were large and gentle
drouet looked at her and his thoughts reached home
she felt his admiration
it was powerfully backed by his liberality and goodhumour
she felt that she liked himthat she could continue to like him ever so much
there was something even richer than that running as a hidden strain in her mind
every little while her eyes would meet his and by that means the interchanging current of feeling would be fully connected
why dont you stay down town and go to the theatre with me he said hitching his chair closer
the table was not very wide
oh i cant she said
what are you going to do tonight nothing she answered a little drearily
you dont like out there where you are do you oh i dont know what are you going to do if you dont get work go back home i guess there was the least quaver in her voice as she said this
somehow the influence he was exerting was powerful
they came to an understanding of each other without wordshe of her situation she of the fact that he realised it
no he said you cant make it genuine sympathy filling his mind for the time
let me help you
you take some of my money oh no she said leaning back
what are you going to do he said
she sat meditating merely shaking her head
he looked at her quite tenderly for his kind
there were some loose bills in his vest pocketgreenbacks
they were soft and noiseless and he got his fingers about them and crumpled them up in his hand
come on he said ill see you through all right
get yourself some clothes it was the first reference he had made to that subject and now she realised how bad off she was
in his crude way he had struck the keynote
her lips trembled a little
she had her hand out on the table before her
they were quite alone in their corner and he put his larger warmer hand over it
aw come carrie he said what can you do alone
let me help you he pressed her hand gently and she tried to withdraw it
at this he held it fast and she no longer protested
then he slipped the greenbacks he had into her palm and when she began to protest he whispered ill loan it to youthats all right
ill loan it to you he made her take it
she felt bound to him by a strange tie of affection now
they went out and he walked with her far out south toward polk street talking
you dont want to live with those people he said in one place abstractedly
carrie heard it but it made only a slight impression
come down and meet me tomorrow he said and well go to the matine
will you carrie protested a while but acquiesced
youre not doing anything
get yourself a nice pair of shoes and a jacket she scarcely gave a thought to the complication which would trouble her when he was gone
in his presence she was of his own hopeful easywayout mood
dont you bother about those people out there he said at parting
ill help you carrie left him feeling as though a great arm had slipped out before her to draw off trouble
the money she had accepted was two soft green handsome tendollar bills
chapter vii
the lure of the material beauty speaks for itself the true meaning of money yet remains to be popularly explained and comprehended
when each individual realises for himself that this thing primarily stands for and should only be accepted as a moral duethat it should be paid out as honestly stored energy and not as a usurped privilegemany of our social religious and political troubles will have permanently passed
as for carrie her understanding of the moral significance of money was the popular understanding nothing more
the old definition money something everybody else has and i must get would have expressed her understanding of it thoroughly
some of it she now held in her handtwo soft green tendollar billsand she felt that she was immensely better off for the having of them
it was something that was power in itself
one of her order of mind would have been content to be cast away upon a desert island with a bundle of money and only the long strain of starvation would have taught her that in some cases it could have no value
even then she would have had no conception of the relative value of the thing her one thought would undoubtedly have concerned the pity of having so much power and the inability to use it
the poor girl thrilled as she walked away from drouet
she felt ashamed in part because she had been weak enough to take it but her need was so dire she was still glad
now she would have a nice new jacket
now she would buy a nice pair of pretty button shoes
she would get stockings too and a skirt and anduntil already as in the matter of her prospective salary she had got beyond in her desires twice the purchasing power of her bills
she conceived a true estimate of drouet
to her and indeed to all the world he was a nice goodhearted man
there was nothing evil in the fellow
he gave her the money out of a good heartout of a realisation of her want
he would not have given the same amount to a poor young man but we must not forget that a poor young man could not in the nature of things have appealed to him like a poor young girl
femininity affected his feelings
he was the creature of an inborn desire
yet no beggar could have caught his eye and said my god mister im starving but he would gladly have handed out what was considered the proper portion to give beggars and thought no more about it
there would have been no speculation no philosophising
he had no mental process in him worthy the dignity of either of those terms
in his good clothes and fine health he was a merry unthinking moth of the lamp
deprived of his position and struck by a few of the involved and baffling forces which sometimes play upon man he would have been as helpless as carrieas helpless as nonunderstanding as pitiable if you will as she
now in regard to his pursuit of women he meant them no harm because he did not conceive of the relation which he hoped to hold with them as being harmful
he loved to make advances to women to have them succumb to his charms not because he was a coldblooded dark scheming villain but because his inborn desire urged him to that as a chief delight
he was vain he was boastful he was as deluded by fine clothes as any sillyheaded girl
a truly deepdyed villain could have hornswaggled him as readily as he could have flattered a pretty shopgirl
his fine success as a salesman lay in his geniality and the thoroughly reputable standing of his house
he bobbed about among men a veritable bundle of enthusiasmno power worthy the name of intellect no thoughts worthy the adjective noble no feelings long continued in one strain
a madame sappho would have called him a pig a shakespeare would have said my merry child old drinking caryoe thought him a clever successful businessman
in short he was as good as his intellect conceived
the best proof that there was something open and commendable about the man was the fact that carrie took the money
no deep sinister soul with ulterior motives could have given her fifteen cents under the guise of friendship
the unintellectual are not so helpless
nature has taught the beasts of the field to fly when some unheralded danger threatens
she has put into the small unwise head of the chipmunk the untutored fear of poisons
he keepeth his creatures whole was not written of beasts alone
carrie was unwise and therefore like the sheep in its unwisdom strong in feeling
the instinct of selfprotection strong in all such natures was roused but feebly if at all by the overtures of drouet
when carrie had gone he felicitated himself upon her good opinion
by george it was a shame young girls had to be knocked around like that
cold weather coming on and no clothes
tough
he would go around to fitzgerald and moys and get a cigar
it made him feel light of foot as he thought about her
carrie reached home in high good spirits which she could scarcely conceal
the possession of the money involved a number of points which perplexed her seriously
how should she buy any clothes when minnie knew that she had no money
she had no sooner entered the flat than this point was settled for her
it could not be done
she could think of no way of explaining
how did you come out asked minnie referring to the day
carrie had none of the small deception which could feel one thing and say something directly opposed
she would prevaricate but it would be in the line of her feelings at least
so instead of complaining when she felt so good she said i have the promise of something where at the boston store is it sure promised questioned minnie
well im to find out tomorrow returned carrie disliking to draw out a lie any longer than was necessary
minnie felt the atmosphere of good feeling which carrie brought with her
she felt now was the time to express to carrie the state of hansons feeling about her entire chicago venture
if you shouldnt get it she paused troubled for an easy way
if i dont get something pretty soon i think ill go home minnie saw her chance
sven thinks it might be best for the winter anyhow the situation flashed on carrie at once
they were unwilling to keep her any longer out of work
she did not blame minnie she did not blame hanson very much
now as she sat there digesting the remark she was glad she had drouets money
yes she said after a few moments i thought of doing that she did not explain that the thought however had aroused all the antagonism of her nature
columbia city what was there for her
she knew its dull little round by heart
here was the great mysterious city which was still a magnet for her
what she had seen only suggested its possibilities
now to turn back on it and live the little old life out thereshe almost exclaimed against the thought
she had reached home early and went in the front room to think
what could she do
she could not buy new shoes and wear them here
she would need to save part of the twenty to pay her fare home
she did not want to borrow of minnie for that
and yet how could she explain where she even got that money
if she could only get enough to let her out easy
she went over the tangle again and again
here in the morning drouet would expect to see her in a new jacket and that couldnt be
the hansons expected her to go home and she wanted to get away and yet she did not want to go home
in the light of the way they would look on her getting money without work the taking of it now seemed dreadful
she began to be ashamed
the whole situation depressed her
it was all so clear when she was with drouet
now it was all so tangled so hopelessmuch worse than it was before because she had the semblance of aid in her hand which she could not use
her spirits sank so that at supper minnie felt that she must have had another hard day
carrie finally decided that she would give the money back
it was wrong to take it
she would go down in the morning and hunt for work
at noon she would meet drouet as agreed and tell him
at this decision her heart sank until she was the old carrie of distress
curiously she could not hold the money in her hand without feeling some relief
even after all her depressing conclusions she could sweep away all thought about the matter and then the twenty dollars seemed a wonderful and delightful thing
ah money money money
what a thing it was to have
how plenty of it would clear away all these troubles
in the morning she got up and started out a little early
her decision to hunt for work was moderately strong but the money in her pocket after all her troubling over it made the work question the least shade less terrible
she walked into the wholesale district but as the thought of applying came with each passing concern her heart shrank
what a coward she was she thought to herself
yet she had applied so often
it would be the same old story
she walked on and on and finally did go into one place with the old result
she came out feeling that luck was against her
it was no use
without much thinking she reached dearborn street
here was the great fair store with its multitude of delivery wagons about its long window display its crowd of shoppers
it readily changed her thoughts she who was so weary of them
it was here that she had intended to come and get her new things
now for relief from distress she thought she would go in and see
she would look at the jackets
there is nothing in this world more delightful than that middle state in which we mentally balance at times possessed of the means lured by desire and yet deterred by conscience or want of decision
when carrie began wandering around the store amid the fine displays she was in this mood
her original experience in this same place had given her a high opinion of its merits
now she paused at each individual bit of finery where before she had hurried on
her womans heart was warm with desire for them
how would she look in this how charming that would make her
she came upon the corset counter and paused in rich reverie as she noted the dainty concoctions of colour and lace there displayed
if she would only make up her mind she could have one of those now
she lingered in the jewelry department
she saw the earrings the bracelets the pins the chains
what would she not have given if she could have had them all
she would look fine too if only she had some of these things
the jackets were the greatest attraction
when she entered the store she already had her heart fixed upon the peculiar little tan jacket with large motherofpearl buttons which was all the rage that fall
still she delighted to convince herself that there was nothing she would like better
she went about among the glass cases and racks where these things were displayed and satisfied herself that the one she thought of was the proper one
all the time she wavered in mind now persuading herself that she could buy it right away if she chose now recalling to herself the actual condition
at last the noon hour was dangerously near and she had done nothing
she must go now and return the money
drouet was on the corner when she came up
hello he said where is the jacket andlooking downthe shoes carrie had thought to lead up to her decision in some intelligent way but this swept the whole foreschemed situation by the board
i came to tell you thatthat i cant take the money oh thats it is it he returned
well you come on with me
lets go over here to partridges carrie walked with him
behold the whole fabric of doubt and impossibility had slipped from her mind
she could not get at the points that were so serious the things she was going to make plain to him
have you had lunch yet
of course you havent
lets go in here and drouet turned into one of the very nicely furnished restaurants off state street in monroe
i mustnt take the money said carrie after they were settled in a cosey corner and drouet had ordered the lunch
i cant wear those things out there
theythey wouldnt know where i got them what do you want to do he smiled go without them i think ill go home she said wearily
oh come he said youve been thinking it over too long
ill tell you what you do
you say you cant wear them out there
why dont you rent a furnished room and leave them in that for a week carrie shook her head
like all women she was there to object and be convinced
it was for him to brush the doubts away and clear the path if he could
why are you going home he asked
oh i cant get anything here they wont keep you he remarked intuitively
they cant said carrie
ill tell you what you do he said
you come with me
ill take care of you carrie heard this passively
the peculiar state which she was in made it sound like the welcome breath of an open door
drouet seemed of her own spirit and pleasing
he was clean handsome welldressed and sympathetic
his voice was the voice of a friend
what can you do back at columbia city he went on rousing by the words in carries mind a picture of the dull world she had left
there isnt anything down there
chicagos the place
you can get a nice room here and some clothes and then you can do something carrie looked out through the window into the busy street
there it was the admirable great city so fine when you are not poor
an elegant coach with a prancing pair of bays passed by carrying in its upholstered depths a young lady
what will you have if you go back asked drouet
there was no subtle undercurrent to the question
he imagined that she would have nothing at all of the things he thought worth while
carrie sat still looking out
she was wondering what she could do
they would be expecting her to go home this week
drouet turned to the subject of the clothes she was going to buy
why not get yourself a nice little jacket
youve got to have it
ill loan you the money
you neednt worry about taking it
you can get yourself a nice room by yourself
i wont hurt you carrie saw the drift but could not express her thoughts
she felt more than ever the helplessness of her case
if i could only get something to do she said
maybe you can went on drouet if you stay here
you cant if you go away
they wont let you stay out there
now why not let me get you a nice room
i wont bother youyou neednt be afraid
then when you get fixed up maybe you could get something he looked at her pretty face and it vivified his mental resources
she was a sweet little mortal to himthere was no doubt of that
she seemed to have some power back of her actions
she was not like the common run of storegirls
she wasnt silly
in reality carrie had more imagination than hemore taste
it was a finer mental strain in her that made possible her depression and loneliness
her poor clothes were neat and she held her head unconsciously in a dainty way
do you think i could get something she asked
sure he said reaching over and filling her cup with tea
ill help you she looked at him and he laughed reassuringly
now ill tell you what well do
well go over here to partridges and you pick out what you want
then well look around for a room for you
you can leave the things there
then well go to the show tonight carrie shook her head
well you can go out to the flat then thats all right
you dont need to stay in the room
just take it and leave your things there she hung in doubt about this until the dinner was over
lets go over and look at the jackets he said
together they went
in the store they found that shine and rustle of new things which immediately laid hold of carries heart
under the influence of a good dinner and drouets radiating presence the scheme proposed seemed feasible
she looked about and picked a jacket like the one which she had admired at the fair
when she got it in her hand it seemed so much nicer
the saleswoman helped her on with it and by accident it fitted perfectly
drouets face lightened as he saw the improvement
she looked quite smart
thats the thing he said
carrie turned before the glass
she could not help feeling pleased as she looked at herself
a warm glow crept into her cheeks
thats the thing said drouet
now pay for it its nine dollars said carrie
thats all righttake it said drouet
she reached in her purse and took out one of the bills
the woman asked if she would wear the coat and went off
in a few minutes she was back and the purchase was closed
from partridges they went to a shoe store where carrie was fitted for shoes
drouet stood by and when he saw how nice they looked said wear them carrie shook her head however
she was thinking of returning to the flat
he bought her a purse for one thing and a pair of gloves for another and let her buy the stockings
tomorrow he said you come down here and buy yourself a skirt in all of carries actions there was a touch of misgiving
the deeper she sank into the entanglement the more she imagined that the thing hung upon the few remaining things she had not done
since she had not done these there was a way out
drouet knew a place in wabash avenue where there were rooms
he showed carrie the outside of these and said now youre my sister he carried the arrangement off with an easy hand when it came to the selection looking around criticising opining
her trunk will be here in a day or so he observed to the landlady who was very pleased
when they were alone drouet did not change in the least
he talked in the same general way as if they were out in the street
carrie left her things
now said drouet why dont you move tonight oh i cant said carrie
why not i dont want to leave them so he took that up as they walked along the avenue
it was a warm afternoon
the sun had come out and the wind had died down
as he talked with carrie he secured an accurate detail of the atmosphere of the flat
come out of it he said they wont care
ill help you get along she listened until her misgivings vanished
he would show her about a little and then help her get something
he really imagined that he would
he would be out on the road and she could be working
now ill tell you what you do he said you go out there and get whatever you want and come away she thought a long time about this
finally she agreed
he would come out as far as peoria street and wait for her
she was to meet him at halfpast eight
at halfpast five she reached home and at six her determination was hardened
so you didnt get it said minnie referring to carries story of the boston store
carrie looked at her out of the corner of her eye
no she answered
i dont think youd better try any more this fall said minnie
carrie said nothing
when hanson came home he wore the same inscrutable demeanour
he washed in silence and went off to read his paper
at dinner carrie felt a little nervous
the strain of her own plans were considerable and the feeling that she was not welcome here was strong
didnt find anything eh said hanson
no he turned to his eating again the thought that it was a burden to have her here dwelling in his mind
she would have to go home that was all
once she was away there would be no more coming back in the spring
carrie was afraid of what she was going to do but she was relieved to know that this condition was ending
they would not care
hanson particularly would be glad when she went
he would not care what became of her
after dinner she went into the bathroom where they could not disturb her and wrote a little note
goodbye minnie it read
im not going home
im going to stay in chicago a little while and look for work
dont worry
ill be all right in the front room hanson was reading his paper
as usual she helped minnie clear away the dishes and straighten up
then she said i guess ill stand down at the door a little while she could scarcely prevent her voice from trembling
minnie remembered hansons remonstrance
sven doesnt think it looks good to stand down there she said
doesnt he said carrie
i wont do it any more after this she put on her hat and fidgeted around the table in the little bedroom wondering where to slip the note
finally she put it under minnies hairbrush
when she had closed the halldoor she paused a moment and wondered what they would think
some thought of the queerness of her deed affected her
she went slowly down the stairs
she looked back up the lighted step and then affected to stroll up the street
when she reached the corner she quickened her pace
as she was hurrying away hanson came back to his wife
is carrie down at the door again he asked
yes said minnie she said she wasnt going to do it any more he went over to the baby where it was playing on the floor and began to poke his finger at it
drouet was on the corner waiting in good spirits
hello carrie he said as a sprightly figure of a girl drew near him
got here safe did you
well well take a car chapter viii
intimations by winter an ambassador summoned among the forces which sweep and play throughout the universe untutored man is but a wisp in the wind
our civilisation is still in a middle stage scarcely beast in that it is no longer wholly guided by instinct scarcely human in that it is not yet wholly guided by reason
on the tiger no responsibility rests
we see him aligned by nature with the forces of lifehe is born into their keeping and without thought he is protected
we see man far removed from the lairs of the jungles his innate instincts dulled by too near an approach to freewill his freewill not sufficiently developed to replace his instincts and afford him perfect guidance
he is becoming too wise to hearken always to instincts and desires he is still too weak to always prevail against them
as a beast the forces of life aligned him with them as a man he has not yet wholly learned to align himself with the forces
in this intermediate stage he waversneither drawn in harmony with nature by his instincts nor yet wisely putting himself into harmony by his own freewill
he is even as a wisp in the wind moved by every breath of passion acting now by his will and now by his instincts erring with one only to retrieve by the other falling by one only to rise by the othera creature of incalculable variability
we have the consolation of knowing that evolution is ever in action that the ideal is a light that cannot fail
he will not forever balance thus between good and evil
when this jangle of freewill instinct shall have been adjusted when perfect understanding has given the former the power to replace the latter entirely man will no longer vary
the needle of understanding will yet point steadfast and unwavering to the distinct pole of truth
in carrieas in how many of our worldlings do they notinstinct and reason desire and understanding were at war for the mastery
she followed whither her craving led
she was as yet more drawn than she drew
when minnie found the note next morning after a night of mingled wonder and anxiety which was not exactly touched by yearning sorrow or love she exclaimed well what do you think of that what said hanson
sister carrie has gone to live somewhere else hanson jumped out of bed with more celerity than he usually displayed and looked at the note
the only indication of his thoughts came in the form of a little clicking sound made by his tongue the sound some people make when they wish to urge on a horse
where do you suppose shes gone to said minnie thoroughly aroused
i dont know a touch of cynicism lighting his eye
now she has gone and done it minnie moved her head in a puzzled way
oh oh she said she doesnt know what she has done well said hanson after a while sticking his hands out before him what can you do minnies womanly nature was higher than this
she figured the possibilities in such cases
oh she said at last poor sister carrie at the time of this particular conversation which occurred at am that little soldier of fortune was sleeping a rather troubled sleep in her new room alone
carries new state was remarkable in that she saw possibilities in it
she was no sensualist longing to drowse sleepily in the lap of luxury
she turned about troubled by her daring glad of her release wondering whether she would get something to do wondering what drouet would do
that worthy had his future fixed for him beyond a peradventure
he could not help what he was going to do
he could not see clearly enough to wish to do differently
he was drawn by his innate desire to act the old pursuing part
he would need to delight himself with carrie as surely as he would need to eat his heavy breakfast
he might suffer the least rudimentary twinge of conscience in whatever he did and in just so far he was evil and sinning
but whatever twinges of conscience he might have would be rudimentary you may be sure
the next day he called upon carrie and she saw him in her chamber
he was the same jolly enlivening soul
aw he said what are you looking so blue about
come on out to breakfast
you want to get your other clothes today carrie looked at him with the hue of shifting thought in her large eyes
i wish i could get something to do she said
youll get that all right said drouet
whats the use worrying right now
get yourself fixed up
see the city
i wont hurt you i know you wont she remarked half truthfully
got on the new shoes havent you
stick em out
george they look fine
put on your jacket carrie obeyed
say that fits like a t dont it he remarked feeling the set of it at the waist and eyeing it from a few paces with real pleasure
what you need now is a new skirt
lets go to breakfast carrie put on her hat
where are the gloves he inquired
here she said taking them out of the bureau drawer
now come on he said
thus the first hour of misgiving was swept away
it went this way on every occasion
drouet did not leave her much alone
she had time for some lone wanderings but mostly he filled her hours with sightseeing
at carson piries he bought her a nice skirt and shirt waist
with his money she purchased the little necessaries of toilet until at last she looked quite another maiden
the mirror convinced her of a few things which she had long believed
she was pretty yes indeed
how nice her hat set and werent her eyes pretty
she caught her little red lip with her teeth and felt her first thrill of power
drouet was so good
they went to see the mikado one evening an opera which was hilariously popular at that time
before going they made off for the windsor diningroom which was in dearborn street a considerable distance from carries room
it was blowing up cold and out of her window carrie could see the western sky still pink with the fading light but steely blue at the top where it met the darkness
a long thin cloud of pink hung in midair shaped like some island in a faroff sea
somehow the swaying of some dead branches of trees across the way brought back the picture with which she was familiar when she looked from their front window in december days at home
she paused and wrung her little hands
whats the matter said drouet
oh i dont know she said her lip trembling
he sensed something and slipped his arm over her shoulder patting her arm
come on he said gently youre all right she turned to slip on her jacket
better wear that boa about your throat tonight they walked north on wabash to adams street and then west
the lights in the stores were already shining out in gushes of golden hue
the arc lights were sputtering overhead and high up were the lighted windows of the tall office buildings
the chill wind whipped in and out in gusty breaths
homeward bound the six oclock throng bumped and jostled
light overcoats were turned up about the ears hats were pulled down
little shopgirls went fluttering by in pairs and fours chattering laughing
it was a spectacle of warmblooded humanity
suddenly a pair of eyes met carries in recognition
they were looking out from a group of poorly dressed girls
their clothes were faded and loosehanging their jackets old their general makeup shabby
carrie recognised the glance and the girl
she was one of those who worked at the machines in the shoe factory
the latter looked not quite sure and then turned her head and looked
carrie felt as if some great tide had rolled between them
the old dress and the old machine came back
she actually started
drouet didnt notice until carrie bumped into a pedestrian
you must be thinking he said
they dined and went to the theatre
that spectacle pleased carrie immensely
the colour and grace of it caught her eye
she had vain imaginings about place and power about faroff lands and magnificent people
when it was over the clatter of coaches and the throng of fine ladies made her stare
wait a minute said drouet holding her back in the showy foyer where ladies and gentlemen were moving in a social crush skirts rustling lacecovered heads nodding white teeth showing through parted lips
lets see sixtyseven the coachcaller was saying his voice lifted in a sort of euphonious cry
sixtyseven isnt it fine said carrie
great said drouet
he was as much affected by this show of finery and gayety as she
he pressed her arm warmly
once she looked up her even teeth glistening through her smiling lips her eyes alight
as they were moving out he whispered down to her you look lovely they were right where the coachcaller was swinging open a coachdoor and ushering in two ladies
you stick to me and well have a coach laughed drouet
carrie scarcely heard her head was so full of the swirl of life
they stopped in at a restaurant for a little aftertheatre lunch
just a shade of a thought of the hour entered carries head but there was no household law to govern her now
if any habits ever had time to fix upon her they would have operated here
habits are peculiar things
they will drive the really nonreligious mind out of bed to say prayers that are only a custom and not a devotion
the victim of habit when he has neglected the thing which it was his custom to do feels a little scratching in the brain a little irritating something which comes of being out of the rut and imagines it to be the prick of conscience the still small voice that is urging him ever to righteousness
if the digression is unusual enough the drag of habit will be heavy enough to cause the unreasoning victim to return and perform the perfunctory thing
now bless me says such a mind i have done my duty when as a matter of fact it has merely done its old unbreakable trick once again
carrie had no excellent home principles fixed upon her
if she had she would have been more consciously distressed
now the lunch went off with considerable warmth
under the influence of the varied occurrences the fine invisible passion which was emanating from drouet the food the still unusual luxury she relaxed and heard with open ears
she was again the victim of the citys hypnotic influence
well said drouet at last we had better be going they had been dawdling over the dishes and their eyes had frequently met
carrie could not help but feel the vibration of force which followed which indeed was his gaze
he had a way of touching her hand in explanation as if to impress a fact upon her
he touched it now as he spoke of going
they arose and went out into the street
the downtown section was now bare save for a few whistling strollers a few owl cars a few open resorts whose windows were still bright
out wabash avenue they strolled drouet still pouring forth his volume of small information
he had carries arm in his and held it closely as he explained
once in a while after some witticism he would look down and his eyes would meet hers
at last they came to the steps and carrie stood up on the first one her head now coming even with his own
he took her hand and held it genially
he looked steadily at her as she glanced about warmly musing
at about that hour minnie was soundly sleeping after a long evening of troubled thought
she had her elbow in an awkward position under her side
the muscles so held irritated a few nerves and now a vague scene floated in on the drowsy mind
she fancied she and carrie were somewhere beside an old coalmine
she could see the tall runway and the heap of earth and coal cast out
there was a deep pit into which they were looking they could see the curious wet stones far down where the wall disappeared in vague shadows
an old basket used for descending was hanging there fastened by a worn rope
lets get in said carrie
oh no said minnie
yes come on said carrie
she began to pull the basket over and now in spite of all protest she had swung over and was going down
carrie she called carrie come back but carrie was far down now and the shadow had swallowed her completely
she moved her arm
now the mystic scenery merged queerly and the place was by waters she had never seen
they were upon some board or ground or something that reached far out and at the end of this was carrie
they looked about and now the thing was sinking and minnie heard the low sip of the encroaching water
come on carrie she called but carrie was reaching farther out
she seemed to recede and now it was difficult to call to her
carrie she called carrie but her own voice sounded far away and the strange waters were blurring everything
she came away suffering as though she had lost something
she was more inexpressibly sad than she had ever been in life
it was this way through many shifts of the tired brain those curious phantoms of the spirit slipping in blurring strange scenes one with the other
the last one made her cry out for carrie was slipping away somewhere over a rock and her fingers had let loose and she had seen her falling
minnie
whats the matter
here wake up said hanson disturbed and shaking her by the shoulder
whawhats the matter said minnie drowsily
wake up he said and turn over
youre talking in your sleep a week or so later drouet strolled into fitzgerald and moys spruce in dress and manner
hello charley said hurstwood looking out from his office door
drouet strolled over and looked in upon the manager at his desk
when do you go out on the road again he inquired
pretty soon said drouet
havent seen much of you this trip said hurstwood
well ive been busy said drouet
they talked some few minutes on general topics
say said drouet as if struck by a sudden idea i want you to come out some evening out where inquired hurstwood
out to my house of course said drouet smiling
hurstwood looked up quizzically the least suggestion of a smile hovering about his lips
he studied the face of drouet in his wise way and then with the demeanour of a gentleman said certainly glad to well have a nice game of euchre may i bring a nice little bottle of sec asked hurstwood
certainly said drouet
ill introduce you chapter ix
conventions own tinderbox the eye that is green hurstwoods residence on the north side near lincoln park was a brick building of a very popular type then a threestory affair with the first floor sunk a very little below the level of the street
it had a large bay window bulging out from the second floor and was graced in front by a small grassy plot twentyfive feet wide and ten feet deep
there was also a small rear yard walled in by the fences of the neighbours and holding a stable where he kept his horse and trap
the ten rooms of the house were occupied by himself his wife julia and his son and daughter george jr and jessica
there were besides these a maidservant represented from time to time by girls of various extraction for mrs hurstwood was not always easy to please
george i let mary go yesterday was not an unfrequent salutation at the dinner table
all right was his only reply
he had long since wearied of discussing the rancorous subject
a lovely home atmosphere is one of the flowers of the world than which there is nothing more tender nothing more delicate nothing more calculated to make strong and just the natures cradled and nourished within it
those who have never experienced such a beneficent influence will not understand wherefore the tear springs glistening to the eyelids at some strange breath in lovely music
the mystic chords which bind and thrill the heart of the nation they will never know
hurstwoods residence could scarcely be said to be infused with this home spirit
it lacked that toleration and regard without which the home is nothing
there was fine furniture arranged as soothingly as the artistic perception of the occupants warranted
there were soft rugs rich upholstered chairs and divans a grand piano a marble carving of some unknown venus by some unknown artist and a number of small bronzes gathered from heaven knows where but generally sold by the large furniture houses along with everything else which goes to make the perfectly appointed house in the diningroom stood a sideboard laden with glistening decanters and other utilities and ornaments in glass the arrangement of which could not be questioned
here was something hurstwood knew about
he had studied the subject for years in his business
he took no little satisfaction in telling each mary shortly after she arrived something of what the art of the thing required
he was not garrulous by any means
on the contrary there was a fine reserve in his manner toward the entire domestic economy of his life which was all that is comprehended by the popular term gentlemanly
he would not argue he would not talk freely
in his manner was something of the dogmatist
what he could not correct he would ignore
there was a tendency in him to walk away from the impossible thing
there was a time when he had been considerably enamoured of his jessica especially when he was younger and more confined in his success
now however in her seventeenth year jessica had developed a certain amount of reserve and independence which was not inviting to the richest form of parental devotion
she was in the high school and had notions of life which were decidedly those of a patrician
she liked nice clothes and urged for them constantly
thoughts of love and elegant individual establishments were running in her head
she met girls at the high school whose parents were truly rich and whose fathers had standing locally as partners or owners of solid businesses
these girls gave themselves the airs befitting the thriving domestic establishments from whence they issued
they were the only ones of the school about whom jessica concerned herself
young hurstwood jr was in his twentieth year and was already connected in a promising capacity with a large real estate firm
he contributed nothing for the domestic expenses of the family but was thought to be saving his money to invest in real estate
he had some ability considerable vanity and a love of pleasure that had not as yet infringed upon his duties whatever they were
he came in and went out pursuing his own plans and fancies addressing a few words to his mother occasionally relating some little incident to his father but for the most part confining himself to those generalities with which most conversation concerns itself
he was not laying bare his desires for any one to see
he did not find any one in the house who particularly cared to see
mrs hurstwood was the type of woman who has ever endeavoured to shine and has been more or less chagrined at the evidences of superior capability in this direction elsewhere
her knowledge of life extended to that little conventional round of society of which she was notbut longed to bea member
she was not without realisation already that this thing was impossible so far as she was concerned
for her daughter she hoped better things
through jessica she might rise a little
through george jrs possible success she might draw to herself the privilege of pointing proudly
even hurstwood was doing well enough and she was anxious that his small real estate adventures should prosper
his property holdings as yet were rather small but his income was pleasing and his position with fitzgerald and moy was fixed
both those gentlemen were on pleasant and rather informal terms with him
the atmosphere which such personalities would create must be apparent to all
it worked out in a thousand little conversations all of which were of the same calibre
im going up to fox lake tomorrow announced george jr at the dinner table one friday evening
whats going on up there queried mrs hurstwood
eddie fahrways got a new steam launch and he wants me to come up and see how it works how much did it cost him asked his mother
oh over two thousand dollars
he says its a dandy old fahrway must be making money put in hurstwood
he is i guess
jack told me they were shipping vegacura to australia nowsaid they sent a whole box to cape town last week just think of that said mrs hurstwood and only four years ago they had that basement in madison street jack told me they were going to put up a sixstory building next spring in robey street just think of that said jessica
on this particular occasion hurstwood wished to leave early
i guess ill be going down town he remarked rising
are we going to mcvickers monday questioned mrs hurstwood without rising
yes he said indifferently
they went on dining while he went upstairs for his hat and coat
presently the door clicked
i guess papas gone said jessica
the latters school news was of a particular stripe
theyre going to give a performance in the lyceum upstairs she reported one day and im going to be in it are you said her mother
yes and ill have to have a new dress
some of the nicest girls in the school are going to be in it
miss palmer is going to take the part of portia is she said mrs hurstwood
theyve got that martha griswold in it again
she thinks she can act her family doesnt amount to anything does it said mrs hurstwood sympathetically
they havent anything have they no returned jessica theyre poor as church mice she distinguished very carefully between the young boys of the school many of whom were attracted by her beauty
what do you think she remarked to her mother one evening that herbert crane tried to make friends with me who is he my dear inquired mrs hurstwood
oh no one said jessica pursing her pretty lips
hes just a student there
he hasnt anything the other half of this picture came when young blyford son of blyford the soap manufacturer walked home with her
mrs hurstwood was on the third floor sitting in a rockingchair reading and happened to look out at the time
who was that with you jessica she inquired as jessica came upstairs
its mr blyford mamma she replied
is it said mrs hurstwood
yes and he wants me to stroll over into the park with him explained jessica a little flushed with running up the stairs
all right my dear said mrs hurstwood
dont be gone long as the two went down the street she glanced interestedly out of the window
it was a most satisfactory spectacle indeed most satisfactory
in this atmosphere hurstwood had moved for a number of years not thinking deeply concerning it
his was not the order of nature to trouble for something better unless the better was immediately and sharply contrasted
as it was he received and gave irritated sometimes by the little displays of selfish indifference pleased at times by some show of finery which supposedly made for dignity and social distinction
the life of the resort which he managed was his life
there he spent most of his time
when he went home evenings the house looked nice
with rare exceptions the meals were acceptable being the kind that an ordinary servant can arrange
in part he was interested in the talk of his son and daughter who always looked well
the vanity of mrs hurstwood caused her to keep her person rather showily arrayed but to hurstwood this was much better than plainness
there was no love lost between them
there was no great feeling of dissatisfaction
her opinion on any subject was not startling
they did not talk enough together to come to the argument of any one point
in the accepted and popular phrase she had her ideas and he had his
once in a while he would meet a woman whose youth sprightliness and humour would make his wife seem rather deficient by contrast but the temporary dissatisfaction which such an encounter might arouse would be counterbalanced by his social position and a certain matter of policy
he could not complicate his home life because it might affect his relations with his employers
they wanted no scandals
a man to hold his position must have a dignified manner a clean record a respectable home anchorage
therefore he was circumspect in all he did and whenever he appeared in the public ways in the afternoon or on sunday it was with his wife and sometimes his children
he would visit the local resorts or those near by in wisconsin and spend a few stiff polished days strolling about conventional places doing conventional things
he knew the need of it
when some one of the many middleclass individuals whom he knew who had money would get into trouble he would shake his head
it didnt do to talk about those things
if it came up for discussion among such friends as with him passed for close he would deprecate the folly of the thing
it was all right to do itall men do those thingsbut why wasnt he careful
a man cant be too careful he lost sympathy for the man that made a mistake and was found out
on this account he still devoted some time to showing his wife abouttime which would have been wearisome indeed if it had not been for the people he would meet and the little enjoyments which did not depend upon her presence or absence
he watched her with considerable curiosity at times for she was still attractive in a way and men looked at her
she was affable vain subject to flattery and this combination he knew quite well might produce a tragedy in a woman of her home position
owing to his order of mind his confidence in the sex was not great
his wife never possessed the virtues which would win the confidence and admiration of a man of his nature
as long as she loved him vigorously he could see how confidence could be but when that was no longer the binding chainwell something might happen
during the last year or two the expenses of the family seemed a large thing
jessica wanted fine clothes and mrs hurstwood not to be outshone by her daughter also frequently enlivened her apparel
hurstwood had said nothing in the past but one day he murmured
jessica must have a new dress this month said mrs hurstwood one morning
hurstwood was arraying himself in one of his perfection vests before the glass at the time
i thought she just bought one he said
that was just something for evening wear returned his wife complacently
it seems to me returned hurstwood that shes spending a good deal for dresses of late well shes going out more concluded his wife but the tone of his voice impressed her as containing something she had not heard there before
he was not a man who traveled much but when he did he had been accustomed to take her along
on one occasion recently a local aldermanic junket had been arranged to visit philadelphiaa junket that was to last ten days
hurstwood had been invited
nobody knows us down there said one a gentleman whose face was a slight improvement over gross ignorance and sensuality
he always wore a silk hat of most imposing proportions
we can have a good time his left eye moved with just the semblance of a wink
you want to come along george the next day hurstwood announced his intention to his wife
im going away julia he said for a few days where she asked looking up
to philadelphia on business she looked at him consciously expecting something else
ill have to leave you behind this time all right she replied but he could see that she was thinking that it was a curious thing
before he went she asked him a few more questions and that irritated him
he began to feel that she was a disagreeable attachment
on this trip he enjoyed himself thoroughly and when it was over he was sorry to get back
he was not willingly a prevaricator and hated thoroughly to make explanations concerning it
the whole incident was glossed over with general remarks but mrs hurstwood gave the subject considerable thought
she drove out more dressed better and attended theatres freely to make up for it
such an atmosphere could hardly come under the category of home life
it ran along by force of habit by force of conventional opinion
with the lapse of time it must necessarily become dryer and dryermust eventually be tinder easily lighted and destroyed
chapter x
the counsel of winter fortunes ambassador calls in the light of the worlds attitude toward woman and her duties the nature of carries mental state deserves consideration
actions such as hers are measured by an arbitrary scale
society possesses a conventional standard whereby it judges all things
all men should be good all women virtuous
wherefore villain hast thou failed
for all the liberal analysis of spencer and our modern naturalistic philosophers we have but an infantile perception of morals
there is more in the subject than mere conformity to a law of evolution
it is yet deeper than conformity to things of earth alone
it is more involved than we as yet perceive
answer first why the heart thrills explain wherefore some plaintive note goes wandering about the world undying make clear the roses subtle alchemy evolving its ruddy lamp in light and rain
in the essence of these facts lie the first principles of morals
oh thought drouet how delicious is my conquest ah thought carrie with mournful misgivings what is it i have lost before this worldold proposition we stand serious interested confused endeavouring to evolve the true theory of moralsthe true answer to what is right
in the view of a certain stratum of society carrie was comfortably establishedin the eyes of the starveling beaten by every wind and gusty sheet of rain she was safe in a halcyon harbour
drouet had taken three rooms furnished in ogden place facing union park on the west side
that was a little greencarpeted breathing spot than which today there is nothing more beautiful in chicago
it afforded a vista pleasant to contemplate
the best room looked out upon the lawn of the park now sear and brown where a little lake lay sheltered
over the bare limbs of the trees which now swayed in the wintry wind rose the steeple of the union park congregational church and far off the towers of several others
the rooms were comfortably enough furnished
there was a good brussels carpet on the floor rich in dull red and lemon shades and representing large jardinires filled with gorgeous impossible flowers
there was a large pierglass mirror between the two windows
a large soft green plushcovered couch occupied one corner and several rockingchairs were set about
some pictures several rugs a few small pieces of bricbrac and the tale of contents is told
in the bedroom off the front room was carries trunk bought by drouet and in the wardrobe built into the wall quite an array of clothingmore than she had ever possessed before and of very becoming designs
there was a third room for possible use as a kitchen where drouet had carrie establish a little portable gas stove for the preparation of small lunches oysters welsh rarebits and the like of which he was exceedingly fond and lastly a bath
the whole place was cosey in that it was lighted by gas and heated by furnace registers possessing also a small grate set with an asbestos back a method of cheerful warming which was then first coming into use
by her industry and natural love of order which now developed the place maintained an air pleasing in the extreme
here then was carrie established in a pleasant fashion free of certain difficulties which most ominously confronted her laden with many new ones which were of a mental order and altogether so turned about in all of her earthly relationships that she might well have been a new and different individual
she looked into her glass and saw a prettier carrie than she had seen before she looked into her mind a mirror prepared of her own and the worlds opinions and saw a worse
between these two images she wavered hesitating which to believe
my but youre a little beauty drouet was wont to exclaim to her
she would look at him with large pleased eyes
you know it dont you he would continue
oh i dont know she would reply feeling delight in the fact that one should think so hesitating to believe though she really did that she was vain enough to think so much of herself
her conscience however was not a drouet interested to praise
there she heard a different voice with which she argued pleaded excused
it was no just and sapient counsellor in its last analysis
it was only an average little conscience a thing which represented the world her past environment habit convention in a confused way
with it the voice of the people was truly the voice of god
oh thou failure said the voice
why she questioned
look at those about came the whispered answer
look at those who are good
how would they scorn to do what you have done
look at the good girls how will they draw away from such as you when they know you have been weak
you had not tried before you failed it was when carrie was alone looking out across the park that she would be listening to this
it would come infrequentlywhen something else did not interfere when the pleasant side was not too apparent when drouet was not there
it was somewhat clear in utterance at first but never wholly convincing
there was always an answer always the december days threatened
she was alone she was desireful she was fearful of the whistling wind
the voice of want made answer for her
once the bright days of summer pass by a city takes on that sombre garb of grey wrapt in which it goes about its labours during the long winter
its endless buildings look grey its sky and its streets assume a sombre hue the scattered leafless trees and windblown dust and paper but add to the general solemnity of colour
there seems to be something in the chill breezes which scurry through the long narrow thoroughfares productive of rueful thoughts
not poets alone nor artists nor that superior order of mind which arrogates to itself all refinement feel this but dogs and all men
these feel as much as the poet though they have not the same power of expression
the sparrow upon the wire the cat in the doorway the dray horse tugging his weary load feel the long keen breaths of winter
it strikes to the heart of all life animate and inanimate
if it were not for the artificial fires of merriment the rush of profitseeking trade and pleasureselling amusements if the various merchants failed to make the customary display within and without their establishments if our streets were not strung with signs of gorgeous hues and thronged with hurrying purchasers we would quickly discover how firmly the chill hand of winter lays upon the heart how dispiriting are the days during which the sun withholds a portion of our allowance of light and warmth
we are more dependent upon these things than is often thought
we are insects produced by heat and pass without it
in the drag of such a grey day the secret voice would reassert itself feebly and more feebly
such mental conflict was not always uppermost
carrie was not by any means a gloomy soul
more she had not the mind to get firm hold upon a definite truth
when she could not find her way out of the labyrinth of illlogic which thought upon the subject created she would turn away entirely
drouet all the time was conducting himself in a model way for one of his sort
he took her about a great deal spent money upon her and when he travelled took her with him
there were times when she would be alone for two or three days while he made the shorter circuits of his business but as a rule she saw a great deal of him
say carrie he said one morning shortly after they had so established themselves ive invited my friend hurstwood to come out some day and spend the evening with us who is he asked carrie doubtfully
oh hes a nice man
hes manager of fitzgerald and moys whats that said carrie
the finest resort in town
its a wayup swell place carrie puzzled a moment
she was wondering what drouet had told him what her attitude would be
thats all right said drouet feeling her thought
he doesnt know anything
youre mrs drouet now there was something about this which struck carrie as slightly inconsiderate
she could see that drouet did not have the keenest sensibilities
why dont we get married she inquired thinking of the voluble promises he had made
well we will he said just as soon as i get this little deal of mine closed up he was referring to some property which he said he had and which required so much attention adjustment and what not that somehow or other it interfered with his free moral personal actions
just as soon as i get back from my denver trip in january well do it carrie accepted this as basis for hopeit was a sort of salve to her conscience a pleasant way out
under the circumstances things would be righted
her actions would be justified
she really was not enamoured of drouet
she was more clever than he
in a dim way she was beginning to see where he lacked
if it had not been for this if she had not been able to measure and judge him in a way she would have been worse off than she was
she would have adored him
she would have been utterly wretched in her fear of not gaining his affection of losing his interest of being swept away and left without an anchorage
as it was she wavered a little slightly anxious at first to gain him completely but later feeling at ease in waiting
she was not exactly sure what she thought of himwhat she wanted to do
when hurstwood called she met a man who was more clever than drouet in a hundred ways
he paid that peculiar deference to women which every member of the sex appreciates
he was not overawed he was not overbold
his great charm was attentiveness
schooled in winning those birds of fine feather among his own sex the merchants and professionals who visited his resort he could use even greater tact when endeavouring to prove agreeable to some one who charmed him
in a pretty woman of any refinement of feeling whatsoever he found his greatest incentive
he was mild placid assured giving the impression that he wished to be of service onlyto do something which would make the lady more pleased
drouet had ability in this line himself when the game was worth the candle but he was too much the egotist to reach the polish which hurstwood possessed
he was too buoyant too full of ruddy life too assured
he succeeded with many who were not quite schooled in the art of love
he failed dismally where the woman was slightly experienced and possessed innate refinement
in the case of carrie he found a woman who was all of the latter but none of the former
he was lucky in the fact that opportunity tumbled into his lap as it were
a few years later with a little more experience the slightest tide of success and he had not been able to approach carrie at all
you ought to have a piano here drouet said hurstwood smiling at carrie on the evening in question so that your wife could play drouet had not thought of that
so we ought he observed readily
oh i dont play ventured carrie
it isnt very difficult returned hurstwood
you could do very well in a few weeks he was in the best form for entertaining this evening
his clothes were particularly new and rich in appearance
the coat lapels stood out with that medium stiffness which excellent cloth possesses
the vest was of a rich scotch plaid set with a double row of round motherofpearl buttons
his cravat was a shiny combination of silken threads not loud not inconspicuous
what he wore did not strike the eye so forcibly as that which drouet had on but carrie could see the elegance of the material
hurstwoods shoes were of soft black calf polished only to a dull shine
drouet wore patent leather but carrie could not help feeling that there was a distinction in favour of the soft leather where all else was so rich
she noticed these things almost unconsciously
they were things which would naturally flow from the situation
she was used to drouets appearance
suppose we have a little game of euchre suggested hurstwood after a light round of conversation
he was rather dexterous in avoiding everything that would suggest that he knew anything of carries past
he kept away from personalities altogether and confined himself to those things which did not concern individuals at all
by his manner he put carrie at her ease and by his deference and pleasantries he amused her
he pretended to be seriously interested in all she said
i dont know how to play said carrie
charlie you are neglecting a part of your duty he observed to drouet most affably
between us though he went on we can show you by his tact he made drouet feel that he admired his choice
there was something in his manner that showed that he was pleased to be there
drouet felt really closer to him than ever before
it gave him more respect for carrie
her appearance came into a new light under hurstwoods appreciation
the situation livened considerably
now let me see said hurstwood looking over carries shoulder very deferentially
what have you he studied for a moment
thats rather good he said
youre lucky
now ill show you how to trounce your husband
you take my advice here said drouet if you two are going to scheme together i wont stand a ghost of a show
hurstwoods a regular sharp no its your wife
she brings me luck
why shouldnt she win carrie looked gratefully at hurstwood and smiled at drouet
the former took the air of a mere friend
he was simply there to enjoy himself
anything that carrie did was pleasing to him nothing more
there he said holding back one of his own good cards and giving carrie a chance to take a trick
i count that clever playing for a beginner the latter laughed gleefully as she saw the hand coming her way
it was as if she were invincible when hurstwood helped her
he did not look at her often
when he did it was with a mild light in his eye
not a shade was there of anything save geniality and kindness
he took back the shifty clever gleam and replaced it with one of innocence
carrie could not guess but that it was pleasure with him in the immediate thing
she felt that he considered she was doing a great deal
its unfair to let such playing go without earning something he said after a time slipping his finger into the little coin pocket of his coat
lets play for dimes all right said drouet fishing for bills
hurstwood was quicker
his fingers were full of new tencent pieces
here we are he said supplying each one with a little stack
oh this is gambling smiled carrie
its bad no said drouet only fun
if you never play for more than that you will go to heaven dont you moralise said hurstwood to carrie gently until you see what becomes of the money drouet smiled
if your husband gets them hell tell you how bad it is drouet laughed loud
there was such an ingratiating tone about hurstwoods voice the insinuation was so perceptible that even carrie got the humour of it
when do you leave said hurstwood to drouet
on wednesday he replied
its rather hard to have your husband running about like that isnt it said hurstwood addressing carrie
shes going along with me this time said drouet
you must both go with me to the theatre before you go certainly said drouet
eh carrie id like it ever so much she replied
hurstwood did his best to see that carrie won the money
he rejoiced in her success kept counting her winnings and finally gathered and put them in her extended hand
they spread a little lunch at which he served the wine and afterwards he used fine tact in going
now he said addressing first carrie and then drouet with his eyes you must be ready at
ill come and get you they went with him to the door and there was his cab waiting its red lamps gleaming cheerfully in the shadow
now he observed to drouet with a tone of goodfellowship when you leave your wife alone you must let me show her around a little
it will break up her loneliness sure said drouet quite pleased at the attention shown
youre so kind observed carrie
not at all said hurstwood i would want your husband to do as much for me he smiled and went lightly away
carrie was thoroughly impressed
she had never come in contact with such grace
as for drouet he was equally pleased
theres a nice man he remarked to carrie as they returned to their cosey chamber
a good friend of mine too he seems to be said carrie
chapter xi
the persuasion of fashion feeling guards oer its own carrie was an apt student of fortunes waysof fortunes superficialities
seeing a thing she would immediately set to inquiring how she would look properly related to it
be it known that this is not fine feeling it is not wisdom
the greatest minds are not so afflicted and on the contrary the lowest order of mind is not so disturbed
fine clothes to her were a vast persuasion they spoke tenderly and jesuitically for themselves
when she came within earshot of their pleading desire in her bent a willing ear
the voice of the socalled inanimate
who shall translate for us the language of the stones
my dear said the lace collar she secured from partridges i fit you beautifully dont give me up ah such little feet said the leather of the soft new shoes how effectively i cover them
what a pity they should ever want my aid once these things were in her hand on her person she might dream of giving them up the method by which they came might intrude itself so forcibly that she would ache to be rid of the thought of it but she would not give them up
put on the old clothesthat torn pair of shoes was called to her by her conscience in vain
she could possibly have conquered the fear of hunger and gone back the thought of hard work and a narrow round of suffering would under the last pressure of conscience have yielded but spoil her appearancebe oldclothed and poorappearingnever
drouet heightened her opinion on this and allied subjects in such a manner as to weaken her power of resisting their influence
it is so easy to do this when the thing opined is in the line of what we desire
in his hearty way he insisted upon her good looks
he looked at her admiringly and she took it at its full value
under the circumstances she did not need to carry herself as pretty women do
she picked that knowledge up fast enough for herself
drouet had a habit characteristic of his kind of looking after stylishly dressed or pretty women on the street and remarking upon them
he had just enough of the feminine love of dress to be a good judgenot of intellect but of clothes
he saw how they set their little feet how they carried their chins with what grace and sinuosity they swung their bodies
a dainty selfconscious swaying of the hips by a woman was to him as alluring as the glint of rare wine to a toper
he would turn and follow the disappearing vision with his eyes
he would thrill as a child with the unhindered passion that was in him
he loved the thing that women love in themselves grace
at this their own shrine he knelt with them an ardent devotee
did you see that woman who went by just now he said to carrie on the first day they took a walk together
fine stepper wasnt she carrie looked and observed the grace commended
yes she is she returned cheerfully a little suggestion of possible defect in herself awakening in her mind
if that was so fine she must look at it more closely
instinctively she felt a desire to imitate it
surely she could do that too
when one of her mind sees many things emphasized and reemphasized and admired she gathers the logic of it and applies accordingly
drouet was not shrewd enough to see that this was not tactful
he could not see that it would be better to make her feel that she was competing with herself not others better than herself
he would not have done it with an older wiser woman but in carrie he saw only the novice
less clever than she he was naturally unable to comprehend her sensibility
he went on educating and wounding her a thing rather foolish in one whose admiration for his pupil and victim was apt to grow
carrie took the instructions affably
she saw what drouet liked in a vague way she saw where he was weak
it lessens a womans opinion of a man when she learns that his admiration is so pointedly and generously distributed
she sees but one object of supreme compliment in this world and that is herself
if a man is to succeed with many women he must be all in all to each
in her own apartments carrie saw things which were lessons in the same school
in the same house with her lived an official of one of the theatres mr frank a hale manager of the standard and his wife a pleasinglooking brunette of thirtyfive
they were people of a sort very common in america today who live respectably from hand to mouth
hale received a salary of fortyfive dollars a week
his wife quite attractive affected the feeling of youth and objected to that sort of home life which means the care of a house and the raising of a family
like drouet and carrie they also occupied three rooms on the floor above
not long after she arrived mrs hale established social relations with her and together they went about
for a long time this was her only companionship and the gossip of the managers wife formed the medium through which she saw the world
such trivialities such praises of wealth such conventional expression of morals as sifted through this passive creatures mind fell upon carrie and for the while confused her
on the other hand her own feelings were a corrective influence
the constant drag to something better was not to be denied
by those things which address the heart was she steadily recalled
in the apartments across the hall were a young girl and her mother
they were from evansville indiana the wife and daughter of a railroad treasurer
the daughter was here to study music the mother to keep her company
carrie did not make their acquaintance but she saw the daughter coming in and going out
a few times she had seen her at the piano in the parlour and not infrequently had heard her play
this young woman was particularly dressy for her station and wore a jewelled ring or two which flashed upon her white fingers as she played
now carrie was affected by music
her nervous composition responded to certain strains much as certain strings of a harp vibrate when a corresponding key of a piano is struck
she was delicately moulded in sentiment and answered with vague ruminations to certain wistful chords
they awoke longings for those things which she did not have
they caused her to cling closer to things she possessed
one short song the young lady played in a most soulful and tender mood
carrie heard it through the open door from the parlour below
it was at that hour between afternoon and night when for the idle the wanderer things are apt to take on a wistful aspect
the mind wanders forth on far journeys and returns with sheaves of withered and departed joys
carrie sat at her window looking out
drouet had been away since ten in the morning
she had amused herself with a walk a book by bertha m clay which drouet had left there though she did not wholly enjoy the latter and by changing her dress for the evening
now she sat looking out across the park as wistful and depressed as the nature which craves variety and life can be under such circumstances
as she contemplated her new state the strain from the parlour below stole upward
with it her thoughts became coloured and enmeshed
she reverted to the things which were best and saddest within the small limit of her experience
she became for the moment a repentant
while she was in this mood drouet came in bringing with him an entirely different atmosphere
it was dusk and carrie had neglected to light the lamp
the fire in the grate too had burned low
where are you cad he said using a pet name he had given her
here she answered
there was something delicate and lonely in her voice but he could not hear it
he had not the poetry in him that would seek a woman out under such circumstances and console her for the tragedy of life
instead he struck a match and lighted the gas
hello he exclaimed youve been crying her eyes were still wet with a few vague tears
pshaw he said you dont want to do that he took her hand feeling in his goodnatured egotism that it was probably lack of his presence which had made her lonely
come on now he went on its all right
lets waltz a little to that music he could not have introduced a more incongruous proposition
it made clear to carrie that he could not sympathise with her
she could not have framed thoughts which would have expressed his defect or made clear the difference between them but she felt it
it was his first great mistake
what drouet said about the girls grace as she tripped out evenings accompanied by her mother caused carrie to perceive the nature and value of those little modish ways which women adopt when they would presume to be something
she looked in the mirror and pursed up her lips accompanying it with a little toss of the head as she had seen the railroad treasurers daughter do
she caught up her skirts with an easy swing for had not drouet remarked that in her and several others and carrie was naturally imitative
she began to get the hang of those little things which the pretty woman who has vanity invariably adopts
in short her knowledge of grace doubled and with it her appearance changed
she became a girl of considerable taste
drouet noticed this
he saw the new bow in her hair and the new way of arranging her locks which she affected one morning
you look fine that way cad he said
do i she replied sweetly
it made her try for other effects that selfsame day
she used her feet less heavily a thing that was brought about by her attempting to imitate the treasurers daughters graceful carriage
how much influence the presence of that young woman in the same house had upon her it would be difficult to say
but because of all these things when hurstwood called he had found a young woman who was much more than the carrie to whom drouet had first spoken
the primary defects of dress and manner had passed
she was pretty graceful rich in the timidity born of uncertainty and with a something childlike in her large eyes which captured the fancy of this starched and conventional poser among men
it was the ancient attraction of the fresh for the stale
if there was a touch of appreciation left in him for the bloom and unsophistication which is the charm of youth it rekindled now
he looked into her pretty face and felt the subtle waves of young life radiating therefrom
in that large clear eye he could see nothing that his blas nature could understand as guile
the little vanity if he could have perceived it there would have touched him as a pleasant thing
i wonder he said as he rode away in his cab how drouet came to win her he gave her credit for feelings superior to drouet at the first glance
the cab plopped along between the farreceding lines of gas lamps on either hand
he folded his gloved hands and saw only the lighted chamber and carries face
he was pondering over the delight of youthful beauty
ill have a bouquet for her he thought
drouet wont mind he never for a moment concealed the fact of her attraction for himself
he troubled himself not at all about drouets priority
he was merely floating those gossamer threads of thought which like the spiders he hoped would lay hold somewhere
he did not know he could not guess what the result would be
a few weeks later drouet in his peregrinations encountered one of his welldressed lady acquaintances in chicago on his return from a short trip to omaha
he had intended to hurry out to ogden place and surprise carrie but now he fell into an interesting conversation and soon modified his original intention
lets go to dinner he said little recking any chance meeting which might trouble his way
certainly said his companion
they visited one of the better restaurants for a social chat
it was five in the afternoon when they met it was seventhirty before the last bone was picked
drouet was just finishing a little incident he was relating and his face was expanding into a smile when hurstwoods eye caught his own
the latter had come in with several friends and seeing drouet and some woman not carrie drew his own conclusion
ah the rascal he thought and then with a touch of righteous sympathy thats pretty hard on the little girl drouet jumped from one easy thought to another as he caught hurstwoods eye
he felt but very little misgiving until he saw that hurstwood was cautiously pretending not to see
then some of the latters impression forced itself upon him
he thought of carrie and their last meeting
by george he would have to explain this to hurstwood
such a chance halfhour with an old friend must not have anything more attached to it than it really warranted
for the first time he was troubled
here was a moral complication of which he could not possibly get the ends
hurstwood would laugh at him for being a fickle boy
he would laugh with hurstwood
carrie would never hear his present companion at table would never know and yet he could not help feeling that he was getting the worst of itthere was some faint stigma attached and he was not guilty
he broke up the dinner by becoming dull and saw his companion on her car
then he went home
he hasnt talked to me about any of these later flames thought hurstwood to himself
he thinks i think he cares for the girl out there he ought not to think im knocking around since i have just introduced him out there thought drouet
i saw you hurstwood said genially the next time drouet drifted in to his polished resort from which he could not stay away
he raised his forefinger indicatively as parents do to children
an old acquaintance of mine that i ran into just as i was coming up from the station explained drouet
she used to be quite a beauty still attracts a little eh returned the other affecting to jest
oh no said drouet just couldnt escape her this time how long are you here asked hurstwood
only a few days you must bring the girl down and take dinner with me he said
im afraid you keep her cooped up out there
ill get a box for joe jefferson not me answered the drummer
sure ill come this pleased hurstwood immensely
he gave drouet no credit for any feelings toward carrie whatever
he envied him and now as he looked at the welldressed jolly salesman whom he so much liked the gleam of the rival glowed in his eye
he began to size up drouet from the standpoints of wit and fascination
he began to look to see where he was weak
there was no disputing that whatever he might think of him as a good fellow he felt a certain amount of contempt for him as a lover
he could hoodwink him all right
why if he would just let carrie see one such little incident as that of thursday it would settle the matter
he ran on in thought almost exulting the while he laughed and chatted and drouet felt nothing
he had no power of analysing the glance and the atmosphere of a man like hurstwood
he stood and smiled and accepted the invitation while his friend examined him with the eye of a hawk
the object of this peculiarly involved comedy was not thinking of either
she was busy adjusting her thoughts and feelings to newer conditions and was not in danger of suffering disturbing pangs from either quarter
one evening drouet found her dressing herself before the glass
cad said he catching her i believe youre getting vain nothing of the kind she returned smiling
well youre mighty pretty he went on slipping his arm around her
put on that navyblue dress of yours and ill take you to the show oh ive promised mrs hale to go with her to the exposition tonight she returned apologetically
you did eh he said studying the situation abstractedly
i wouldnt care to go to that myself well i dont know answered carrie puzzling but not offering to break her promise in his favour
just then a knock came at their door and the maidservant handed a letter in
he says theres an answer expected she explained
its from hurstwood said drouet noting the superscription as he tore it open
you are to come down and see joe jefferson with me tonight it ran in part
its my turn as we agreed the other day
all other bets are off well what do you say to this asked drouet innocently while carries mind bubbled with favourable replies
you had better decide charlie she said reservedly
i guess we had better go if you can break that engagement upstairs said drouet
oh i can returned carrie without thinking
drouet selected writing paper while carrie went to change her dress
she hardly explained to herself why this latest invitation appealed to her most
shall i wear my hair as i did yesterday she asked as she came out with several articles of apparel pending
sure he returned pleasantly
she was relieved to see that he felt nothing
she did not credit her willingness to go to any fascination hurstwood held for her
it seemed that the combination of hurstwood drouet and herself was more agreeable than anything else that had been suggested
she arrayed herself most carefully and they started off extending excuses upstairs
i say said hurstwood as they came up the theatre lobby we are exceedingly charming this evening carrie fluttered under his approving glance
now then he said leading the way up the foyer into the theatre
if ever there was dressiness it was here
it was the personification of the old term spick and span
did you ever see jefferson he questioned as he leaned toward carrie in the box
i never did she returned
hes delightful delightful he went on giving the commonplace rendition of approval which such men know
he sent drouet after a programme and then discoursed to carrie concerning jefferson as he had heard of him
the former was pleased beyond expression and was really hypnotised by the environment the trappings of the box the elegance of her companion
several times their eyes accidentally met and then there poured into hers such a flood of feeling as she had never before experienced
she could not for the moment explain it for in the next glance or the next move of the hand there was seeming indifference mingled only with the kindest attention
drouet shared in the conversation but he was almost dull in comparison
hurstwood entertained them both and now it was driven into carries mind that here was the superior man
she instinctively felt that he was stronger and higher and yet withal so simple
by the end of the third act she was sure that drouet was only a kindly soul but otherwise defective
he sank every moment in her estimation by the strong comparison
i have had such a nice time said carrie when it was all over and they were coming out
yes indeed added drouet who was not in the least aware that a battle had been fought and his defences weakened
he was like the emperor of china who sat glorying in himself unaware that his fairest provinces were being wrested from him
well you have saved me a dreary evening returned hurstwood
goodnight he took carries little hand and a current of feeling swept from one to the other
im so tired said carrie leaning back in the car when drouet began to talk
well you rest a little while i smoke he said rising and then he foolishly went to the forward platform of the car and left the game as it stood
chapter xii
of the lamps of the mansions the ambassador plea mrs hurstwood was not aware of any of her husbands moral defections though she might readily have suspected his tendencies which she well understood
she was a woman upon whose action under provocation you could never count
hurstwood for one had not the slightest idea of what she would do under certain circumstances
he had never seen her thoroughly aroused
in fact she was not a woman who would fly into a passion
she had too little faith in mankind not to know that they were erring
she was too calculating to jeopardize any advantage she might gain in the way of information by fruitless clamour
her wrath would never wreak itself in one fell blow
she would wait and brood studying the details and adding to them until her power might be commensurate with her desire for revenge
at the same time she would not delay to inflict any injury big or little which would wound the object of her revenge and still leave him uncertain as to the source of the evil
she was a cold selfcentred woman with many a thought of her own which never found expression not even by so much as the glint of an eye
hurstwood felt some of this in her nature though he did not actually perceive it
he dwelt with her in peace and some satisfaction
he did not fear her in the leastthere was no cause for it
she still took a faint pride in him which was augmented by her desire to have her social integrity maintained
she was secretly somewhat pleased by the fact that much of her husbands property was in her name a precaution which hurstwood had taken when his home interests were somewhat more alluring than at present
his wife had not the slightest reason to feel that anything would ever go amiss with their household and yet the shadows which run before gave her a thought of the good of it now and then
she was in a position to become refractory with considerable advantage and hurstwood conducted himself circumspectly because he felt that he could not be sure of anything once she became dissatisfied
it so happened that on the night when hurstwood carrie and drouet were in the box at mcvickars george jr was in the sixth row of the parquet with the daughter of h b carmichael the third partner of a wholesale drygoods house of that city
hurstwood did not see his son for he sat as was his wont as far back as possible leaving himself just partially visible when he bent forward to those within the first six rows in question
it was his wont to sit this way in every theatreto make his personality as inconspicuous as possible where it would be no advantage to him to have it otherwise
he never moved but what if there was any danger of his conduct being misconstrued or illreported he looked carefully about him and counted the cost of every inch of conspicuity
the next morning at breakfast his son said i saw you governor last night were you at mcvickars said hurstwood with the best grace in the world
yes said young george
who with miss carmichael mrs hurstwood directed an inquiring glance at her husband but could not judge from his appearance whether it was any more than a casual look into the theatre which was referred to
how was the play she inquired
very good returned hurstwood only its the same old thing rip van winkle whom did you go with queried his wife with assumed indifference
charlie drouet and his wife
they are friends of moys visiting here owing to the peculiar nature of his position such a disclosure as this would ordinarily create no difficulty
his wife took it for granted that his situation called for certain social movements in which she might not be included
but of late he had pleaded office duty on several occasions when his wife asked for his company to any evening entertainment
he had done so in regard to the very evening in question only the morning before
i thought you were going to be busy she remarked very carefully
so i was he exclaimed
i couldnt help the interruption but i made up for it afterward by working until two this settled the discussion for the time being but there was a residue of opinion which was not satisfactory
there was no time at which the claims of his wife could have been more unsatisfactorily pushed
for years he had been steadily modifying his matrimonial devotion and found her company dull
now that a new light shone upon the horizon this older luminary paled in the west
he was satisfied to turn his face away entirely and any call to look back was irksome
she on the contrary was not at all inclined to accept anything less than a complete fulfilment of the letter of their relationship though the spirit might be wanting
we are coming down town this afternoon she remarked a few days later
i want you to come over to kinsleys and meet mr phillips and his wife
theyre stopping at the tremont and were going to show them around a little after the occurrence of wednesday he could not refuse though the phillips were about as uninteresting as vanity and ignorance could make them
he agreed but it was with short grace
he was angry when he left the house
ill put a stop to this he thought
im not going to be bothered fooling around with visitors when i have work to do not long after this mrs hurstwood came with a similar proposition only it was to a matine this time
my dear he returned i havent time
im too busy you find time to go with other people though she replied with considerable irritation
nothing of the kind he answered
i cant avoid business relations and thats all there is to it well never mind she exclaimed
her lips tightened
the feeling of mutual antagonism was increased
on the other hand his interest in drouets little shopgirl grew in an almost evenly balanced proportion
that young lady under the stress of her situation and the tutelage of her new friend changed effectively
she had the aptitude of the struggler who seeks emancipation
the glow of a more showy life was not lost upon her
she did not grow in knowledge so much as she awakened in the matter of desire
mrs hales extended harangues upon the subjects of wealth and position taught her to distinguish between degrees of wealth
mrs hale loved to drive in the afternoon in the sun when it was fine and to satisfy her soul with a sight of those mansions and lawns which she could not afford
on the north side had been erected a number of elegant mansions along what is now known as the north shore drive
the present lake wall of stone and granitoid was not then in place but the road had been well laid out the intermediate spaces of lawn were lovely to look upon and the houses were thoroughly new and imposing
when the winter season had passed and the first fine days of the early spring appeared mrs hale secured a buggy for an afternoon and invited carrie
they rode first through lincoln park and on far out towards evanston turning back at four and arriving at the north end of the shore drive at about five oclock
at this time of year the days are still comparatively short and the shadows of the evening were beginning to settle down upon the great city
lamps were beginning to burn with that mellow radiance which seems almost watery and translucent to the eye
there was a softness in the air which speaks with an infinite delicacy of feeling to the flesh as well as to the soul
carrie felt that it was a lovely day
she was ripened by it in spirit for many suggestions
as they drove along the smooth pavement an occasional carriage passed
she saw one stop and the footman dismount opening the door for a gentleman who seemed to be leisurely returning from some afternoon pleasure
across the broad lawns now first freshening into green she saw lamps faintly glowing upon rich interiors
now it was but a chair now a table now an ornate corner which met her eye but it appealed to her as almost nothing else could
such childish fancies as she had had of fairy palaces and kingly quarters now came back
she imagined that across these richly carved entranceways where the globed and crystalled lamps shone upon panelled doors set with stained and designed panes of glass was neither care nor unsatisfied desire
she was perfectly certain that here was happiness
if she could but stroll up yon broad walk cross that rich entranceway which to her was of the beauty of a jewel and sweep in grace and luxury to possession and commandoh
how quickly would sadness flee how in an instant would the heartache end
she gazed and gazed wondering delighting longing and all the while the siren voice of the unrestful was whispering in her ear
if we could have such a home as that said mrs hale sadly how delightful it would be and yet they do say said carrie that no one is ever happy she had heard so much of the canting philosophy of the grapeless fox
i notice said mrs hale that they all try mighty hard though to take their misery in a mansion when she came to her own rooms carrie saw their comparative insignificance
she was not so dull but that she could perceive they were but three small rooms in a moderately wellfurnished boardinghouse
she was not contrasting it now with what she had had but what she had so recently seen
the glow of the palatial doors was still in her eye the roll of cushioned carriages still in her ears
what after all was drouet
what was she
at her window she thought it over rocking to and fro and gazing out across the lamplit park toward the lamplit houses on warren and ashland avenues
she was too wrought up to care to go down to eat too pensive to do aught but rock and sing
some old tunes crept to her lips and as she sang them her heart sank
she longed and longed and longed
it was now for the old cottage room in columbia city now the mansion upon the shore drive now the fine dress of some lady now the elegance of some scene
she was sad beyond measure and yet uncertain wishing fancying
finally it seemed as if all her state was one of loneliness and forsakenness and she could scarce refrain from trembling at the lip
she hummed and hummed as the moments went by sitting in the shadow by the window and was therein as happy though she did not perceive it as she ever would be
while carrie was still in this frame of mind the houseservant brought up the intelligence that mr hurstwood was in the parlour asking to see mr and mrs drouet
i guess he doesnt know that charlie is out of town thought carrie
she had seen comparatively little of the manager during the winter but had been kept constantly in mind of him by one thing and another principally by the strong impression he had made
she was quite disturbed for the moment as to her appearance but soon satisfied herself by the aid of the mirror and went below
hurstwood was in his best form as usual
he hadnt heard that drouet was out of town
he was but slightly affected by the intelligence and devoted himself to the more general topics which would interest carrie
it was surprisingthe ease with which he conducted a conversation
he was like every man who has had the advantage of practice and knows he has sympathy
he knew that carrie listened to him pleasurably and without the least effort he fell into a train of observation which absorbed her fancy
he drew up his chair and modulated his voice to such a degree that what he said seemed wholly confidential
he confined himself almost exclusively to his observation of men and pleasures
he had been here and there he had seen this and that
somehow he made carrie wish to see similar things and all the while kept her aware of himself
she could not shut out the consciousness of his individuality and presence for a moment
he would raise his eyes slowly in smiling emphasis of something and she was fixed by their magnetism
he would draw out with the easiest grace her approval
once he touched her hand for emphasis and she only smiled
he seemed to radiate an atmosphere which suffused her being
he was never dull for a minute and seemed to make her clever
at least she brightened under his influence until all her best side was exhibited
she felt that she was more clever with him than with others
at least he seemed to find so much in her to applaud
there was not the slightest touch of patronage
drouet was full of it
there had been something so personal so subtle in each meeting between them both when drouet was present and when he was absent that carrie could not speak of it without feeling a sense of difficulty
she was no talker
she could never arrange her thoughts in fluent order
it was always a matter of feeling with her strong and deep
each time there had been no sentence of importance which she could relate and as for the glances and sensations what woman would reveal them
such things had never been between her and drouet
as a matter of fact they could never be
she had been dominated by distress and the enthusiastic forces of relief which drouet represented at an opportune moment when she yielded to him
now she was persuaded by secret current feelings which drouet had never understood
hurstwoods glance was as effective as the spoken words of a lover and more
they called for no immediate decision and could not be answered
people in general attach too much importance to words
they are under the illusion that talking effects great results
as a matter of fact words are as a rule the shallowest portion of all the argument
they but dimly represent the great surging feelings and desires which lie behind
when the distraction of the tongue is removed the heart listens
in this conversation she heard instead of his words the voices of the things which he represented
how suave was the counsel of his appearance
how feelingly did his superior state speak for itself
the growing desire he felt for her lay upon her spirit as a gentle hand
she did not need to tremble at all because it was invisible she did not need to worry over what other people would saywhat she herself would saybecause it had no tangibility
she was being pleaded with persuaded led into denying old rights and assuming new ones and yet there were no words to prove it
such conversation as was indulged in held the same relationship to the actual mental enactments of the twain that the low music of the orchestra does to the dramatic incident which it is used to cover
have you ever seen the houses along the lake shore on the north side asked hurstwood
why i was just over there this afternoonmrs
hale and i arent they beautiful theyre very fine he answered
oh me said carrie pensively
i wish i could live in such a place youre not happy said hurstwood slowly after a slight pause
he had raised his eyes solemnly and was looking into her own
he assumed that he had struck a deep chord
now was a slight chance to say a word in his own behalf
he leaned over quietly and continued his steady gaze
he felt the critical character of the period
she endeavoured to stir but it was useless
the whole strength of a mans nature was working
he had good cause to urge him on
he looked and looked and the longer the situation lasted the more difficult it became
the little shopgirl was getting into deep water
she was letting her few supports float away from her
oh she said at last you mustnt look at me like that i cant help it he answered
she relaxed a little and let the situation endure giving him strength
you are not satisfied with life are you no she answered weakly
he saw he was the master of the situationhe felt it
he reached over and touched her hand
you mustnt she exclaimed jumping up
i didnt intend to he answered easily
she did not run away as she might have done
she did not terminate the interview but he drifted off into a pleasant field of thought with the readiest grace
not long after he rose to go and she felt that he was in power
you mustnt feel bad he said kindly things will straighten out in the course of time she made no answer because she could think of nothing to say
we are good friends arent we he said extending his hand
yes she answered
not a word then until i see you again he retained a hold on her hand
i cant promise she said doubtfully
you must be more generous than that he said in such a simple way that she was touched
lets not talk about it any more she returned
all right he said brightening
he went down the steps and into his cab
carrie closed the door and ascended into her room
she undid her broad lace collar before the mirror and unfastened her pretty alligator belt which she had recently bought
im getting terrible she said honestly affected by a feeling of trouble and shame
i dont seem to do anything right she unloosed her hair after a time and let it hang in loose brown waves
her mind was going over the events of the evening
i dont know she murmured at last what i can do well said hurstwood as he rode away she likes me all right that i know the aroused manager whistled merrily for a good four miles to his office an old melody that he had not recalled for fifteen years
chapter xiii
his credentials accepted a babel of tongues it was not quite two days after the scene between carrie and hurstwood in the ogden place parlour before he again put in his appearance
he had been thinking almost uninterruptedly of her
her leniency had in a way inflamed his regard
he felt that he must succeed with her and that speedily
the reason for his interest not to say fascination was deeper than mere desire
it was a flowering out of feelings which had been withering in dry and almost barren soil for many years
it is probable that carrie represented a better order of woman than had ever attracted him before
he had had no love affair since that which culminated in his marriage and since then time and the world had taught him how raw and erroneous was his original judgment
whenever he thought of it he told himself that if he had it to do over again he would never marry such a woman
at the same time his experience with women in general had lessened his respect for the sex
he maintained a cynical attitude well grounded on numerous experiences
such women as he had known were of nearly one type selfish ignorant flashy
the wives of his friends were not inspiring to look upon
his own wife had developed a cold commonplace nature which to him was anything but pleasing
what he knew of that underworld where grovel the beatmen of society and he knew a great deal had hardened his nature
he looked upon most women with suspiciona single eye to the utility of beauty and dress
he followed them with a keen suggestive glance
at the same time he was not so dull but that a good woman commanded his respect
personally he did not attempt to analyse the marvel of a saintly woman
he would take off his hat and would silence the lighttongued and the vicious in her presencemuch as the irish keeper of a bowery hall will humble himself before a sister of mercy and pay toll to charity with a willing and reverent hand
but he would not think much upon the question of why he did so
a man in his situation who comes after a long round of worthless or hardening experiences upon a young unsophisticated innocent soul is apt either to hold aloof out of a sense of his own remoteness or to draw near and become fascinated and elated by his discovery
it is only by a roundabout process that such men ever do draw near such a girl
they have no method no understanding of how to ingratiate themselves in youthful favour save when they find virtue in the toils
if unfortunately the fly has got caught in the net the spider can come forth and talk business upon its own terms
so when maidenhood has wandered into the moil of the city when it is brought within the circle of the rounder and the rou even though it be at the outermost rim they can come forth and use their alluring arts
hurstwood had gone at drouets invitation to meet a new baggage of fine clothes and pretty features
he entered expecting to indulge in an evening of lightsome frolic and then lose track of the newcomer forever
instead he found a woman whose youth and beauty attracted him
in the mild light of carries eye was nothing of the calculation of the mistress
in the diffident manner was nothing of the art of the courtesan
he saw at once that a mistake had been made that some difficult conditions had pushed this troubled creature into his presence and his interest was enlisted
here sympathy sprang to the rescue but it was not unmixed with selfishness
he wanted to win carrie because he thought her fate mingled with his was better than if it were united with drouets
he envied the drummer his conquest as he had never envied any man in all the course of his experience
carrie was certainly better than this man as she was superior mentally to drouet
she came fresh from the air of the village the light of the country still in her eye
here was neither guile nor rapacity
there were slight inherited traits of both in her but they were rudimentary
she was too full of wonder and desire to be greedy
she still looked about her upon the great maze of the city without understanding
hurstwood felt the bloom and the youth
he picked her as he would the fresh fruit of a tree
he felt as fresh in her presence as one who is taken out of the flash of summer to the first cool breath of spring
carrie left alone since the scene in question and having no one with whom to counsel had at first wandered from one strange mental conclusion to another until at last tired out she gave it up
she owed something to drouet she thought
it did not seem more than yesterday that he had aided her when she was worried and distressed
she had the kindliest feelings for him in every way
she gave him credit for his good looks his generous feelings and even in fact failed to recollect his egotism when he was absent but she could not feel any binding influence keeping her for him as against all others
in fact such a thought had never had any grounding even in drouets desires
the truth is that this goodly drummer carried the doom of all enduring relationships in his own lightsome manner and unstable fancy
he went merrily on assured that he was alluring all that affection followed tenderly in his wake that things would endure unchangingly for his pleasure
when he missed some old face or found some door finally shut to him it did not grieve him deeply
he was too young too successful
he would remain thus young in spirit until he was dead
as for hurstwood he was alive with thoughts and feelings concerning carrie
he had no definite plans regarding her but he was determined to make her confess an affection for him
he thought he saw in her drooping eye her unstable glance her wavering manner the symptoms of a budding passion
he wanted to stand near her and make her lay her hand in hishe wanted to find out what her next step would bewhat the next sign of feeling for him would be
such anxiety and enthusiasm had not affected him for years
he was a youth again in feelinga cavalier in action
in his position opportunity for taking his evenings out was excellent
he was a most faithful worker in general and a man who commanded the confidence of his employers in so far as the distribution of his time was concerned
he could take such hours off as he chose for it was well known that he fulfilled his managerial duties successfully whatever time he might take
his grace tact and ornate appearance gave the place an air which was most essential while at the same time his long experience made him a most excellent judge of its stock necessities
bartenders and assistants might come and go singly or in groups but so long as he was present the host of oldtime customers would barely notice the change
he gave the place the atmosphere to which they were used
consequently he arranged his hours very much to suit himself taking now an afternoon now an evening but invariably returning between eleven and twelve to witness the last hour or two of the days business and look after the closing details
you see that things are safe and all the employees are out when you go home george moy had once remarked to him and he never once in all the period of his long service neglected to do this
neither of the owners had for years been in the resort after five in the afternoon and yet their manager as faithfully fulfilled this request as if they had been there regularly to observe
on this friday afternoon scarcely two days after his previous visit he made up his mind to see carrie
he could not stay away longer
evans he said addressing the head barkeeper if any one calls i will be back between four and five he hurried to madison street and boarded a horsecar which carried him to ogden place in half an hour
carrie had thought of going for a walk and had put on a light grey woollen dress with a jaunty doublebreasted jacket
she had out her hat and gloves and was fastening a white lace tie about her throat when the housemaid brought up the information that mr hurstwood wished to see her
she started slightly at the announcement but told the girl to say that she would come down in a moment and proceeded to hasten her dressing
carrie could not have told herself at this moment whether she was glad or sorry that the impressive manager was awaiting her presence
she was slightly flurried and tingling in the cheeks but it was more nervousness than either fear or favour
she did not try to conjecture what the drift of the conversation would be
she only felt that she must be careful and that hurstwood had an indefinable fascination for her
then she gave her tie its last touch with her fingers and went below
the deepfeeling manager was himself a little strained in the nerves by the thorough consciousness of his mission
he felt that he must make a strong play on this occasion but now that the hour was come and he heard carries feet upon the stair his nerve failed him
he sank a little in determination for he was not so sure after all what her opinion might be
when she entered the room however her appearance gave him courage
she looked simple and charming enough to strengthen the daring of any lover
her apparent nervousness dispelled his own
how are you he said easily
i could not resist the temptation to come out this afternoon it was so pleasant yes said carrie halting before him i was just preparing to go for a walk myself oh were you he said
supposing then you get your hat and we both go they crossed the park and went west along washington boulevard beautiful with its broad macadamised road and large frame houses set back from the sidewalks
it was a street where many of the more prosperous residents of the west side lived and hurstwood could not help feeling nervous over the publicity of it
they had gone but a few blocks when a livery stable sign in one of the side streets solved the difficulty for him
he would take her to drive along the new boulevard
the boulevard at that time was little more than a country road
the part he intended showing her was much farther out on this same west side where there was scarcely a house
it connected douglas park with washington or south park and was nothing more than a neatly made road running due south for some five miles over an open grassy prairie and then due east over the same kind of prairie for the same distance
there was not a house to be encountered anywhere along the larger part of the route and any conversation would be pleasantly free of interruption
at the stable he picked a gentle horse and they were soon out of range of either public observation or hearing
can you drive he said after a time
i never tried said carrie
he put the reins in her hand and folded his arms
you see theres nothing to it much he said smilingly
not when you have a gentle horse said carrie
you can handle a horse as well as any one after a little practice he added encouragingly
he had been looking for some time for a break in the conversation when he could give it a serious turn
once or twice he had held his peace hoping that in silence her thoughts would take the colour of his own but she had lightly continued the subject
presently however his silence controlled the situation
the drift of his thoughts began to tell
he gazed fixedly at nothing in particular as if he were thinking of something which concerned her not at all
his thoughts however spoke for themselves
she was very much aware that a climax was pending
do you know he said i have spent the happiest evenings in years since i have known you have you she said with assumed airiness but still excited by the conviction which the tone of his voice carried
i was going to tell you the other evening he added but somehow the opportunity slipped away carrie was listening without attempting to reply
she could think of nothing worth while to say
despite all the ideas concerning right which had troubled her vaguely since she had last seen him she was now influenced again strongly in his favour
i came out here today he went on solemnly to tell you just how i feelto see if you wouldnt listen to me hurstwood was something of a romanticist after his kind
he was capable of strong feelingsoften poetic onesand under a stress of desire such as the present he waxed eloquent
that is his feelings and his voice were coloured with that seeming repression and pathos which is the essence of eloquence
you know he said putting his hand on her arm and keeping a strange silence while he formulated words that i love you carrie did not stir at the words
she was bound up completely in the mans atmosphere
he would have churchlike silence in order to express his feelings and she kept it
she did not move her eyes from the flat open scene before her
hurstwood waited for a few moments and then repeated the words
you must not say that she said weakly
her words were not convincing at all
they were the result of a feeble thought that something ought to be said
he paid no attention to them whatever
carrie he said using her first name with sympathetic familiarity i want you to love me
you dont know how much i need some one to waste a little affection on me
i am practically alone
there is nothing in my life that is pleasant or delightful
its all work and worry with people who are nothing to me as he said this hurstwood really imagined that his state was pitiful
he had the ability to get off at a distance and view himself objectivelyof seeing what he wanted to see in the things which made up his existence
now as he spoke his voice trembled with that peculiar vibration which is the result of tensity
it went ringing home to his companions heart
why i should think she said turning upon him large eyes which were full of sympathy and feeling that you would be very happy
you know so much of the world that is it he said his voice dropping to a soft minor i know too much of the world it was an important thing to her to hear one so wellpositioned and powerful speaking in this manner
she could not help feeling the strangeness of her situation
how was it that in so little a while the narrow life of the country had fallen from her as a garment and the city with all its mystery taken its place
here was this greatest mystery the man of money and affairs sitting beside her appealing to her
behold he had ease and comfort his strength was great his position high his clothing rich and yet he was appealing to her
she could formulate no thought which would be just and right
she troubled herself no more upon the matter
she only basked in the warmth of his feeling which was as a grateful blaze to one who is cold
hurstwood glowed with his own intensity and the heat of his passion was already melting the wax of his companions scruples
you think he said i am happy that i ought not to complain
if you were to meet all day with people who care absolutely nothing about you if you went day after day to a place where there was nothing but show and indifference if there was not one person in all those you knew to whom you could appeal for sympathy or talk to with pleasure perhaps you would be unhappy too he was striking a chord now which found sympathetic response in her own situation
she knew what it was to meet with people who were indifferent to walk alone amid so many who cared absolutely nothing about you
had not she
was not she at this very moment quite alone
who was there among all whom she knew to whom she could appeal for sympathy
not one
she was left to herself to brood and wonder
i could be content went on hurstwood if i had you to love me
if i had you to go to you for a companion
as it is i simply move about from place to place without any satisfaction
time hangs heavily on my hands
before you came i did nothing but idle and drift into anything that offered itself
since you camewell ive had you to think about the old illusion that here was some one who needed her aid began to grow in carries mind
she truly pitied this sad lonely figure
to think that all his fine state should be so barren for want of her that he needed to make such an appeal when she herself was lonely and without anchor
surely this was too bad
i am not very bad he said apologetically as if he owed it to her to explain on this score
you think probably that i roam around and get into all sorts of evil
i have been rather reckless but i could easily come out of that
i need you to draw me back if my life ever amounts to anything carrie looked at him with the tenderness which virtue ever feels in its hope of reclaiming vice
how could such a man need reclaiming
his errors what were they that she could correct
small they must be where all was so fine
at worst they were gilded affairs and with what leniency are gilded errors viewed
he put himself in such a lonely light that she was deeply moved
is it that way she mused
he slipped his arm about her waist and she could not find the heart to draw away
with his free hand he seized upon her fingers
a breath of soft spring wind went bounding over the road rolling some brown twigs of the previous autumn before it
the horse paced leisurely on unguided
tell me he said softly that you love me her eyes fell consciously
own to it dear he said feelingly you do dont you she made no answer but he felt his victory
tell me he said richly drawing her so close that their lips were near together
he pressed her hand warmly and then released it to touch her cheek
you do he said pressing his lips to her own
for answer her lips replied
now he said joyously his fine eyes ablaze youre my own girl arent you by way of further conclusion her head lay softly upon his shoulder
chapter xiv
with eyes and not seeing one influence wanes carrie in her rooms that evening was in a fine glow physically and mentally
she was deeply rejoicing in her affection for hurstwood and his love and looked forward with fine fancy to their next meeting sunday night
they had agreed without any feeling of enforced secrecy that she should come down town and meet him though after all the need of it was the cause
mrs hale from her upper window saw her come in
um she thought to herself she goes riding with another man when her husband is out of the city
he had better keep an eye on her the truth is that mrs hale was not the only one who had a thought on this score
the housemaid who had welcomed hurstwood had her opinion also
she had no particular regard for carrie whom she took to be cold and disagreeable
at the same time she had a fancy for the merry and easymannered drouet who threw her a pleasant remark now and then and in other ways extended her the evidence of that regard which he had for all members of the sex
hurstwood was more reserved and critical in his manner
he did not appeal to this bodiced functionary in the same pleasant way
she wondered that he came so frequently that mrs drouet should go out with him this afternoon when mr drouet was absent
she gave vent to her opinions in the kitchen where the cook was
as a result a hum of gossip was set going which moved about the house in that secret manner common to gossip
carrie now that she had yielded sufficiently to hurstwood to confess her affection no longer troubled about her attitude towards him
temporarily she gave little thought to drouet thinking only of the dignity and grace of her lover and of his consuming affection for her
on the first evening she did little but go over the details of the afternoon
it was the first time her sympathies had ever been thoroughly aroused and they threw a new light on her character
she had some power of initiative latent before which now began to exert itself
she looked more practically upon her state and began to see glimmerings of a way out
hurstwood seemed a drag in the direction of honour
her feelings were exceedingly creditable in that they constructed out of these recent developments something which conquered freedom from dishonour
she had no idea what hurstwoods next word would be
she only took his affection to be a fine thing and appended better more generous results accordingly
as yet hurstwood had only a thought of pleasure without responsibility
he did not feel that he was doing anything to complicate his life
his position was secure his homelife if not satisfactory was at least undisturbed his personal liberty rather untrammelled
carries love represented only so much added pleasure
he would enjoy this new gift over and above his ordinary allowance of pleasure
he would be happy with her and his own affairs would go on as they had undisturbed
on sunday evening carrie dined with him at a place he had selected in east adams street and thereafter they took a cab to what was then a pleasant evening resort out on cottage grove avenue near th street
in the process of his declaration he soon realised that carrie took his love upon a higher basis than he had anticipated
she kept him at a distance in a rather earnest way and submitted only to those tender tokens of affection which better become the inexperienced lover
hurstwood saw that she was not to be possessed for the asking and deferred pressing his suit too warmly
since he feigned to believe in her married state he found that he had to carry out the part
his triumph he saw was still at a little distance
how far he could not guess
they were returning to ogden place in the cab when he asked when will i see you again i dont know she answered wondering herself
why not come down to the fair he suggested next tuesday she shook her head
not so soon she answered
ill tell you what ill do he added
ill write you care of this west side postoffice
could you call next tuesday carrie assented
the cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call
goodnight he whispered as the cab rolled away
unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair drouet returned
hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw drouet enter
why hello charles he called affably back again yes smiled drouet approaching and looking in at the door
hurstwood arose
well he said looking the drummer over rosy as ever eh they began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened
been home yet finally asked hurstwood
no i am going though said drouet
i remembered the little girl out there said hurstwood and called once
thought you wouldnt want her left quite alone right you are agreed drouet
how is she very well said hurstwood
rather anxious about you though
youd better go out now and cheer her up i will said drouet smilingly
like to have you both come down and go to the show with me wednesday concluded hurstwood at parting
thanks old man said his friend ill see what the girl says and let you know they separated in the most cordial manner
theres a nice fellow drouet thought to himself as he turned the corner towards madison
drouet is a good fellow hurstwood thought to himself as he went back into his office but hes no man for carrie the thought of the latter turned his mind into a most pleasant vein and he wandered how he would get ahead of the drummer
when drouet entered carries presence he caught her in his arms as usual but she responded to his kiss with a tremour of opposition
well he said i had a great trip did you
how did you come out with that la crosse man you were telling me about oh fine sold him a complete line
there was another fellow there representing burnstein a regular hooknosed sheeny but he wasnt in it
i made him look like nothing at all as he undid his collar and unfastened his studs preparatory to washing his face and changing his clothes he dilated upon his trip
carrie could not help listening with amusement to his animated descriptions
i tell you he said i surprised the people at the office
ive sold more goods this last quarter than any other man of our house on the road
i sold three thousand dollars worth in la crosse he plunged his face in a basin of water and puffed and blew as he rubbed his neck and ears with his hands while carrie gazed upon him with mingled thoughts of recollection and present judgment
he was still wiping his face when he continued im going to strike for a raise in june
they can afford to pay it as much business as i turn in
ill get it too dont you forget i hope you do said carrie
and then if that little real estate deal ive got on goes through well get married he said with a great show of earnestness the while he took his place before the mirror and began brushing his hair
i dont believe you ever intend to marry me charlie carrie said ruefully
the recent protestations of hurstwood had given her courage to say this
oh yes i docourse i dowhat put that into your head he had stopped his trifling before the mirror now and crossed over to her
for the first time carrie felt as if she must move away from him
but youve been saying that so long she said looking with her pretty face upturned into his
well and i mean it too but it takes money to live as i want to
now when i get this increase i can come pretty near fixing things all right and ill do it
now dont you worry girlie he patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder but carrie felt how really futile had been her hopes
she could clearly see that this easygoing soul intended no move in her behalf
he was simply letting things drift because he preferred the free round of his present state to any legal trammellings
in contrast hurstwood appeared strong and sincere
he had no easy manner of putting her off
he sympathised with her and showed her what her true value was
he needed her while drouet did not care
oh no she said remorsefully her tone reflecting some of her own success and more of her helplessness you never will well you wait a little while and see he concluded
ill marry you all right carrie looked at him and felt justified
she was looking for something which would calm her conscience and here it was a light airy disregard of her claims upon his justice
he had faithfully promised to marry her and this was the way he fulfilled his promise
say he said after he had as he thought pleasantly disposed of the marriage question i saw hurstwood today and he wants us to go to the theatre with him carrie started at the name but recovered quickly enough to avoid notice
when she asked with assumed indifference
wednesday
well go wont we if you think so she answered her manner being so enforcedly reserved as to almost excite suspicion
drouet noticed something but he thought it was due to her feelings concerning their talk about marriage
he called once he said yes said carrie he was out here sunday evening was he said drouet
i thought from what he said that he had called a week or so ago so he did answered carrie who was wholly unaware of what conversation her lovers might have held
she was all at sea mentally and fearful of some entanglement which might ensue from what she would answer
oh then he called twice said drouet the first shade of misunderstanding showing in his face
yes said carrie innocently feeling now that hurstwood must have mentioned but one call
drouet imagined that he must have misunderstood his friend
he did not attach particular importance to the information after all
what did he have to say he queried with slightly increased curiosity
he said he came because he thought i might be lonely
you hadnt been in there so long he wondered what had become of you george is a fine fellow said drouet rather gratified by his conception of the managers interest
come on and well go out to dinner when hurstwood saw that drouet was back he wrote at once to carrie saying i told him i called on you dearest when he was away
i did not say how often but he probably thought once
let me know of anything you may have said
answer by special messenger when you get this and darling i must see you
let me know if you cant meet me at jackson and throop streets wednesday afternoon at two oclock
i want to speak with you before we meet at the theatre carrie received this tuesday morning when she called at the west side branch of the postoffice and answered at once
i said you called twice she wrote
he didnt seem to mind
i will try and be at throop street if nothing interferes
i seem to be getting very bad
its wrong to act as i do i know hurstwood when he met her as agreed reassured her on this score
you mustnt worry sweetheart he said
just as soon as he goes on the road again we will arrange something
well fix it so that you wont have to deceive any one carrie imagined that he would marry her at once though he had not directly said so and her spirits rose
she proposed to make the best of the situation until drouet left again
dont show any more interest in me than you ever have hurstwood counselled concerning the evening at the theatre
you mustnt look at me steadily then she answered mindful of the power of his eyes
i wont he said squeezing her hand at parting and giving the glance she had just cautioned against
there she said playfully pointing a finger at him
the show hasnt begun yet he returned
he watched her walk from him with tender solicitation
such youth and prettiness reacted upon him more subtly than wine
at the theatre things passed as they had in hurstwoods favour
if he had been pleasing to carrie before how much more so was he now
his grace was more permeating because it found a readier medium
carrie watched his every movement with pleasure
she almost forgot poor drouet who babbled on as if he were the host
hurstwood was too clever to give the slightest indication of a change
he paid if anything more attention to his old friend than usual and yet in no way held him up to that subtle ridicule which a lover in favour may so secretly practise before the mistress of his heart
if anything he felt the injustice of the game as it stood and was not cheap enough to add to it the slightest mental taunt
only the play produced an ironical situation and this was due to drouet alone
the scene was one in the covenant in which the wife listened to the seductive voice of a lover in the absence of her husband
served him right said drouet afterward even in view of her keen expiation of her error
i havent any pity for a man who would be such a chump as that well you never can tell returned hurstwood gently
he probably thought he was right well a man ought to be more attentive than that to his wife if he wants to keep her they had come out of the lobby and made their way through the showy crush about the entrance way
say mister said a voice at hurstwoods side would you mind giving me the price of a bed hurstwood was interestedly remarking to carrie
honest to god mister im without a place to sleep the plea was that of a gauntfaced man of about thirty who looked the picture of privation and wretchedness
drouet was the first to see
he handed over a dime with an upwelling feeling of pity in his heart
hurstwood scarcely noticed the incident
carrie quickly forgot
chapter xv
the irk of the old ties the magic of youth the complete ignoring by hurstwood of his own home came with the growth of his affection for carrie
his actions in all that related to his family were of the most perfunctory kind
he sat at breakfast with his wife and children absorbed in his own fancies which reached far without the realm of their interests
he read his paper which was heightened in interest by the shallowness of the themes discussed by his son and daughter
between himself and his wife ran a river of indifference
now that carrie had come he was in a fair way to be blissful again
there was delight in going down town evenings
when he walked forth in the short days the street lamps had a merry twinkle
he began to experience the almost forgotten feeling which hastens the lovers feet
when he looked at his fine clothes he saw them with her eyesand her eyes were young
when in the flush of such feelings he heard his wifes voice when the insistent demands of matrimony recalled him from dreams to a stale practice how it grated
he then knew that this was a chain which bound his feet
george said mrs hurstwood in that tone of voice which had long since come to be associated in his mind with demands we want you to get us a season ticket to the races do you want to go to all of them he said with a rising inflection
yes she answered
the races in question were soon to open at washington park on the south side and were considered quite society affairs among those who did not affect religious rectitude and conservatism
mrs hurstwood had never asked for a whole season ticket before but this year certain considerations decided her to get a box
for one thing one of her neighbours a certain mr and mrs ramsey who were possessors of money made out of the coal business had done so
in the next place her favourite physician dr beale a gentleman inclined to horses and betting had talked with her concerning his intention to enter a twoyearold in the derby
in the third place she wished to exhibit jessica who was gaining in maturity and beauty and whom she hoped to marry to a man of means
her own desire to be about in such things and parade among her acquaintances and common throng was as much an incentive as anything
hurstwood thought over the proposition a few moments without answering
they were in the sitting room on the second floor waiting for supper
it was the evening of his engagement with carrie and drouet to see the covenant which had brought him home to make some alterations in his dress
youre sure separate tickets wouldnt do as well he asked hesitating to say anything more rugged
no she replied impatiently
well he said taking offence at her manner you neednt get mad about it
im just asking you im not mad she snapped
im merely asking you for a season ticket and im telling you he returned fixing a clear steady eye on her that its no easy thing to get
im not sure whether the manager will give it to me he had been thinking all the time of his pull with the racetrack magnates
we can buy it then she exclaimed sharply
you talk easy he said
a season family ticket costs one hundred and fifty dollars ill not argue with you she replied with determination
i want the ticket and thats all there is to it she had risen and now walked angrily out of the room
well you get it then he said grimly though in a modified tone of voice
as usual the table was one short that evening
the next morning he had cooled down considerably and later the ticket was duly secured though it did not heal matters
he did not mind giving his family a fair share of all that he earned but he did not like to be forced to provide against his will
did you know mother said jessica another day the spencers are getting ready to go away no
where i wonder europe said jessica
i met georgine yesterday and she told me
she just put on more airs about it did she say when monday i think
theyll get a notice in the papers againthey always do never mind said mrs hurstwood consolingly well go one of these days hurstwood moved his eyes over the paper slowly but said nothing
we sail for liverpool from new york jessica exclaimed mocking her acquaintance
expect to spend most of the summah in francevain thing
as if it was anything to go to europe it must be if you envy her so much put in hurstwood
it grated upon him to see the feeling his daughter displayed
dont worry over them my dear said mrs hurstwood
did george get off asked jessica of her mother another day thus revealing something that hurstwood had heard nothing about
where has he gone he asked looking up
he had never before been kept in ignorance concerning departures
he was going to wheaton said jessica not noticing the slight put upon her father
whats out there he asked secretly irritated and chagrined to think that he should be made to pump for information in this manner
a tennis match said jessica
he didnt say anything to me hurstwood concluded finding it difficult to refrain from a bitter tone
i guess he must have forgotten exclaimed his wife blandly
in the past he had always commanded a certain amount of respect which was a compound of appreciation and awe
the familiarity which in part still existed between himself and his daughter he had courted
as it was it did not go beyond the light assumption of words
the tone was always modest
whatever had been however had lacked affection and now he saw that he was losing track of their doings
his knowledge was no longer intimate
he sometimes saw them at table and sometimes did not
he heard of their doings occasionally more often not
some days he found that he was all at sea as to what they were talking aboutthings they had arranged to do or that they had done in his absence
more affecting was the feeling that there were little things going on of which he no longer heard
jessica was beginning to feel that her affairs were her own
george jr flourished about as if he were a man entirely and must needs have private matters
all this hurstwood could see and it left a trace of feeling for he was used to being consideredin his official position at leastand felt that his importance should not begin to wane here
to darken it all he saw the same indifference and independence growing in his wife while he looked on and paid the bills
he consoled himself with the thought however that after all he was not without affection
things might go as they would at his house but he had carrie outside of it
with his minds eye he looked into her comfortable room in ogden place where he had spent several such delightful evenings and thought how charming it would be when drouet was disposed of entirely and she was waiting evenings in cosey little quarters for him
that no cause would come up whereby drouet would be led to inform carrie concerning his married state he felt hopeful
things were going so smoothly that he believed they would not change
shortly now he would persuade carrie and all would be satisfactory
the day after their theatre visit he began writing her regularlya letter every morning and begging her to do as much for him
he was not literary by any means but experience of the world and his growing affection gave him somewhat of a style
this he exercised at his office desk with perfect deliberation
he purchased a box of delicately coloured and scented writing paper in monogram which he kept locked in one of the drawers
his friends now wondered at the cleric and very officiallooking nature of his position
the five bartenders viewed with respect the duties which could call a man to do so much deskwork and penmanship
hurstwood surprised himself with his fluency
by the natural law which governs all effort what he wrote reacted upon him
he began to feel those subtleties which he could find words to express
with every expression came increased conception
those inmost breathings which there found words took hold upon him
he thought carrie worthy of all the affection he could there express
carrie was indeed worth loving if ever youth and grace are to command that token of acknowledgment from life in their bloom
experience had not yet taken away that freshness of the spirit which is the charm of the body
her soft eyes contained in their liquid lustre no suggestion of the knowledge of disappointment
she had been troubled in a way by doubt and longing but these had made no deeper impression than could be traced in a certain open wistfulness of glance and speech
the mouth had the expression at times in talking and in repose of one who might be upon the verge of tears
it was not that grief was thus ever present
the pronunciation of certain syllables gave to her lips this peculiarity of formationa formation as suggestive and moving as pathos itself
there was nothing bold in her manner
life had not taught her dominationsuperciliousness of grace which is the lordly power of some women
her longing for consideration was not sufficiently powerful to move her to demand it
even now she lacked selfassurance but there was that in what she had already experienced which left her a little less than timid
she wanted pleasure she wanted position and yet she was confused as to what these things might be
every hour the kaleidoscope of human affairs threw a new lustre upon something and therewith it became for her the desiredthe all
another shift of the box and some other had become the beautiful the perfect
on her spiritual side also she was rich in feeling as such a nature well might be
sorrow in her was aroused by many a spectaclean uncritical upwelling of grief for the weak and the helpless
she was constantly pained by the sight of the whitefaced ragged men who slopped desperately by her in a sort of wretched mental stupor
the poorly clad girls who went blowing by her window evenings hurrying home from some of the shops of the west side she pitied from the depths of her heart
she would stand and bite her lips as they passed shaking her little head and wondering
they had so little she thought
it was so sad to be ragged and poor
the hang of faded clothes pained her eyes
and they have to work so hard was her only comment
on the street sometimes she would see men workingirishmen with picks coalheavers with great loads to shovel americans busy about some work which was a mere matter of strengthand they touched her fancy
toil now that she was free of it seemed even a more desolate thing than when she was part of it
she saw it through a mist of fancya pale sombre halflight which was the essence of poetic feeling
her old father in his flourdusted millers suit sometimes returned to her in memory revived by a face in a window
a shoemaker pegging at his last a blastman seen through a narrow window in some basement where iron was being melted a benchworker seen high aloft in some window his coat off his sleeves rolled up these took her back in fancy to the details of the mill
she felt though she seldom expressed them sad thoughts upon this score
her sympathies were ever with that underworld of toil from which she had so recently sprung and which she best understood
though hurstwood did not know it he was dealing with one whose feelings were as tender and as delicate as this
he did not know but it was this in her after all which attracted him
he never attempted to analyse the nature of his affection
it was sufficient that there was tenderness in her eye weakness in her manner good nature and hope in her thoughts
he drew near this lily which had sucked its waxen beauty and perfume from below a depth of waters which he had never penetrated and out of ooze and mould which he could not understand
he drew near because it was waxen and fresh
it lightened his feelings for him
it made the morning worth while
in a material way she was considerably improved
her awkwardness had all but passed leaving if anything a quaint residue which was as pleasing as perfect grace
her little shoes now fitted her smartly and had high heels
she had learned much about laces and those little neckpieces which add so much to a womans appearance
her form had filled out until it was admirably plump and wellrounded
hurstwood wrote her one morning asking her to meet him in jefferson park monroe street
he did not consider it policy to call any more even when drouet was at home
the next afternoon he was in the pretty little park by one and had found a rustic bench beneath the green leaves of a lilac bush which bordered one of the paths
it was at that season of the year when the fulness of spring had not yet worn quite away
at a little pond near by some cleanly dressed children were sailing white canvas boats
in the shade of a green pagoda a bebuttoned officer of the law was resting his arms folded his club at rest in his belt
an old gardener was upon the lawn with a pair of pruning shears looking after some bushes
high overhead was the clean blue sky of the new summer and in the thickness of the shiny green leaves of the trees hopped and twittered the busy sparrows
hurstwood had come out of his own home that morning feeling much of the same old annoyance
at his store he had idled there being no need to write
he had come away to this place with the lightness of heart which characterises those who put weariness behind
now in the shade of this cool green bush he looked about him with the fancy of the lover
he heard the carts go lumbering by upon the neighbouring streets but they were far off and only buzzed upon his ear
the hum of the surrounding city was faint the clang of an occasional bell was as music
he looked and dreamed a new dream of pleasure which concerned his present fixed condition not at all
he got back in fancy to the old hurstwood who was neither married nor fixed in a solid position for life
he remembered the light spirit in which he once looked after the girlshow he had danced escorted them home hung over their gates
he almost wished he was back there againhere in this pleasant scene he felt as if he were wholly free
at two carrie came tripping along the walk toward him rosy and clean
she had just recently donned a sailor hat for the season with a band of pretty whitedotted blue silk
her skirt was of a rich blue material and her shirt waist matched it with a thinstripe of blue upon a snowwhite groundstripes that were as fine as hairs
her brown shoes peeped occasionally from beneath her skirt
she carried her gloves in her hand
hurstwood looked up at her with delight
you came dearest he said eagerly standing to meet her and taking her hand
of course she said smiling did you think i wouldnt i didnt know he replied
he looked at her forehead which was moist from her brisk walk
then he took out one of his own soft scented silk handkerchiefs and touched her face here and there
now he said affectionately youre all right they were happy in being near one anotherin looking into each others eyes
finally when the long flush of delight had subsided he said when is charlie going away again i dont know she answered
he says he has some things to do for the house here now hurstwood grew serious and he lapsed into quiet thought
he looked up after a time to say come away and leave him he turned his eyes to the boys with the boats as if the request were of little importance
where would we go she asked in much the same manner rolling her gloves and looking into a neighbouring tree
where do you want to go he enquired
there was something in the tone in which he said this which made her feel as if she must record her feelings against any local habitation
we cant stay in chicago she replied
he had no thought that this was in her mindthat any removal would be suggested
why not he asked softly
oh because she said i wouldnt want to he listened to this with but dull perception of what it meant
it had no serious ring to it
the question was not up for immediate decision
i would have to give up my position he said
the tone he used made it seem as if the matter deserved only slight consideration
carrie thought a little the while enjoying the pretty scene
i wouldnt like to live in chicago and him here she said thinking of drouet
its a big town dearest hurstwood answered
it would be as good as moving to another part of the country to move to the south side he had fixed upon that region as an objective point
anyhow said carrie i shouldnt want to get married as long as he is here
i wouldnt want to run away the suggestion of marriage struck hurstwood forcibly
he saw clearly that this was her ideahe felt that it was not to be gotten over easily
bigamy lightened the horizon of his shadowy thoughts for a moment
he wondered for the life of him how it would all come out
he could not see that he was making any progress save in her regard
when he looked at her now he thought her beautiful
what a thing it was to have her love him even if it be entangling
she increased in value in his eyes because of her objection
she was something to struggle for and that was everything
how different from the women who yielded willingly
he swept the thought of them from his mind
and you dont know when hell go away asked hurstwood quietly
she shook her head
he sighed
youre a determined little miss arent you he said after a few moments looking up into her eyes
she felt a wave of feeling sweep over her at this
it was pride at what seemed his admirationaffection for the man who could feel this concerning her
no she said coyly but what can i do again he folded his hands and looked away over the lawn into the street
i wish he said pathetically you would come to me
i dont like to be away from you this way
what good is there in waiting
youre not any happier are you happier she exclaimed softly you know better than that here we are then he went on in the same tone wasting our days
if you are not happy do you think i am
i sit and write to you the biggest part of the time
ill tell you what carrie he exclaimed throwing sudden force of expression into his voice and fixing her with his eyes i cant live without you and thats all there is to it
now he concluded showing the palm of one of his white hands in a sort of atanend helpless expression what shall i do this shifting of the burden to her appealed to carrie
the semblance of the load without the weight touched the womans heart
cant you wait a little while yet she said tenderly
ill try and find out when hes going what good will it do he asked holding the same strain of feeling
well perhaps we can arrange to go somewhere she really did not see anything clearer than before but she was getting into that frame of mind where out of sympathy a woman yields
hurstwood did not understand
he was wondering how she was to be persuadedwhat appeal would move her to forsake drouet
he began to wonder how far her affection for him would carry her
he was thinking of some question which would make her tell
finally he hit upon one of those problematical propositions which often disguise our own desires while leading us to an understanding of the difficulties which others make for us and so discover for us a way
it had not the slightest connection with anything intended on his part and was spoken at random before he had given it a moments serious thought
carrie he said looking into her face and assuming a serious look which he did not feel suppose i were to come to you next week or this week for that mattertonight sayand tell you i had to go awaythat i couldnt stay another minute and wasnt coming back any morewould you come with me his sweetheart viewed him with the most affectionate glance her answer ready before the words were out of his mouth
yes she said
you wouldnt stop to argue or arrange not if you couldnt wait he smiled when he saw that she took him seriously and he thought what a chance it would afford for a possible junket of a week or two
he had a notion to tell her that he was joking and so brush away her sweet seriousness but the effect of it was too delightful
he let it stand
suppose we didnt have time to get married here he added an afterthought striking him
if we got married as soon as we got to the other end of the journey it would be all right i meant that he said
yes the morning seemed peculiarly bright to him now
he wondered whatever could have put such a thought into his head
impossible as it was he could not help smiling at its cleverness
it showed how she loved him
there was no doubt in his mind now and he would find a way to win her
well he said jokingly ill come and get you one of these evenings and then he laughed
i wouldnt stay with you though if you didnt marry me carrie added reflectively
i dont want you to he said tenderly taking her hand
she was extremely happy now that she understood
she loved him the more for thinking that he would rescue her so
as for him the marriage clause did not dwell in his mind
he was thinking that with such affection there could be no bar to his eventual happiness
lets stroll about he said gayly rising and surveying all the lovely park
all right said carrie
they passed the young irishman who looked after them with envious eyes
tis a foine couple he observed to himself
they must be rich chapter xvi
a witless aladdin the gate to the world in the course of his present stay in chicago drouet paid some slight attention to the secret order to which he belonged
during his last trip he had received a new light on its importance
i tell you said another drummer to him its a great thing
look at hazenstab
he isnt so deuced clever
of course hes got a good house behind him but that wont do alone
i tell you its his degree
hes a wayup mason and that goes a long way
hes got a secret sign that stands for something drouet resolved then and there that he would take more interest in such matters
so when he got back to chicago he repaired to his local lodge headquarters
i say drouet said mr harry quincel an individual who was very prominent in this local branch of the elks youre the man that can help us out it was after the business meeting and things were going socially with a hum
drouet was bobbing around chatting and joking with a score of individuals whom he knew
what are you up to he inquired genially turning a smiling face upon his secret brother
were trying to get up some theatricals for two weeks from today and we want to know if you dont know some young lady who could take a partits an easy part sure said drouet what is it he did not trouble to remember that he knew no one to whom he could appeal on this score
his innate goodnature however dictated a favourable reply
well now ill tell you what we are trying to do went on mr quincel
we are trying to get a new set of furniture for the lodge
there isnt enough money in the treasury at the present time and we thought we would raise it by a little entertainment sure interrupted drouet thats a good idea several of the boys around here have got talent
theres harry burbeck he does a fine blackface turn
mac lewis is all right at heavy dramatics
did you ever hear him recite over the hills never did well i tell you he does it fine and you want me to get some woman to take a part questioned drouet anxious to terminate the subject and get on to something else
what are you going to play under the gaslight said mr quincel mentioning augustin dalys famous production which had worn from a great public success down to an amateur theatrical favourite with many of the troublesome accessories cut out and the dramatis person reduced to the smallest possible number
drouet had seen this play some time in the past
thats it he said thats a fine play
it will go all right
you ought to make a lot of money out of that we think well do very well mr quincel replied
dont you forget now he concluded drouet showing signs of restlessness some young woman to take the part of laura sure ill attend to it he moved away forgetting almost all about it the moment mr quincel had ceased talking
he had not even thought to ask the time or place
drouet was reminded of his promise a day or two later by the receipt of a letter announcing that the first rehearsal was set for the following friday evening and urging him to kindly forward the young ladys address at once in order that the part might be delivered to her
now who the deuce do i know asked the drummer reflectively scratching his rosy ear
i dont know any one that knows anything about amateur theatricals he went over in memory the names of a number of women he knew and finally fixed on one largely because of the convenient location of her home on the west side and promised himself that as he came out that evening he would see her
when however he started west on the car he forgot and was only reminded of his delinquency by an item in the evening newsa small threeline affair under the head of secret society noteswhich stated the custer lodge of the order of elks would give a theatrical performance in avery hall on the th when under the gaslight would be produced
george exclaimed drouet i forgot that what inquired carrie
they were at their little table in the room which might have been used for a kitchen where carrie occasionally served a meal
tonight the fancy had caught her and the little table was spread with a pleasing repast
why my lodge entertainment
theyre going to give a play and they wanted me to get them some young lady to take a part what is it theyre going to play under the gaslight when on the th well why dont you asked carrie
i dont know any one he replied
suddenly he looked up
say he said how would you like to take the part me said carrie
i cant act how do you know questioned drouet reflectively
because answered carrie i never did nevertheless she was pleased to think he would ask
her eyes brightened for if there was anything that enlisted her sympathies it was the art of the stage
true to his nature drouet clung to this idea as an easy way out
thats nothing
you can act all you have to down there no i cant said carrie weakly very much drawn toward the proposition and yet fearful
yes you can
now why dont you do it
they need some one and it will be lots of fun for you oh no it wont said carrie seriously
youd like that
i know you would
ive seen you dancing around here and giving imitations and thats why i asked you
youre clever enough all right no im not said carrie shyly
now ill tell you what you do
you go down and see about it
itll be fun for you
the rest of the company isnt going to be any good
they havent any experience
what do they know about theatricals he frowned as he thought of their ignorance
hand me the coffee he added
i dont believe i could act charlie carrie went on pettishly
you dont think i could do you sure
out o sight
i bet you make a hit
now you want to go i know you do
i knew it when i came home
thats why i asked you what is the play did you say under the gaslight what part would they want me to take oh one of the heroinesi dont know what sort of a play is it well said drouet whose memory for such things was not the best its about a girl who gets kidnapped by a couple of crooksa man and a woman that live in the slums
she had some money or something and they wanted to get it
i dont know now how it did go exactly dont you know what part i would have to take no i dont to tell the truth he thought a moment
yes i do too
laura thats the thingyoure to be laura and you cant remember what the part is like to save me cad i cant he answered
i ought to too ive seen the play enough
theres a girl in it that was stolen when she was an infantwas picked off the street or somethingand shes the one thats hounded by the two old criminals i was telling you about he stopped with a mouthful of pie poised on a fork before his face
she comes very near getting drownedno thats not it
ill tell you what ill do he concluded hopelessly ill get you the book
i cant remember now for the life of me well i dont know said carrie when he had concluded her interest and desire to shine dramatically struggling with her timidity for the mastery
i might go if you thought id do all right of course youll do said drouet who in his efforts to enthuse carrie had interested himself
do you think id come home here and urge you to do something that i didnt think you would make a success of
you can act all right
itll be good for you when must i go said carrie reflectively
the first rehearsal is friday night
ill get the part for you tonight all right said carrie resignedly ill do it but if i make a failure now its your fault you wont fail assured drouet
just act as you do around here
be natural
youre all right
ive often thought youd make a corking good actress did you really asked carrie
thats right said the drummer
he little knew as he went out of the door that night what a secret flame he had kindled in the bosom of the girl he left behind
carrie was possessed of that sympathetic impressionable nature which ever in the most developed form has been the glory of the drama
she was created with that passivity of soul which is always the mirror of the active world
she possessed an innate taste for imitation and no small ability
even without practice she could sometimes restore dramatic situations she had witnessed by recreating before her mirror the expressions of the various faces taking part in the scene
she loved to modulate her voice after the conventional manner of the distressed heroine and repeat such pathetic fragments as appealed most to her sympathies
of late seeing the airy grace of the ingenue in several wellconstructed plays she had been moved to secretly imitate it and many were the little movements and expressions of the body in which she indulged from time to time in the privacy of her chamber
on several occasions when drouet had caught her admiring herself as he imagined in the mirror she was doing nothing more than recalling some little grace of the mouth or the eyes which she had witnessed in another
under his airy accusation she mistook this for vanity and accepted the blame with a faint sense of error though as a matter of fact it was nothing more than the first subtle outcroppings of an artistic nature endeavouring to recreate the perfect likeness of some phase of beauty which appealed to her
in such feeble tendencies be it known such outworking of desire to reproduce life lies the basis of all dramatic art
now when carrie heard drouets laudatory opinion of her dramatic ability her body tingled with satisfaction
like the flame which welds the loosened particles into a solid mass his words united those floating wisps of feeling which she had felt but never believed concerning her possible ability and made them into a gaudy shred of hope
like all human beings she had a touch of vanity
she felt that she could do things if she only had a chance
how often had she looked at the welldressed actresses on the stage and wondered how she would look how delightful she would feel if only she were in their place
the glamour the tense situation the fine clothes the applause these had lured her until she felt that she too could actthat she too could compel acknowledgment of power
now she was told that she really couldthat little things she had done about the house had made even him feel her power
it was a delightful sensation while it lasted
when drouet was gone she sat down in her rockingchair by the window to think about it
as usual imagination exaggerated the possibilities for her
it was as if he had put fifty cents in her hand and she had exercised the thoughts of a thousand dollars
she saw herself in a score of pathetic situations in which she assumed a tremulous voice and suffering manner
her mind delighted itself with scenes of luxury and refinement situations in which she was the cynosure of all eyes the arbiter of all fates
as she rocked to and fro she felt the tensity of woe in abandonment the magnificence of wrath after deception the languour of sorrow after defeat
thoughts of all the charming women she had seen in playsevery fancy every illusion which she had concerning the stagenow came back as a returning tide after the ebb
she built up feelings and a determination which the occasion did not warrant
drouet dropped in at the lodge when he went down town and swashed around with a great air as quincel met him
where is that young lady you were going to get for us asked the latter
ive got her said drouet
have you said quincel rather surprised by his promptness thats good
whats her address and he pulled out his notebook in order to be able to send her part to her
you want to send her her part asked the drummer
yes well ill take it
im going right by her house in the morning
what did you say her address was
we only want it in case we have any information to send her twentynine ogden place and her name carrie madenda said the drummer firing at random
the lodge members knew him to be single
that sounds like somebody that can act doesnt it said quincel
yes it does he took the part home to carrie and handed it to her with the manner of one who does a favour
he says thats the best part
do you think you can do it i dont know until i look it over
you know im afraid now that ive said i would oh go on
what have you got to be afraid of
its a cheap company
the rest of them arent as good as you are well ill see said carrie pleased to have the part for all her misgivings
he sidled around dressing and fidgeting before he arranged to make his next remark
they were getting ready to print the programmes he said and i gave them the name of carrie madenda
was that all right yes i guess so said his companion looking up at him
she was thinking it was slightly strange
if you didnt make a hit you know he went on
oh yes she answered rather pleased now with his caution
it was clever for drouet
i didnt want to introduce you as my wife because youd feel worse then if you didnt go
they all know me so well
but youll go all right
anyhow youll probably never meet any of them again oh i dont care said carrie desperately
she was determined now to have a try at the fascinating game
drouet breathed a sigh of relief
he had been afraid that he was about to precipitate another conversation upon the marriage question
the part of laura as carrie found out when she began to examine it was one of suffering and tears
as delineated by mr daly it was true to the most sacred traditions of melodrama as he found it when he began his career
the sorrowful demeanour the tremolo music the long explanatory cumulative addresses all were there
poor fellow read carrie consulting the text and drawing her voice out pathetically
martin be sure and give him a glass of wine before he goes she was surprised at the briefness of the entire part not knowing that she must be on the stage while others were talking and not only be there but also keep herself in harmony with the dramatic movement of the scenes
i think i can do that though she concluded
when drouet came the next night she was very much satisfied with her days study
well how goes it caddie he said
all right she laughed
i think i have it memorised nearly thats good he said
lets hear some of it oh i dont know whether i can get up and say it off here she said bashfully
well i dont know why you shouldnt
itll be easier here than it will there i dont know about that she answered
eventually she took off the ballroom episode with considerable feeling forgetting as she got deeper in the scene all about drouet and letting herself rise to a fine state of feeling
good said drouet fine out o sight
youre all right caddie i tell you he was really moved by her excellent representation and the general appearance of the pathetic little figure as it swayed and finally fainted to the floor
he had bounded up to catch her and now held her laughing in his arms
aint you afraid youll hurt yourself he asked
not a bit well youre a wonder
say i never knew you could do anything like that i never did either said carrie merrily her face flushed with delight
well you can bet that youre all right said drouet
you can take my word for that
you wont fail chapter xvii
a glimpse through the gateway hope lightens the eye the to carrie very important theatrical performance was to take place at the avery on conditions which were to make it more noteworthy than was at first anticipated
the little dramatic student had written to hurstwood the very morning her part was brought her that she was going to take part in a play
i really am she wrote feeling that he might take it as a jest i have my part now honest truly hurstwood smiled in an indulgent way as he read this
i wonder what it is going to be
i must see that he answered at once making a pleasant reference to her ability
i havent the slightest doubt you will make a success
you must come to the park tomorrow morning and tell me all about it carrie gladly complied and revealed all the details of the undertaking as she understood it
well he said thats fine
im glad to hear it
of course you will do well youre so clever he had truly never seen so much spirit in the girl before
her tendency to discover a touch of sadness had for the nonce disappeared
as she spoke her eyes were bright her cheeks red
she radiated much of the pleasure which her undertakings gave her
for all her misgivingsand they were as plentiful as the moments of the dayshe was still happy
she could not repress her delight in doing this little thing which to an ordinary observer had no importance at all
hurstwood was charmed by the development of the fact that the girl had capabilities
there is nothing so inspiring in life as the sight of a legitimate ambition no matter how incipient
it gives colour force and beauty to the possessor
carrie was now lightened by a touch of this divine afflatus
she drew to herself commendation from her two admirers which she had not earned
their affection for her naturally heightened their perception of what she was trying to do and their approval of what she did
her inexperience conserved her own exuberant fancy which ran riot with every straw of opportunity making of it a golden divining rod whereby the treasure of life was to be discovered
lets see said hurstwood i ought to know some of the boys in the lodge
im an elk myself oh you mustnt let him know i told you thats so said the manager
id like for you to be there if you want to come but i dont see how you can unless he asks you ill be there said hurstwood affectionately
i can fix it so he wont know you told me
you leave it to me this interest of the manager was a large thing in itself for the performance for his standing among the elks was something worth talking about
already he was thinking of a box with some friends and flowers for carrie
he would make it a dresssuit affair and give the little girl a chance
within a day or two drouet dropped into the adams street resort and he was at once spied by hurstwood
it was at five in the afternoon and the place was crowded with merchants actors managers politicians a goodly company of rotund rosy figures silkhatted starchybosomed beringed and bescarfpinned to the queens taste
john l sullivan the pugilist was at one end of the glittering bar surrounded by a company of loudly dressed sports who were holding a most animated conversation
drouet came across the floor with a festive stride a new pair of tan shoes squeaking audibly at his progress
well sir said hurstwood i was wondering what had become of you
i thought you had gone out of town again drouet laughed
if you dont report more regularly well have to cut you off the list couldnt help it said the drummer ive been busy they strolled over toward the bar amid the noisy shifting company of notables
the dressy manager was shaken by the hand three times in as many minutes
i hear your lodge is going to give a performance observed hurstwood in the most offhand manner
yes who told you no one said hurstwood
they just sent me a couple of tickets which i can have for two dollars
is it going to be any good i dont know replied the drummer
theyve been trying to get me to get some woman to take a part i wasnt intending to go said the manager easily
ill subscribe of course
how are things over there all right
theyre going to fit things up out of the proceeds well said the manager i hope they make a success of it
have another he did not intend to say any more
now if he should appear on the scene with a few friends he could say that he had been urged to come along
drouet had a desire to wipe out the possibility of confusion
i think the girl is going to take a part in it he said abruptly after thinking it over
you dont say so
how did that happen well they were short and wanted me to find them some one
i told carrie and she seems to want to try good for her said the manager
itll be a real nice affair
do her good too
has she ever had any experience not a bit oh well it isnt anything very serious shes clever though said drouet casting off any imputation against carries ability
she picks up her part quick enough you dont say so said the manager
yes sir she surprised me the other night
by george if she didnt we must give her a nice little sendoff said the manager
ill look after the flowers drouet smiled at his goodnature
after the show you must come with me and well have a little supper i think shell do all right said drouet
i want to see her
shes got to do all right
well make her and the manager gave one of his quick steely halfsmiles which was a compound of goodnature and shrewdness
carrie meanwhile attended the first rehearsal
at this performance mr quincel presided aided by mr millice a young man who had some qualifications of past experience which were not exactly understood by any one
he was so experienced and so businesslike however that he came very near being rudefailing to remember as he did that the individuals he was trying to instruct were volunteer players and not salaried underlings
now miss madenda he said addressing carrie who stood in one part uncertain as to what move to make you dont want to stand like that
put expression in your face
remember you are troubled over the intrusion of the stranger
walk so and he struck out across the avery stage in almost drooping manner
carrie did not exactly fancy the suggestion but the novelty of the situation the presence of strangers all more or less nervous and the desire to do anything rather than make a failure made her timid
she walked in imitation of her mentor as requested inwardly feeling that there was something strangely lacking
now mrs morgan said the director to one young married woman who was to take the part of pearl you sit here
now mr bamberger you stand here so
now what is it you say explain said mr bamberger feebly
he had the part of ray lauras lover the society individual who was to waver in his thoughts of marrying her upon finding that she was a waif and a nobody by birth
how is thatwhat does your text say explain repeated mr bamberger looking intently at his part
yes but it also says the director remarked that you are to look shocked
now say it again and see if you cant look shocked explain demanded mr bamberger vigorously
no no that wont do
say it this wayexplain explain said mr bamberger giving a modified imitation
thats better
now go on one night resumed mrs morgan whose lines came next father and mother were going to the opera
when they were crossing broadway the usual crowd of children accosted them for alms hold on said the director rushing forward his arm extended
put more feeling into what you are saying mrs morgan looked at him as if she feared a personal assault
her eye lightened with resentment
remember mrs morgan he added ignoring the gleam but modifying his manner that youre detailing a pathetic story
you are now supposed to be telling something that is a grief to you
it requires feeling repression thus the usual crowd of children accosted them for alms all right said mrs morgan
now go on as mother felt in her pocket for some change her fingers touched a cold and trembling hand which had clutched her purse very good interrupted the director nodding his head significantly
a pickpocket
well exclaimed mr bamberger speaking the lines that here fell to him
no no mr bamberger said the director approaching not that way
a pickpocketwell so
thats the idea dont you think said carrie weakly noticing that it had not been proved yet whether the members of the company knew their lines let alone the details of expression that it would be better if we just went through our lines once to see if we know them
we might pick up some points a very good idea miss madenda said mr quincel who sat at the side of the stage looking serenely on and volunteering opinions which the director did not heed
all right said the latter somewhat abashed it might be well to do it then brightening with a show of authority suppose we run right through putting in as much expression as we can good said mr quincel
this hand resumed mrs morgan glancing up at mr bamberger and down at her book as the lines proceeded my mother grasped in her own and so tight that a small feeble voice uttered an exclamation of pain
mother looked down and there beside her was a little ragged girl very good observed the director now hopelessly idle
the thief exclaimed mr bamberger
louder put in the director finding it almost impossible to keep his hands off
the thief roared poor bamberger
yes but a thief hardly six years old with a face like an angels
stop said my mother
what are you doing trying to steal said the child
dont you know that it is wicked to do so asked my father
no said the girl but it is dreadful to be hungry who told you to steal asked my mother
shethere said the child pointing to a squalid woman in a doorway opposite who fled suddenly down the street
that is old judas said the girl mrs morgan read this rather flatly and the director was in despair
he fidgeted around and then went over to mr quincel
what do you think of them he asked
oh i guess well be able to whip them into shape said the latter with an air of strength under difficulties
i dont know said the director
that fellow bamberger strikes me as being a pretty poor shift for a lover hes all weve got said quincel rolling up his eyes
harrison went back on me at the last minute
who else can we get i dont know said the director
im afraid hell never pick up at this moment bamberger was exclaiming pearl you are joking with me look at that now said the director whispering behind his hand
my lord
what can you do with a man who drawls out a sentence like that do the best you can said quincel consolingly
the rendition ran on in this wise until it came to where carrie as laura comes into the room to explain to ray who after hearing pearls statement about her birth had written the letter repudiating her which however he did not deliver
bamberger was just concluding the words of ray i must go before she returns
her step
too late and was cramming the letter in his pocket when she began sweetly with ray missmiss courtland bamberger faltered weakly
carrie looked at him a moment and forgot all about the company present
she began to feel the part and summoned an indifferent smile to her lips turning as the lines directed and going to a window as if he were not present
she did it with a grace which was fascinating to look upon
who is that woman asked the director watching carrie in her little scene with bamberger
miss madenda said quincel
i know her name said the director but what does she do i dont know said quincel
shes a friend of one of our members well shes got more gumption than any one ive seen here so farseems to take an interest in what shes doing pretty too isnt she said quincel
the director strolled away without answering
in the second scene where she was supposed to face the company in the ballroom she did even better winning the smile of the director who volunteered because of her fascination for him to come over and speak with her
were you ever on the stage he asked insinuatingly
no said carrie
you do so well i thought you might have had some experience carrie only smiled consciously
he walked away to listen to bamberger who was feebly spouting some ardent line
mrs morgan saw the drift of things and gleamed at carrie with envious and snapping black eyes
shes some cheap professional she gave herself the satisfaction of thinking and scorned and hated her accordingly
the rehearsal ended for one day and carrie went home feeling that she had acquitted herself satisfactorily
the words of the director were ringing in her ears and she longed for an opportunity to tell hurstwood
she wanted him to know just how well she was doing
drouet too was an object for her confidences
she could hardly wait until he should ask her and yet she did not have the vanity to bring it up
the drummer however had another line of thought tonight and her little experience did not appeal to him as important
he let the conversation drop save for what she chose to recite without solicitation and carrie was not good at that
he took it for granted that she was doing very well and he was relieved of further worry
consequently he threw carrie into repression which was irritating
she felt his indifference keenly and longed to see hurstwood
it was as if he were now the only friend she had on earth
the next morning drouet was interested again but the damage had been done
she got a pretty letter from the manager saying that by the time she got it he would be waiting for her in the park
when she came he shone upon her as the morning sun
well my dear he asked how did you come out well enough she said still somewhat reduced after drouet
now tell me just what you did
was it pleasant carrie related the incidents of the rehearsal warming up as she proceeded
well thats delightful said hurstwood
im so glad
i must get over there to see you
when is the next rehearsal tuesday said carrie but they dont allow visitors i imagine i could get in said hurstwood significantly
she was completely restored and delighted by his consideration but she made him promise not to come around
now you must do your best to please me he said encouragingly
just remember that i want you to succeed
we will make the performance worth while
you do that now ill try said carrie brimming with affection and enthusiasm
thats the girl said hurstwood fondly
now remember shaking an affectionate finger at her your best i will she answered looking back
the whole earth was brimming sunshine that morning
she tripped along the clear sky pouring liquid blue into her soul
oh blessed are the children of endeavour in this that they try and are hopeful
and blessed also are they who knowing smile and approve
chapter xviii
just over the border a hail and farewell by the evening of the th the subtle hand of hurstwood had made itself apparent
he had given the word among his friendsand they were many and influentialthat here was something which they ought to attend and as a consequence the sale of tickets by mr quincel acting for the lodge had been large
small fourline notes had appeared in all of the daily newspapers
these he had arranged for by the aid of one of his newspaper friends on the times mr harry mcgarren the managing editor
say harry hurstwood said to him one evening as the latter stood at the bar drinking before wending his belated way homeward you can help the boys out i guess what is it said mcgarren pleased to be consulted by the opulent manager
the custer lodge is getting up a little entertainment for their own good and theyd like a little newspaper notice
you know what i meana squib or two saying that its going to take place certainly said mcgarren i can fix that for you george at the same time hurstwood kept himself wholly in the background
the members of custer lodge could scarcely understand why their little affair was taking so well
mr harry quincel was looked upon as quite a star for this sort of work
by the time the th had arrived hurstwoods friends had rallied like romans to a senators call
a welldressed goodnatured flatteringlyinclined audience was assured from the moment he thought of assisting carrie
that little student had mastered her part to her own satisfaction much as she trembled for her fate when she should once face the gathered throng behind the glare of the footlights
she tried to console herself with the thought that a score of other persons men and women were equally tremulous concerning the outcome of their efforts but she could not disassociate the general danger from her own individual liability
she feared that she would forget her lines that she might be unable to master the feeling which she now felt concerning her own movements in the play
at times she wished that she had never gone into the affair at others she trembled lest she should be paralysed with fear and stand white and gasping not knowing what to say and spoiling the entire performance
in the matter of the company mr bamberger had disappeared
that hopeless example had fallen under the lance of the directors criticism
mrs morgan was still present but envious and determined if for nothing more than spite to do as well as carrie at least
a loafing professional had been called in to assume the role of ray and while he was a poor stick of his kind he was not troubled by any of those qualms which attack the spirit of those who have never faced an audience
he swashed about cautioned though he was to maintain silence concerning his past theatrical relationships in such a selfconfident manner that he was like to convince every one of his identity by mere matter of circumstantial evidence
it is so easy he said to mrs morgan in the usual affected stage voice
an audience would be the last thing to trouble me
its the spirit of the part you know that is difficult carrie disliked his appearance but she was too much the actress not to swallow his qualities with complaisance seeing that she must suffer his fictitious love for the evening
at six she was ready to go
theatrical paraphernalia had been provided over and above her care
she had practised her makeup in the morning had rehearsed and arranged her material for the evening by one oclock and had gone home to have a final look at her part waiting for the evening to come
on this occasion the lodge sent a carriage
drouet rode with her as far as the door and then went about the neighbouring stores looking for some good cigars
the little actress marched nervously into her dressingroom and began that painfully anticipated matter of makeup which was to transform her a simple maiden to laura the belle of society
the flare of the gasjets the open trunks suggestive of travel and display the scattered contents of the makeup boxrouge pearl powder whiting burnt cork india ink pencils for the eyelids wigs scissors lookingglasses draperyin short all the nameless paraphernalia of disguise have a remarkable atmosphere of their own
since her arrival in the city many things had influenced her but always in a farremoved manner
this new atmosphere was more friendly
it was wholly unlike the great brilliant mansions which waved her coldly away permitting her only awe and distant wonder
this took her by the hand kindly as one who says my dear come in it opened for her as if for its own
she had wondered at the greatness of the names upon the billboards the marvel of the long notices in the papers the beauty of the dresses upon the stage the atmosphere of carriages flowers refinement
here was no illusion
here was an open door to see all of that
she had come upon it as one who stumbles upon a secret passage and behold she was in the chamber of diamonds and delight
as she dressed with a flutter in her little stage room hearing the voices outside seeing mr quincel hurrying here and there noting mrs morgan and mrs hoagland at their nervous work of preparation seeing all the twenty members of the cast moving about and worrying over what the result would be she could not help thinking what a delight this would be if it would endure how perfect a state if she could only do well now and then some time get a place as a real actress
the thought had taken a mighty hold upon her
it hummed in her ears as the melody of an old song
outside in the little lobby another scene was being enacted
without the interest of hurstwood the little hall would probably have been comfortably filled for the members of the lodge were moderately interested in its welfare
hurstwoods word however had gone the rounds
it was to be a fulldress affair
the four boxes had been taken
dr norman mcneill hale and his wife were to occupy one
this was quite a card
c r walker drygoods merchant and possessor of at least two hundred thousand dollars had taken another a wellknown coal merchant had been induced to take the third and hurstwood and his friends the fourth
among the latter was drouet
the people who were now pouring here were not celebrities nor even local notabilities in a general sense
they were the lights of a certain circlethe circle of small fortunes and secret order distinctions
these gentlemen elks knew the standing of one another
they had regard for the ability which could amass a small fortune own a nice home keep a barouche or carriage perhaps wear fine clothes and maintain a good mercantile position
naturally hurstwood who was a little above the order of mind which accepted this standard as perfect who had shrewdness and much assumption of dignity who held an imposing and authoritative position and commanded friendship by intuitive tact in handling people was quite a figure
he was more generally known than most others in the same circle and was looked upon as some one whose reserve covered a mine of influence and solid financial prosperity
tonight he was in his element
he came with several friends directly from rectors in a carriage
in the lobby he met drouet who was just returning from a trip for more cigars
all five now joined in an animated conversation concerning the company present and the general drift of lodge affairs
whos here said hurstwood passing into the theatre proper where the lights were turned up and a company of gentlemen were laughing and talking in the open space back of the seats
why how do you do mr hurstwood came from the first individual recognised
glad to see you said the latter grasping his hand lightly
looks quite an affair doesnt it yes indeed said the manager
custer seems to have the backing of its members observed the friend
so it should said the knowing manager
im glad to see it well george said another rotund citizen whose avoirdupois made necessary an almost alarming display of starched shirt bosom how goes it with you excellent said the manager
what brings you over here
youre not a member of custer goodnature returned the manager
like to see the boys you know wife here she couldnt come tonight
shes not well sorry to hear itnothing serious i hope no just feeling a little ill i remember mrs hurstwood when she was travelling once with you over to st joe and here the newcomer launched off in a trivial recollection which was terminated by the arrival of more friends
why george how are you said another genial west side politician and lodge member
my but im glad to see you again how are things anyhow very well i see you got that nomination for alderman yes we whipped them out over there without much trouble what do you suppose hennessy will do now oh hell go back to his brick business
he has a brickyard you know i didnt know that said the manager
felt pretty sore i suppose over his defeat perhaps said the other winking shrewdly
some of the more favoured of his friends whom he had invited began to roll up in carriages now
they came shuffling in with a great show of finery and much evident feeling of content and importance
here we are said hurstwood turning to one from a group with whom he was talking
thats right returned the newcomer a gentleman of about fortyfive
and say he whispered jovially pulling hurstwood over by the shoulder so that he might whisper in his ear if this isnt a good show ill punch your head you ought to pay for seeing your old friends
bother the show to another who inquired is it something really good the manager replied i dont know
i dont suppose so then lifting his hand graciously for the lodge lots of boys out eh yes look up shanahan
he was just asking for you a moment ago it was thus that the little theatre resounded to a babble of successful voices the creak of fine clothes the commonplace of goodnature and all largely because of this mans bidding
look at him any time within the half hour before the curtain was up he was a member of an eminent groupa rounded company of five or more whose stout figures large white bosoms and shining pins bespoke the character of their success
the gentlemen who brought their wives called him out to shake hands
seats clicked ushers bowed while he looked blandly on
he was evidently a light among them reflecting in his personality the ambitions of those who greeted him
he was acknowledged fawned upon in a way lionised
through it all one could see the standing of the man
it was greatness in a way small as it was
chapter xix
an hour in elfland a clamour half heard at last the curtain was ready to go up
all the details of the makeup had been completed and the company settled down as the leader of the small hired orchestra tapped significantly upon his music rack with his baton and began the soft curtainraising strain
hurstwood ceased talking and went with drouet and his friend sagar morrison around to the box
now well see how the little girl does he said to drouet in a tone which no one else could hear
on the stage six of the characters had already appeared in the opening parlour scene
drouet and hurstwood saw at a glance that carrie was not among them and went on talking in a whisper
mrs morgan mrs hoagland and the actor who had taken bambergers part were representing the principal rles in this scene
the professional whose name was patton had little to recommend him outside of his assurance but this at the present moment was most palpably needed
mrs morgan as pearl was stiff with fright
mrs hoagland was husky in the throat
the whole company was so weakkneed that the lines were merely spoken and nothing more
it took all the hope and uncritical goodnature of the audience to keep from manifesting pity by that unrest which is the agony of failure
hurstwood was perfectly indifferent
he took it for granted that it would be worthless
all he cared for was to have it endurable enough to allow for pretension and congratulation afterward
after the first rush of fright however the players got over the danger of collapse
they rambled weakly forward losing nearly all the expression which was intended and making the thing dull in the extreme when carrie came in
one glance at her and both hurstwood and drouet saw plainly that she also was weakkneed
she came faintly across the stage saying and you sir we have been looking for you since eight oclock but with so little colour and in such a feeble voice that it was positively painful
shes frightened whispered drouet to hurstwood
the manager made no answer
she had a line presently which was supposed to be funny
well thats as much as to say that im a sort of life pill it came out so flat however that it was a deathly thing
drouet fidgeted
hurstwood moved his toe the least bit
there was another place in which laura was to rise and with a sense of impending disaster say sadly i wish you hadnt said that pearl
you know the old proverb call a maid by a married name the lack of feeling in the thing was ridiculous
carrie did not get it at all
she seemed to be talking in her sleep
it looked as if she were certain to be a wretched failure
she was more hopeless than mrs morgan who had recovered somewhat and was now saying her lines clearly at least
drouet looked away from the stage at the audience
the latter held out silently hoping for a general change of course
hurstwood fixed his eye on carrie as if to hypnotise her into doing better
he was pouring determination of his own in her direction
he felt sorry for her
in a few more minutes it fell to her to read the letter sent in by the strange villain
the audience had been slightly diverted by a conversation between the professional actor and a character called snorky impersonated by a short little american who really developed some humour as a halfcrazed onearmed soldier turned messenger for a living
he bawled his lines out with such defiance that while they really did not partake of the humour intended they were funny
now he was off however and it was back to pathos with carrie as the chief figure
she did not recover
she wandered through the whole scene between herself and the intruding villain straining the patience of the audience and finally exiting much to their relief
shes too nervous said drouet feeling in the mildness of the remark that he was lying for once
better go back and say a word to her drouet was glad to do anything for relief
he fairly hustled around to the side entrance and was let in by the friendly doorkeeper
carrie was standing in the wings weakly waiting her next cue all the snap and nerve gone out of her
say cad he said looking at her you mustnt be nervous
wake up
those guys out there dont amount to anything
what are you afraid of i dont know said carrie
i just dont seem to be able to do it she was grateful for the drummers presence though
she had found the company so nervous that her own strength had gone
come on said drouet
brace up
what are you afraid of
go on out there now and do the trick
what do you care carrie revived a little under the drummers electrical nervous condition
did i do so very bad not a bit
all you need is a little more ginger
do it as you showed me
get that toss of your head you had the other night carrie remembered her triumph in the room
she tried to think she could to it
whats next he said looking at her part which she had been studying
why the scene between ray and me when i refuse him well now you do that lively said the drummer
put in snap thats the thing
act as if you didnt care your turn next miss madenda said the prompter
oh dear said carrie
well youre a chump for being afraid said drouet
come on now brace up
ill watch you from right here will you said carrie
yes now go on
dont be afraid the prompter signalled her
she started out weak as ever but suddenly her nerve partially returned
she thought of drouet looking
ray she said gently using a tone of voice much more calm than when she had last appeared
it was the scene which had pleased the director at the rehearsal
shes easier thought hurstwood to himself
she did not do the part as she had at rehearsal but she was better
the audience was at least not irritated
the improvement of the work of the entire company took away direct observation from her
they were making very fair progress and now it looked as if the play would be passable in the less trying parts at least
carrie came off warm and nervous
well she said looking at him was it any better well i should say so
thats the way
put life into it
you did that about a thousand per cent
better than you did the other scene
now go on and fire up
you can do it
knock em was it really better better i should say so
what comes next that ballroom scene well you can do that all right he said
i dont know answered carrie
why woman he exclaimed you did it for me
now you go out there and do it
itll be fun for you
just do as you did in the room
if youll reel it off that way ill bet you make a hit
now whatll you bet
you do it the drummer usually allowed his ardent goodnature to get the better of his speech
he really did think that carrie had acted this particular scene very well and he wanted her to repeat it in public
his enthusiasm was due to the mere spirit of the occasion
when the time came he buoyed carrie up most effectually
he began to make her feel as if she had done very well
the old melancholy of desire began to come back as he talked at her and by the time the situation rolled around she was running high in feeling
i think i can do this sure you can
now you go ahead and see on the stage mrs van dam was making her cruel insinuation against laura
carrie listened and caught the infection of somethingshe did not know what
her nostrils sniffed thinly
it means the professional actor began speaking as ray that society is a terrible avenger of insult
have you ever heard of the siberian wolves
when one of the pack falls through weakness the others devour him
it is not an elegant comparison but there is something wolfish in society
laura has mocked it with a pretence and society which is made up of pretence will bitterly resent the mockery at the sound of her stage name carrie started
she began to feel the bitterness of the situation
the feelings of the outcast descended upon her
she hung at the wings edge wrapt in her own mounting thoughts
she hardly heard anything more save her own rumbling blood
come girls said mrs van dam solemnly let us look after our things
they are no longer safe when such an accomplished thief enters cue said the prompter close to her side but she did not hear
already she was moving forward with a steady grace born of inspiration
she dawned upon the audience handsome and proud shifting with the necessity of the situation to a cold white helpless object as the social pack moved away from her scornfully
hurstwood blinked his eyes and caught the infection
the radiating waves of feeling and sincerity were already breaking against the farthest walls of the chamber
the magic of passion which will yet dissolve the world was here at work
there was a drawing too of attention a riveting of feeling heretofore wandering
ray
ray
why do you not come back to her was the cry of pearl
every eye was fixed on carrie still proud and scornful
they moved as she moved
their eyes were with her eyes
mrs morgan as pearl approached her
let us go home she said
no answered carrie her voice assuming for the first time a penetrating quality which it had never known
stay with him she pointed an almost accusing hand toward her lover
then with a pathos which struck home because of its utter simplicity he shall not suffer long hurstwood realised that he was seeing something extraordinarily good
it was heightened for him by the applause of the audience as the curtain descended and the fact that it was carrie
he thought now that she was beautiful
she had done something which was above his sphere
he felt a keen delight in realising that she was his
fine he said and then seized by a sudden impulse arose and went about to the stage door
when he came in upon carrie she was still with drouet
his feelings for her were most exuberant
he was almost swept away by the strength and feeling she exhibited
his desire was to pour forth his praise with the unbounded feelings of a lover but here was drouet whose affection was also rapidly reviving
the latter was more fascinated if anything than hurstwood
at least in the nature of things it took a more ruddy form
well well said drouet you did out of sight
that was simply great
i knew you could do it
oh but youre a little daisy carries eyes flamed with the light of achievement
did i do all right did you
well i guess
didnt you hear the applause there was some faint sound of clapping yet
i thought i got it something likei felt it just then hurstwood came in
instinctively he felt the change in drouet
he saw that the drummer was near to carrie and jealousy leaped alight in his bosom
in a flash of thought he reproached himself for having sent him back
also he hated him as an intruder
he could scarcely pull himself down to the level where he would have to congratulate carrie as a friend
nevertheless the man mastered himself and it was a triumph
he almost jerked the old subtle light to his eyes
i thought he said looking at carrie i would come around and tell you how well you did mrs drouet
it was delightful carrie took the cue and replied oh thank you i was just telling her put in drouet now delighted with his possession that i thought she did fine indeed you did said hurstwood turning upon carrie eyes in which she read more than the words
carrie laughed luxuriantly
if you do as well in the rest of the play you will make us all think you are a born actress carrie smiled again
she felt the acuteness of hurstwoods position and wished deeply that she could be alone with him but she did not understand the change in drouet
hurstwood found that he could not talk repressed as he was and grudging drouet every moment of his presence he bowed himself out with the elegance of a faust
outside he set his teeth with envy
damn it he said is he always going to be in the way he was moody when he got back to the box and could not talk for thinking of his wretched situation
as the curtain for the next act arose drouet came back
he was very much enlivened in temper and inclined to whisper but hurstwood pretended interest
he fixed his eyes on the stage although carrie was not there a short bit of melodramatic comedy preceding her entrance
he did not see what was going on however
he was thinking his own thoughts and they were wretched
the progress of the play did not improve matters for him
carrie from now on was easily the centre of interest
the audience which had been inclined to feel that nothing could be good after the first gloomy impression now went to the other extreme and saw power where it was not
the general feeling reacted on carrie
she presented her part with some felicity though nothing like the intensity which had aroused the feeling at the end of the long first act
both hurstwood and drouet viewed her pretty figure with rising feelings
the fact that such ability should reveal itself in her that they should see it set forth under such effective circumstances framed almost in massy gold and shone upon by the appropriate lights of sentiment and personality heightened her charm for them
she was more than the old carrie to drouet
he longed to be at home with her until he could tell her
he awaited impatiently the end when they should go home alone
hurstwood on the contrary saw in the strength of her new attractiveness his miserable predicament
he could have cursed the man beside him
by the lord he could not even applaud feelingly as he would
for once he must simulate when it left a taste in his mouth
it was in the last act that carries fascination for her lovers assumed its most effective character
hurstwood listened to its progress wondering when carrie would come on
he had not long to wait
the author had used the artifice of sending all the merry company for a drive and now carrie came in alone
it was the first time that hurstwood had had a chance to see her facing the audience quite alone for nowhere else had she been without a foil of some sort
he suddenly felt as she entered that her old strengththe power that had grasped him at the end of the first acthad come back
she seemed to be gaining feeling now that the play was drawing to a close and the opportunity for great action was passing
poor pearl she said speaking with natural pathos
it is a sad thing to want for happiness but it is a terrible thing to see another groping about blindly for it when it is almost within the grasp she was gazing now sadly out upon the open sea her arm resting listlessly upon the polished doorpost
hurstwood began to feel a deep sympathy for her and for himself
he could almost feel that she was talking to him
he was by a combination of feelings and entanglements almost deluded by that quality of voice and manner which like a pathetic strain of music seems ever a personal and intimate thing
pathos has this quality that it seems ever addressed to one alone
and yet she can be very happy with him went on the little actress
her sunny temper her joyous face will brighten any home she turned slowly toward the audience without seeing
there was so much simplicity in her movements that she seemed wholly alone
then she found a seat by a table and turned over some books devoting a thought to them
with no longings for what i may not have she breathed in conclusionand it was almost a sighmy existence hidden from all save two in the wide world and making my joy out of the joy of that innocent girl who will soon be his wife hurstwood was sorry when a character known as peach blossom interrupted her
he stirred irritably for he wished her to go on
he was charmed by the pale face the lissome figure draped in pearl grey with a coiled string of pearls at the throat
carrie had the air of one who was weary and in need of protection and under the fascinating makebelieve of the moment he rose in feeling until he was ready in spirit to go to her and ease her out of her misery by adding to his own delight
in a moment carrie was alone again and was saying with animation i must return to the city no matter what dangers may lurk here
i must go secretly if i can openly if i must there was a sound of horses hoofs outside and then rays voice saying no i shall not ride again
put him up he entered and then began a scene which had as much to do with the creation of the tragedy of affection in hurstwood as anything in his peculiar and involved career
for carrie had resolved to make something of this scene and now that the cue had come it began to take a feeling hold upon her
both hurstwood and drouet noted the rising sentiment as she proceeded
i thought you had gone with pearl she said to her lover
i did go part of the way but i left the party a mile down the road you and pearl had no disagreement noyes that is we always have
our social barometers always stand at cloudy and overcast and whose fault is that she said easily
not mine he answered pettishly
i know i do all i cani say all i canbut she this was rather awkwardly put by patton but carrie redeemed it with a grace which was inspiring
but she is your wife she said fixing her whole attention upon the stilled actor and softening the quality of her voice until it was again low and musical
ray my friend courtship is the text from which the whole sermon of married life takes its theme
do not let yours be discontented and unhappy she put her two little hands together and pressed them appealingly
hurstwood gazed with slightly parted lips
drouet was fidgeting with satisfaction
to be my wife yes went on the actor in a manner which was weak by comparison but which could not now spoil the tender atmosphere which carrie had created and maintained
she did not seem to feel that he was wretched
she would have done nearly as well with a block of wood
the accessories she needed were within her own imagination
the acting of others could not affect them
and you repent already she said slowly
i lost you he said seizing her little hand and i was at the mercy of any flirt who chose to give me an inviting look
it was your faultyou know it waswhy did you leave me carrie turned slowly away and seemed to be mastering some impulse in silence
then she turned back
ray she said the greatest happiness i have ever felt has been the thought that all your affection was forever bestowed upon a virtuous woman your equal in family fortune and accomplishments
what a revelation do you make to me now
what is it makes you continually war with your happiness the last question was asked so simply that it came to the audience and the lover as a personal thing
at last it came to the part where the lover exclaimed be to me as you used to be carrie answered with affecting sweetness i cannot be that to you but i can speak in the spirit of the laura who is dead to you forever be it as you will said patton
hurstwood leaned forward
the whole audience was silent and intent
let the woman you look upon be wise or vain said carrie her eyes bent sadly upon the lover who had sunk into a seat beautiful or homely rich or poor she has but one thing she can really give or refuseher heart drouet felt a scratch in his throat
her beauty her wit her accomplishments she may sell to you but her love is the treasure without money and without price the manager suffered this as a personal appeal
it came to him as if they were alone and he could hardly restrain the tears for sorrow over the hopeless pathetic and yet dainty and appealing woman whom he loved
drouet also was beside himself
he was resolving that he would be to carrie what he had never been before
he would marry her by george
she was worth it
she asks only in return said carrie scarcely hearing the small scheduled reply of her lover and putting herself even more in harmony with the plaintive melody now issuing from the orchestra that when you look upon her your eyes shall speak devotion that when you address her your voice shall be gentle loving and kind that you shall not despise her because she cannot understand all at once your vigorous thoughts and ambitious designs for when misfortune and evil have defeated your greatest purposes her love remains to console you
you look to the trees she continued while hurstwood restrained his feelings only by the grimmest repression for strength and grandeur do not despise the flowers because their fragrance is all they have to give
remember she concluded tenderly love is all a woman has to give and she laid a strange sweet accent on the all but it is the only thing which god permits us to carry beyond the grave the two men were in the most harrowed state of affection
they scarcely heard the few remaining words with which the scene concluded
they only saw their idol moving about with appealing grace continuing a power which to them was a revelation
hurstwood resolved a thousands things drouet as well
they joined equally in the burst of applause which called carrie out
drouet pounded his hands until they ached
then he jumped up again and started out
as he went carrie came out and seeing an immense basket of flowers being hurried down the aisle toward her she waited
they were hurstwoods
she looked toward the managers box for a moment caught his eye and smiled
he could have leaped out of the box to enfold her
he forgot the need of circumspectness which his married state enforced
he almost forgot that he had with him in the box those who knew him
by the lord he would have that lovely girl if it took his all
he would act at once
this should be the end of drouet and dont you forget it
he would not wait another day
the drummer should not have her
he was so excited that he could not stay in the box
he went into the lobby and then into the street thinking
drouet did not return
in a few minutes the last act was over and he was crazy to have carrie alone
he cursed the luck that could keep him smiling bowing shamming when he wanted to tell her that he loved her when he wanted to whisper to her alone
he groaned as he saw that his hopes were futile
he must even take her to supper shamming
he finally went about and asked how she was getting along
the actors were all dressing talking hurrying about
drouet was palavering himself with the looseness of excitement and passion
the manager mastered himself only by a great effort
we are going to supper of course he said with a voice that was a mockery of his heart
oh yes said carrie smiling
the little actress was in fine feather
she was realising now what it was to be petted
for once she was the admired the soughtfor
the independence of success now made its first faint showing
with the tables turned she was looking down rather than up to her lover
she did not fully realise that this was so but there was something in condescension coming from her which was infinitely sweet
when she was ready they climbed into the waiting coach and drove down town once only did she find an opportunity to express her feeling and that was when the manager preceded drouet in the coach and sat beside her
before drouet was fully in she had squeezed hurstwoods hand in a gentle impulsive manner
the manager was beside himself with affection
he could have sold his soul to be with her alone
ah he thought the agony of it drouet hung on thinking he was all in all
the dinner was spoiled by his enthusiasm
hurstwood went home feeling as if he should die if he did not find affectionate relief
he whispered tomorrow passionately to carrie and she understood
he walked away from the drummer and his prize at parting feeling as if he could slay him and not regret
carrie also felt the misery of it
goodnight he said simulating an easy friendliness
goodnight said the little actress tenderly
the fool he said now hating drouet
the idiot
ill do him yet and that quick
well see tomorrow well if you arent a wonder drouet was saying complacently squeezing carries arm
you are the dandiest little girl on earth chapter xx
the lure of the spirit the flesh in pursuit passion in a man of hurstwoods nature takes a vigorous form
it is no musing dreamy thing
there is none of the tendency to sing outside of my ladys windowto languish and repine in the face of difficulties
in the night he was long getting to sleep because of too much thinking and in the morning he was early awake seizing with alacrity upon the same dear subject and pursuing it with vigour
he was out of sorts physically as well as disordered mentally for did he not delight in a new manner in his carrie and was not drouet in the way
never was man more harassed than he by the thoughts of his love being held by the elated flushmannered drummer
he would have given anything it seemed to him to have the complication endedto have carrie acquiesce to an arrangement which would dispose of drouet effectually and forever
what to do
he dressed thinking
he moved about in the same chamber with his wife unmindful of her presence
at breakfast he found himself without an appetite
the meat to which he helped himself remained on his plate untouched
his coffee grew cold while he scanned the paper indifferently
here and there he read a little thing but remembered nothing
jessica had not yet come down
his wife sat at one end of the table revolving thoughts of her own in silence
a new servant had been recently installed and had forgot the napkins
on this account the silence was irritably broken by a reproof
ive told you about this before maggie said mrs hurstwood
im not going to tell you again hurstwood took a glance at his wife
she was frowning
just now her manner irritated him excessively
her next remark was addressed to him
have you made up your mind george when you will take your vacation it was customary for them to discuss the regular summer outing at this season of the year
not yet he said im very busy just now well youll want to make up your mind pretty soon wont you if were going she returned
i guess we have a few days yet he said
hmff she returned
dont wait until the seasons over she stirred in aggravation as she said this
there you go again he observed
one would think i never did anything the way you begin well i want to know about it she reiterated
youve got a few days yet he insisted
youll not want to start before the races are over he was irritated to think that this should come up when he wished to have his thoughts for other purposes
well we may
jessica doesnt want to stay until the end of the races what did you want with a season ticket then uh she said using the sound as an exclamation of disgust ill not argue with you and therewith arose to leave the table
say he said rising putting a note of determination in his voice which caused her to delay her departure whats the matter with you of late
cant i talk with you any more certainly you can talk with me she replied laying emphasis on the word
well you wouldnt think so by the way you act
now you want to know when ill be readynot for a month yet
maybe not then well go without you you will eh he sneered
yes we will he was astonished at the womans determination but it only irritated him the more
well well see about that
it seems to me youre trying to run things with a pretty high hand of late
you talk as though you settled my affairs for me
well you dont
you dont regulate anything thats connected with me
if you want to go go but you wont hurry me by any such talk as that he was thoroughly aroused now
his dark eyes snapped and he crunched his paper as he laid it down
mrs hurstwood said nothing more
he was just finishing when she turned on her heel and went out into the hall and upstairs
he paused for a moment as if hesitating then sat down and drank a little coffee and thereafter arose and went for his hat and gloves upon the main floor
his wife had really not anticipated a row of this character
she had come down to the breakfast table feeling a little out of sorts with herself and revolving a scheme which she had in her mind
jessica had called her attention to the fact that the races were not what they were supposed to be
the social opportunities were not what they had thought they would be this year
the beautiful girl found going every day a dull thing
there was an earlier exodus this year of people who were anybody to the watering places and europe
in her own circle of acquaintances several young men in whom she was interested had gone to waukesha
she began to feel that she would like to go too and her mother agreed with her
accordingly mrs hurstwood decided to broach the subject
she was thinking this over when she came down to the table but for some reason the atmosphere was wrong
she was not sure after it was all over just how the trouble had begun
she was determined now however that her husband was a brute and that under no circumstances would she let this go by unsettled
she would have more ladylike treatment or she would know why
for his part the manager was loaded with the care of this new argument until he reached his office and started from there to meet carrie
then the other complications of love desire and opposition possessed him
his thoughts fled on before him upon eagles wings
he could hardly wait until he should meet carrie face to face
what was the night after all without herwhat the day
she must and should be his
for her part carrie had experienced a world of fancy and feeling since she had left him the night before
she had listened to drouets enthusiastic maunderings with much regard for that part which concerned herself with very little for that which affected his own gain
she kept him at such lengths as she could because her thoughts were with her own triumph
she felt hurstwoods passion as a delightful background to her own achievement and she wondered what he would have to say
she was sorry for him too with that peculiar sorrow which finds something complimentary to itself in the misery of another
she was now experiencing the first shades of feeling of that subtle change which removes one out of the ranks of the suppliants into the lines of the dispensers of charity
she was all in all exceedingly happy
on the morrow however there was nothing in the papers concerning the event and in view of the flow of common everyday things about it now lost a shade of the glow of the previous evening
drouet himself was not talking so much of as for her
he felt instinctively that for some reason or other he needed reconstruction in her regard
i think he said as he spruced around their chambers the next morning preparatory to going down town that ill straighten out that little deal of mine this month and then well get married
i was talking with mosher about that yesterday no you wont said carrie who was coming to feel a certain faint power to jest with the drummer
yes i will he exclaimed more feelingly than usual adding with the tone of one who pleads dont you believe what ive told you carrie laughed a little
of course i do she answered
drouets assurance now misgave him
shallow as was his mental observation there was that in the things which had happened which made his little power of analysis useless
carrie was still with him but not helpless and pleading
there was a lilt in her voice which was new
she did not study him with eyes expressive of dependence
the drummer was feeling the shadow of something which was coming
it coloured his feelings and made him develop those little attentions and say those little words which were mere forefendations against danger
shortly afterward he departed and carrie prepared for her meeting with hurstwood
she hurried at her toilet which was soon made and hastened down the stairs
at the corner she passed drouet but they did not see each other
the drummer had forgotten some bills which he wished to turn into his house
he hastened up the stairs and burst into the room but found only the chambermaid who was cleaning up
hello he exclaimed half to himself has carrie gone your wife
yes she went out just a few minutes ago thats strange thought drouet
she didnt say a word to me
i wonder where she went he hastened about rummaging in his valise for what he wanted and finally pocketing it
then he turned his attention to his fair neighbour who was goodlooking and kindly disposed towards him
what are you up to he said smiling
just cleaning she replied stopping and winding a dusting towel about her hand
tired of it not so very let me show you something he said affably coming over and taking out of his pocket a little lithographed card which had been issued by a wholesale tobacco company
on this was printed a picture of a pretty girl holding a striped parasol the colours of which could be changed by means of a revolving disk in the back which showed red yellow green and blue through little interstices made in the ground occupied by the umbrella top
isnt that clever he said handing it to her and showing her how it worked
you never saw anything like that before isnt it nice she answered
you can have it if you want it he remarked
thats a pretty ring you have he said touching a commonplace setting which adorned the hand holding the card he had given her
do you think so thats right he answered making use of a pretence at examination to secure her finger
thats fine the ice being thus broken he launched into further observation pretending to forget that her fingers were still retained by his
she soon withdrew them however and retreated a few feet to rest against the windowsill
i didnt see you for a long time she said coquettishly repulsing one of his exuberant approaches
you must have been away i was said drouet
do you travel far pretty faryes do you like it oh not very well
you get tired of it after a while i wish i could travel said the girl gazing idly out of the window
what has become of your friend mr hurstwood she suddenly asked bethinking herself of the manager who from her own observation seemed to contain promising material
hes here in town
what makes you ask about him oh nothing only he hasnt been here since you got back how did you come to know him didnt i take up his name a dozen times in the last month get out said the drummer lightly
he hasnt called more than half a dozen times since weve been here he hasnt eh said the girl smiling
thats all you know about it drouet took on a slightly more serious tone
he was uncertain as to whether she was joking or not
tease he said what makes you smile that way oh nothing have you seen him recently not since you came back she laughed
before certainly how often why nearly every day she was a mischievous newsmonger and was keenly wondering what the effect of her words would be
who did he come to see asked the drummer incredulously
mrs
drouet he looked rather foolish at this answer and then attempted to correct himself so as not to appear a dupe
well he said what of it nothing replied the girl her head cocked coquettishly on one side
hes an old friend he went on getting deeper into the mire
he would have gone on further with his little flirtation but the taste for it was temporarily removed
he was quite relieved when the girls named was called from below
ive got to go she said moving away from him airily
ill see you later he said with a pretence of disturbance at being interrupted
when she was gone he gave freer play to his feelings
his face never easily controlled by him expressed all the perplexity and disturbance which he felt
could it be that carrie had received so many visits and yet said nothing about them
was hurstwood lying
what did the chambermaid mean by it anyway
he had thought there was something odd about carries manner at the time
why did she look so disturbed when he had asked her how many times hurstwood had called
by george
he remembered now
there was something strange about the whole thing
he sat down in a rockingchair to think the better drawing up one leg on his knee and frowning mightily
his mind ran on at a great rate
and yet carrie hadnt acted out of the ordinary
it couldnt be by george that she was deceiving him
she hadnt acted that way
why even last night she had been as friendly toward him as could be and hurstwood too
look how they acted
he could hardly believe they would try to deceive him
his thoughts burst into words
she did act sort of funny at times
here she had dressed and gone out this morning and never said a word he scratched his head and prepared to go down town
he was still frowning
as he came into the hall he encountered the girl who was now looking after another chamber
she had on a white dusting cap beneath which her chubby face shone goodnaturedly
drouet almost forgot his worry in the fact that she was smiling on him
he put his hand familiarly on her shoulder as if only to greet her in passing
got over being mad she said still mischievously inclined
im not mad he answered
i thought you were she said smiling
quit your fooling about that he said in an offhand way
were you serious certainly she answered
then with an air of one who did not intentionally mean to create trouble he came lots of times
i thought you knew the game of deception was up with drouet
he did not try to simulate indifference further
did he spend the evenings here he asked
sometimes
sometimes they went out in the evening yes
you mustnt look so mad though im not he said
did any one else see him of course said the girl as if after all it were nothing in particular
how long ago was this just before you came back the drummer pinched his lip nervously
dont say anything will you he asked giving the girls arm a gentle squeeze
certainly not she returned
i wouldnt worry over it all right he said passing on seriously brooding for once and yet not wholly unconscious of the fact that he was making a most excellent impression upon the chambermaid
ill see her about that he said to himself passionately feeling that he had been unduly wronged
ill find out bgeorge whether shell act that way or not chapter xxi
the lure of the spirit the flesh in pursuit when carrie came hurstwood had been waiting many minutes
his blood was warm his nerves wrought up
he was anxious to see the woman who had stirred him so profoundly the night before
here you are he said repressedly feeling a spring in his limbs and an elation which was tragic in itself
yes said carrie
they walked on as if bound for some objective point while hurstwood drank in the radiance of her presence
the rustle of her pretty skirt was like music to him
are you satisfied he asked thinking of how well she did the night before
are you he tightened his fingers as he saw the smile she gave him
it was wonderful carrie laughed ecstatically
that was one of the best things ive seen in a long time he added
he was dwelling on her attractiveness as he had felt it the evening before and mingling it with the feeling her presence inspired now
carrie was dwelling in the atmosphere which this man created for her
already she was enlivened and suffused with a glow
she felt his drawing toward her in every sound of his voice
those were such nice flowers you sent me she said after a moment or two
they were beautiful glad you liked them he answered simply
he was thinking all the time that the subject of his desire was being delayed
he was anxious to turn the talk to his own feelings
all was ripe for it
his carrie was beside him
he wanted to plunge in and expostulate with her and yet he found himself fishing for words and feeling for a way
you got home all right he said gloomily of a sudden his tune modifying itself to one of selfcommiseration
yes said carrie easily
he looked at her steadily for a moment slowing his pace and fixing her with his eye
she felt the flood of feeling
how about me he asked
this confused carrie considerably for she realised the floodgates were open
she didnt know exactly what to answer
i dont know she answered
he took his lower lip between his teeth for a moment and then let it go
he stopped by the walk side and kicked the grass with his toe
he searched her face with a tender appealing glance
wont you come away from him he asked intensely
i dont know returned carrie still illogically drifting and finding nothing at which to catch
as a matter of fact she was in a most hopeless quandary
here was a man whom she thoroughly liked who exercised an influence over her sufficient almost to delude her into the belief that she was possessed of a lively passion for him
she was still the victim of his keen eyes his suave manners his fine clothes
she looked and saw before her a man who was most gracious and sympathetic who leaned toward her with a feeling that was a delight to observe
she could not resist the glow of his temperament the light of his eye
she could hardly keep from feeling what he felt
and yet she was not without thoughts which were disturbing
what did he know
what had drouet told him
was she a wife in his eyes or what
would he marry her
even while he talked and she softened and her eyes were lighted with a tender glow she was asking herself if drouet had told him they were not married
there was never anything at all convincing about what drouet said
and yet she was not grieved at hurstwoods love
no strain of bitterness was in it for her whatever he knew
he was evidently sincere
his passion was real and warm
there was power in what he said
what should she do
she went on thinking this answering vaguely languishing affectionately and altogether drifting until she was on a borderless sea of speculation
why dont you come away he said tenderly
i will arrange for you whatever oh dont said carrie
dont what he asked
what do you mean there was a look of confusion and pain in her face
she was wondering why that miserable thought must be brought in
she was struck as by a blade with the miserable provision which was outside the pale of marriage
he himself realized that it was a wretched thing to have dragged in
he wanted to weigh the effects of it and yet he could not see
he went beating on flushed by her presence clearly awakened intensely enlisted in his plan
wont you come he said beginning over and with a more reverent feeling
you know i cant do without youyou know itit cant go on this waycan it i know said carrie
i wouldnt ask if ii wouldnt argue with you if i could help it
look at me carrie
put yourself in my place
you dont want to stay away from me do you she shook her head as if in deep thought
then why not settle the whole thing once and for all i dont know said carrie
dont know
ah carrie what makes you say that
dont torment me
be serious i am said carrie softly
you cant be dearest and say that
not when you know how i love you
look at last night his manner as he said this was the most quiet imaginable
his face and body retained utter composure
only his eyes moved and they flashed a subtle dissolving fire
in them the whole intensity of the mans nature was distilling itself
carrie made no answer
how can you act this way dearest he inquired after a time
you love me dont you he turned on her such a storm of feeling that she was overwhelmed
for the moment all doubts were cleared away
yes she answered frankly and tenderly
well then youll come wont youcome tonight carrie shook her head in spite of her distress
i cant wait any longer urged hurstwood
if that is too soon come saturday when will we be married she asked diffidently forgetting in her difficult situation that she had hoped he took her to be drouets wife
the manager started hit as he was by a problem which was more difficult than hers
he gave no sign of the thoughts that flashed like messages to his mind
any time you say he said with ease refusing to discolour his present delight with this miserable problem
saturday asked carrie
he nodded his head
well if you will marry me then she said ill go the manager looked at his lovely prize so beautiful so winsome so difficult to be won and made strange resolutions
his passion had gotten to that stage now where it was no longer coloured with reason
he did not trouble over little barriers of this sort in the face of so much loveliness
he would accept the situation with all its difficulties he would not try to answer the objections which cold truth thrust upon him
he would promise anything everything and trust to fortune to disentangle him
he would make a try for paradise whatever might be the result
he would be happy by the lord if it cost all honesty of statement all abandonment of truth
carrie looked at him tenderly
she could have laid her head upon his shoulder so delightful did it all seem
well she said ill try and get ready then hurstwood looked into her pretty face crossed with little shadows of wonder and misgiving and thought he had never seen anything more lovely
ill see you again tomorrow he said joyously and well talk over the plans he walked on with her elated beyond words so delightful had been the result
he impressed a long story of joy and affection upon her though there was but here and there a word
after a halfhour he began to realise that the meeting must come to an end so exacting is the world
tomorrow he said at parting a gayety of manner adding wonderfully to his brave demeanour
yes said carrie tripping elatedly away
there had been so much enthusiasm engendered that she was believing herself deeply in love
she sighed as she thought of her handsome adorer
yes she would get ready by saturday
she would go and they would be happy
chapter xxii
the blaze of the tinder flesh wars with the flesh the misfortune of the hurstwood household was due to the fact that jealousy having been born of love did not perish with it
mrs hurstwood retained this in such form that subsequent influences could transform it into hate
hurstwood was still worthy in a physical sense of the affection his wife had once bestowed upon him but in a social sense he fell short
with his regard died his power to be attentive to her and this to a woman is much greater than outright crime toward another
our selflove dictates our appreciation of the good or evil in another
in mrs hurstwood it discoloured the very hue of her husbands indifferent nature
she saw design in deeds and phrases which sprung only from a faded appreciation of her presence
as a consequence she was resentful and suspicious
the jealousy that prompted her to observe every falling away from the little amenities of the married relation on his part served to give her notice of the airy grace with which he still took the world
she could see from the scrupulous care which he exercised in the matter of his personal appearance that his interest in life had abated not a jot
every motion every glance had something in it of the pleasure he felt in carrie of the zest this new pursuit of pleasure lent to his days
mrs hurstwood felt something sniffing change as animals do danger afar off
this feeling was strengthened by actions of a direct and more potent nature on the part of hurstwood
we have seen with what irritation he shirked those little duties which no longer contained any amusement of satisfaction for him and the open snarls with which more recently he resented her irritating goads
these little rows were really precipitated by an atmosphere which was surcharged with dissension
that it would shower with a sky so full of blackening thunderclouds would scarcely be thought worthy of comment
thus after leaving the breakfast table this morning raging inwardly at his blank declaration of indifference at her plans mrs hurstwood encountered jessica in her dressingroom very leisurely arranging her hair
hurstwood had already left the house
i wish you wouldnt be so late coming down to breakfast she said addressing jessica while making for her crochet basket
now here the things are quite cold and you havent eaten her natural composure was sadly ruffled and jessica was doomed to feel the fag end of the storm
im not hungry she answered
then why dont you say so and let the girl put away the things instead of keeping her waiting all morning she doesnt mind answered jessica coolly
well i do if she doesnt returned the mother and anyhow i dont like you to talk that way to me
youre too young to put on such an air with your mother oh mamma dont row answered jessica
whats the matter this morning anyway nothings the matter and im not rowing
you mustnt think because i indulge you in some things that you can keep everybody waiting
i wont have it im not keeping anybody waiting returned jessica sharply stirred out of a cynical indifference to a sharp defence
i said i wasnt hungry
i dont want any breakfast mind how you address me missy
ill not have it
hear me now ill not have it jessica heard this last while walking out of the room with a toss of her head and a flick of her pretty skirts indicative of the independence and indifference she felt
she did not propose to be quarrelled with
such little arguments were all too frequent the result of a growth of natures which were largely independent and selfish
george jr manifested even greater touchiness and exaggeration in the matter of his individual rights and attempted to make all feel that he was a man with a mans privilegesan assumption which of all things is most groundless and pointless in a youth of nineteen
hurstwood was a man of authority and some fine feeling and it irritated him excessively to find himself surrounded more and more by a world upon which he had no hold and of which he had a lessening understanding
now when such little things such as the proposed earlier start to waukesha came up they made clear to him his position
he was being made to follow was not leading
when in addition a sharp temper was manifested and to the process of shouldering him out of his authority was added a rousing intellectual kick such as a sneer or a cynical laugh he was unable to keep his temper
he flew into hardly repressed passion and wished himself clear of the whole household
it seemed a most irritating drag upon all his desires and opportunities
for all this he still retained the semblance of leadership and control even though his wife was straining to revolt
her display of temper and open assertion of opposition were based upon nothing more than the feeling that she could do it
she had no special evidence wherewith to justify herselfthe knowledge of something which would give her both authority and excuse
the latter was all that was lacking however to give a solid foundation to what in a way seemed groundless discontent
the clear proof of one overt deed was the cold breath needed to convert the lowering clouds of suspicion into a rain of wrath
an inkling of untoward deeds on the part of hurstwood had come
doctor beale the handsome resident physician of the neighbourhood met mrs hurstwood at her own doorstep some days after hurstwood and carrie had taken the drive west on washington boulevard
dr beale coming east on the same drive had recognised hurstwood but not before he was quite past him
he was not so sure of carriedid not know whether it was hurstwoods wife or daughter
you dont speak to your friends when you meet them out driving do you he said jocosely to mrs hurstwood
if i see them i do
where was i on washington boulevard he answered expecting her eye to light with immediate remembrance
she shook her head
yes out near hoyne avenue
you were with your husband i guess youre mistaken she answered
then remembering her husbands part in the affair she immediately fell a prey to a host of young suspicions of which however she gave no sign
i know i saw your husband he went on
i wasnt so sure about you
perhaps it was your daughter perhaps it was said mrs hurstwood knowing full well that such was not the case as jessica had been her companion for weeks
she had recovered herself sufficiently to wish to know more of the details
was it in the afternoon she asked artfully assuming an air of acquaintanceship with the matter
yes about two or three it must have been jessica said mrs hurstwood not wishing to seem to attach any importance to the incident
the physician had a thought or two of his own but dismissed the matter as worthy of no further discussion on his part at least
mrs hurstwood gave this bit of information considerable thought during the next few hours and even days
she took it for granted that the doctor had really seen her husband and that he had been riding most likely with some other woman after announcing himself as busy to her
as a consequence she recalled with rising feeling how often he had refused to go to places with her to share in little visits or indeed take part in any of the social amenities which furnished the diversion of her existence
he had been seen at the theatre with people whom he called moys friends now he was seen driving and most likely would have an excuse for that
perhaps there were others of whom she did not hear or why should he be so busy so indifferent of late
in the last six weeks he had become strangely irritablestrangely satisfied to pick up and go out whether things were right or wrong in the house
why
she recalled with more subtle emotions that he did not look at her now with any of the old light of satisfaction or approval in his eye
evidently along with other things he was taking her to be getting old and uninteresting
he saw her wrinkles perhaps
she was fading while he was still preening himself in his elegance and youth
he was still an interested factor in the merrymakings of the world while shebut she did not pursue the thought
she only found the whole situation bitter and hated him for it thoroughly
nothing came of this incident at the time for the truth is it did not seem conclusive enough to warrant any discussion
only the atmosphere of distrust and illfeeling was strengthened precipitating every now and then little sprinklings of irritable conversation enlivened by flashes of wrath
the matter of the waukesha outing was merely a continuation of other things of the same nature
the day after carries appearance on the avery stage mrs hurstwood visited the races with jessica and a youth of her acquaintance mr bart taylor the son of the owner of a local housefurnishing establishment
they had driven out early and as it chanced encountered several friends of hurstwood all elks and two of whom had attended the performance the evening before
a thousand chances the subject of the performance had never been brought up had jessica not been so engaged by the attentions of her young companion who usurped as much time as possible
this left mrs hurstwood in the mood to extend the perfunctory greetings of some who knew her into short conversations and the short conversations of friends into long ones
it was from one who meant but to greet her perfunctorily that this interesting intelligence came
i see said this individual who wore sporting clothes of the most attractive pattern and had a fieldglass strung over his shoulder that you did not get over to our little entertainment last evening no said mrs hurstwood inquiringly and wondering why he should be using the tone he did in noting the fact that she had not been to something she knew nothing about
it was on her lips to say what was it when he added i saw your husband her wonder was at once replaced by the more subtle quality of suspicion
yes she said cautiously was it pleasant
he did not tell me much about it very
really one of the best private theatricals i ever attended
there was one actress who surprised us all indeed said mrs hurstwood
its too bad you couldnt have been there really
i was sorry to hear you werent feeling well feeling well
mrs hurstwood could have echoed the words after him openmouthed
as it was she extricated herself from her mingled impulse to deny and question and said almost raspingly yes it is too bad looks like there will be quite a crowd here today doesnt it the acquaintance observed drifting off upon another topic
the managers wife would have questioned farther but she saw no opportunity
she was for the moment wholly at sea anxious to think for herself and wondering what new deception was this which caused him to give out that she was ill when she was not
another case of her company not wanted and excuses being made
she resolved to find out more
were you at the performance last evening she asked of the next of hurstwoods friends who greeted her as she sat in her box
yes
you didnt get around no she answered i was not feeling very well so your husband told me he answered
well it was really very enjoyable
turned out much better than i expected were there many there the house was full
it was quite an elk night
i saw quite a number of your friendsmrs
harrison mrs barnes mrs collins quite a social gathering indeed it was
my wife enjoyed it very much mrs hurstwood bit her lip
so she thought thats the way he does
tells my friends i am sick and cannot come she wondered what could induce him to go alone
there was something back of this
she rummaged her brain for a reason
by evening when hurstwood reached home she had brooded herself into a state of sullen desire for explanation and revenge
she wanted to know what this peculiar action of his imported
she was certain there was more behind it all than what she had heard and evil curiosity mingled well with distrust and the remnants of her wrath of the morning
she impending disaster itself walked about with gathered shadow at the eyes and the rudimentary muscles of savagery fixing the hard lines of her mouth
on the other hand as we may well believe the manager came home in the sunniest mood
his conversation and agreement with carrie had raised his spirits until he was in the frame of mind of one who sings joyously
he was proud of himself proud of his success proud of carrie
he could have been genial to all the world and he bore no grudge against his wife
he meant to be pleasant to forget her presence to live in the atmosphere of youth and pleasure which had been restored to him
so now the house to his mind had a most pleasing and comfortable appearance
in the hall he found an evening paper laid there by the maid and forgotten by mrs hurstwood
in the diningroom the table was clean laid with linen and napery and shiny with glasses and decorated china
through an open door he saw into the kitchen where the fire was crackling in the stove and the evening meal already well under way
out in the small back yard was george jr frolicking with a young dog he had recently purchased and in the parlour jessica was playing at the piano the sounds of a merry waltz filling every nook and corner of the comfortable home
every one like himself seemed to have regained his good spirits to be in sympathy with youth and beauty to be inclined to joy and merrymaking
he felt as if he could say a good word all around himself and took a most genial glance at the spread table and polished sideboard before going upstairs to read his paper in the comfortable armchair of the sittingroom which looked through the open windows into the street
when he entered there however he found his wife brushing her hair and musing to herself the while
he came lightly in thinking to smooth over any feeling that might still exist by a kindly word and a ready promise but mrs hurstwood said nothing
he seated himself in the large chair stirred lightly in making himself comfortable opened his paper and began to read
in a few moments he was smiling merrily over a very comical account of a baseball game which had taken place between the chicago and detroit teams
the while he was doing this mrs hurstwood was observing him casually through the medium of the mirror which was before her
she noticed his pleasant and contented manner his airy grace and smiling humour and it merely aggravated her the more
she wondered how he could think to carry himself so in her presence after the cynicism indifference and neglect he had heretofore manifested and would continue to manifest so long as she would endure it
she thought how she should like to tell himwhat stress and emphasis she would lend her assertions how she should drive over this whole affair until satisfaction should be rendered her
indeed the shining sword of her wrath was but weakly suspended by a thread of thought
in the meanwhile hurstwood encountered a humorous item concerning a stranger who had arrived in the city and became entangled with a buncosteerer
it amused him immensely and at last he stirred and chuckled to himself
he wished that he might enlist his wifes attention and read it to her
ha ha he exclaimed softly as if to himself thats funny mrs hurstwood kept on arranging her hair not so much as deigning a glance
he stirred again and went on to another subject
at last he felt as if his goodhumour must find some outlet
julia was probably still out of humour over that affair of this morning but that could easily be straightened
as a matter of fact she was in the wrong but he didnt care
she could go to waukesha right away if she wanted to
the sooner the better
he would tell her that as soon as he got a chance and the whole thing would blow over
did you notice he said at last breaking forth concerning another item which he had found that they have entered suit to compel the illinois central to get off the lake front julia he asked
she could scarcely force herself to answer but managed to say no sharply
hurstwood pricked up his ears
there was a note in her voice which vibrated keenly
it would be a good thing if they did he went on half to himself half to her though he felt that something was amiss in that quarter
he withdrew his attention to his paper very circumspectly listening mentally for the little sounds which should show him what was on foot
as a matter of fact no man as clever as hurstwoodas observant and sensitive to atmospheres of many sorts particularly upon his own plane of thoughtwould have made the mistake which he did in regard to his wife wrought up as she was had he not been occupied mentally with a very different train of thought
had not the influence of carries regard for him the elation which her promise aroused in him lasted over he would not have seen the house in so pleasant a mood
it was not extraordinarily bright and merry this evening
he was merely very much mistaken and would have been much more fitted to cope with it had he come home in his normal state
after he had studied his paper a few moments longer he felt that he ought to modify matters in some way or other
evidently his wife was not going to patch up peace at a word
so he said where did george get the dog he has there in the yard i dont know she snapped
he put his paper down on his knees and gazed idly out of the window
he did not propose to lose his temper but merely to be persistent and agreeable and by a few questions bring around a mild understanding of some sort
why do you feel so bad about that affair of this morning he said at last
we neednt quarrel about that
you know you can go to waukesha if you want to so you can stay here and trifle around with some one else she exclaimed turning to him a determined countenance upon which was drawn a sharp and wrathful sneer
he stopped as if slapped in the face
in an instant his persuasive conciliatory manner fled
he was on the defensive at a wink and puzzled for a word to reply
what do you mean he said at last straightening himself and gazing at the cold determined figure before him who paid no attention but went on arranging herself before the mirror
you know what i mean she said finally as if there were a world of information which she held in reservewhich she did not need to tell
well i dont he said stubbornly yet nervous and alert for what should come next
the finality of the womans manner took away his feeling of superiority in battle
she made no answer
hmph he murmured with a movement of his head to one side
it was the weakest thing he had ever done
it was totally unassured
mrs hurstwood noticed the lack of colour in it
she turned upon him animallike able to strike an effectual second blow
i want the waukesha money tomorrow morning she said
he looked at her in amazement
never before had he seen such a cold steely determination in her eyesuch a cruel look of indifference
she seemed a thorough master of her moodthoroughly confident and determined to wrest all control from him
he felt that all his resources could not defend him
he must attack
what do you mean he said jumping up
you want
id like to know whats got into you tonight nothings got into me she said flaming
i want that money
you can do your swaggering afterwards swaggering eh
what
youll get nothing from me
what do you mean by your insinuations anyhow where were you last night she answered
the words were hot as they came
who were you driving with on washington boulevard
who were you with at the theatre when george saw you
do you think im a fool to be duped by you
do you think ill sit at home here and take your too busys and cant come while you parade around and make out that im unable to come
i want you to know that lordly airs have come to an end so far as i am concerned
you cant dictate to me nor my children
im through with you entirely its a lie he said driven to a corner and knowing no other excuse
lie eh she said fiercely but with returning reserve you may call it a lie if you want to but i know its a lie i tell you he said in a low sharp voice
youve been searching around for some cheap accusation for months and now you think you have it
you think youll spring something and get the upper hand
well i tell you you cant
as long as im in this house im master of it and you or any one else wont dictate to medo you hear he crept toward her with a light in his eye that was ominous
something in the womans cool cynical upperhandish manner as if she were already master caused him to feel for the moment as if he could strangle her
she gazed at hima pythoness in humour
im not dictating to you she returned im telling you what i want the answer was so cool so rich in bravado that somehow it took the wind out of his sails
he could not attack her he could not ask her for proofs
somehow he felt evidence law the remembrance of all his property which she held in her name to be shining in her glance
he was like a vessel powerful and dangerous but rolling and floundering without sail
and im telling you he said in the end slightly recovering himself what youll not get well see about it she said
ill find out what my rights are
perhaps youll talk to a lawyer if you wont to me it was a magnificent play and had its effect
hurstwood fell back beaten
he knew now that he had more than mere bluff to contend with
he felt that he was face to face with a dull proposition
what to say he hardly knew
all the merriment had gone out of the day
he was disturbed wretched resentful
what should he do
do as you please he said at last
ill have nothing more to do with you and out he strode
chapter xxiii
a spirit in travail one rung put behind when carrie reached her own room she had already fallen a prey to those doubts and misgivings which are ever the result of a lack of decision
she could not persuade herself as to the advisability of her promise or that now having given her word she ought to keep it
she went over the whole ground in hurstwoods absence and discovered little objections that had not occurred to her in the warmth of the managers argument
she saw where she had put herself in a peculiar light namely that of agreeing to marry when she was already supposedly married
she remembered a few things drouet had done and now that it came to walking away from him without a word she felt as if she were doing wrong
now she was comfortably situated and to one who is more or less afraid of the world this is an urgent matter and one which puts up strange uncanny arguments
you do not know what will come
there are miserable things outside
people go abegging
women are wretched
you never can tell what will happen
remember the time you were hungry
stick to what you have curiously for all her leaning towards hurstwood he had not taken a firm hold on her understanding
she was listening smiling approving and yet not finally agreeing
this was due to a lack of power on his part a lack of that majesty of passion that sweeps the mind from its seat fuses and melts all arguments and theories into a tangled mass and destroys for the time being the reasoning power
this majesty of passion is possessed by nearly every man once in his life but it is usually an attribute of youth and conduces to the first successful mating
hurstwood being an older man could scarcely be said to retain the fire of youth though he did possess a passion warm and unreasoning
it was strong enough to induce the leaning toward him which on carries part we have seen
she might have been said to be imagining herself in love when she was not
women frequently do this
it flows from the fact that in each exists a bias toward affection a craving for the pleasure of being loved
the longing to be shielded bettered sympathised with is one of the attributes of the sex
this coupled with sentiment and a natural tendency to emotion often makes refusing difficult
it persuades them that they are in love
once at home she changed her clothes and straightened the rooms for herself
in the matter of the arrangement of the furniture she never took the housemaids opinion
that young woman invariably put one of the rockingchairs in the corner and carrie as regularly moved it out
today she hardly noticed that it was in the wrong place so absorbed was she in her own thoughts
she worked about the room until drouet put in appearance at five oclock
the drummer was flushed and excited and full of determination to know all about her relations with hurstwood
nevertheless after going over the subject in his mind the livelong day he was rather weary of it and wished it over with
he did not foresee serious consequences of any sort and yet he rather hesitated to begin
carrie was sitting by the window when he came in rocking and looking out
well she said innocently weary of her own mental discussion and wondering at his haste and illconcealed excitement what makes you hurry so drouet hesitated now that he was in her presence uncertain as to what course to pursue
he was no diplomat
he could neither read nor see
when did you get home he asked foolishly
oh an hour or so ago
what makes you ask that you werent here he said when i came back this morning and i thought you had gone out so i did said carrie simply
i went for a walk drouet looked at her wonderingly
for all his lack of dignity in such matters he did not know how to begin
he stared at her in the most flagrant manner until at last she said what makes you stare at me so
whats the matter nothing he answered
i was just thinking just thinking what she returned smilingly puzzled by his attitude
oh nothingnothing much well then what makes you look so drouet was standing by the dresser gazing at her in a comic manner
he had laid off his hat and gloves and was now fidgeting with the little toilet pieces which were nearest him
he hesitated to believe that the pretty woman before him was involved in anything so unsatisfactory to himself
he was very much inclined to feel that it was all right after all
yet the knowledge imparted to him by the chambermaid was rankling in his mind
he wanted to plunge in with a straight remark of some sort but he knew not what
where did you go this morning he finally asked weakly
why i went for a walk said carrie
sure you did he asked
yes what makes you ask she was beginning to see now that he knew something
instantly she drew herself into a more reserved position
her cheeks blanched slightly
i thought maybe you didnt he said beating about the bush in the most useless manner
carrie gazed at him and as she did so her ebbing courage halted
she saw that he himself was hesitating and with a womans intuition realised that there was no occasion for great alarm
what makes you talk like that she asked wrinkling her pretty forehead
you act so funny tonight i feel funny he answered
they looked at one another for a moment and then drouet plunged desperately into his subject
whats this about you and hurstwood he asked
me and hurstwoodwhat do you mean didnt he come here a dozen times while i was away a dozen times repeated carrie guiltily
no but what do you mean somebody said that you went out riding with him and that he came here every night no such thing answered carrie
it isnt true
who told you that she was flushing scarlet to the roots of her hair but drouet did not catch the full hue of her face owing to the modified light of the room
he was regaining much confidence as carrie defended herself with denials
well some one he said
youre sure you didnt certainly said carrie
you know how often he came drouet paused for a moment and thought
i know what you told me he said finally
he moved nervously about while carrie looked at him confusedly
well i know that i didnt tell you any such thing as that said carrie recovering herself
if i were you went on drouet ignoring her last remark i wouldnt have anything to do with him
hes a married man you know whowho is said carrie stumbling at the word
why hurstwood said drouet noting the effect and feeling that he was delivering a telling blow
hurstwood exclaimed carrie rising
her face had changed several shades since this announcement was made
she looked within and without herself in a halfdazed way
who told you this she asked forgetting that her interest was out of order and exceedingly incriminating
why i know it
ive always known it said drouet
carrie was feeling about for a right thought
she was making a most miserable showing and yet feelings were generating within her which were anything but crumbling cowardice
i thought i told you he added
no you didnt she contradicted suddenly recovering her voice
you didnt do anything of the kind drouet listened to her in astonishment
this was something new
i thought i did he said
carrie looked around her very solemnly and then went over to the window
you oughtnt to have had anything to do with him said drouet in an injured tone after all ive done for you you said carrie you
what have you done for me her little brain had been surging with contradictory feelingsshame at exposure shame at hurstwoods perfidy anger at drouets deception the mockery he had made at her
now one clear idea came into her head
he was at fault
there was no doubt about it
why did he bring hurstwood outhurstwood a married man and never say a word to her
never mind now about hurstwoods perfidywhy had he done this
why hadnt he warned her
there he stood now guilty of this miserable breach of confidence and talking about what he had done for her
well i like that exclaimed drouet little realising the fire his remark had generated
i think ive done a good deal you have eh she answered
youve deceived methats what youve done
youve brought your old friends out here under false pretences
youve made me out to beoh and with this her voice broke and she pressed her two little hands together tragically
i dont see what thats got to do with it said the drummer quaintly
no she answered recovering herself and shutting her teeth
no of course you dont see
there isnt anything you see
you couldnt have told me in the first place could you
you had to make me out wrong until it was too late
now you come sneaking around with your information and your talk about what you have done drouet had never suspected this side of carries nature
she was alive with feeling her eyes snapping her lips quivering her whole body sensible of the injury she felt and partaking of her wrath
whos sneaking he asked mildly conscious of error on his part but certain that he was wronged
you are stamped carrie
youre a horrid conceited coward thats what you are
if you had any sense of manhood in you you wouldnt have thought of doing any such thing the drummer stared
im not a coward he said
what do you mean by going with other men anyway other men exclaimed carrie
other menyou know better than that
i did go with mr hurstwood but whose fault was it
didnt you bring him here
you told him yourself that he should come out here and take me out
now after its all over you come and tell me that i oughtnt to go with him and that hes a married man she paused at the sound of the last two words and wrung her hands
the knowledge of hurstwoods perfidy wounded her like a knife
oh she sobbed repressing herself wonderfully and keeping her eyes dry
oh oh well i didnt think youd be running around with him when i was away insisted drouet
didnt think said carrie now angered to the core by the mans peculiar attitude
of course not
you thought only of what would be to your satisfaction
you thought youd make a toy of mea plaything
well ill show you that you wont
ill have nothing more to do with you at all
you can take your old things and keep them and unfastening a little pin he had given her she flung it vigorously upon the floor and began to move about as if to gather up the things which belonged to her
by this drouet was not only irritated but fascinated the more
he looked at her in amazement and finally said i dont see where your wrath comes in
ive got the right of this thing
you oughtnt to have done anything that wasnt right after all i did for you what have you done for me asked carrie blazing her head thrown back and her lips parted
i think ive done a good deal said the drummer looking around
ive given you all the clothes you wanted havent i
ive taken you everywhere you wanted to go
youve had as much as ive had and more too carrie was not ungrateful whatever else might be said of her
in so far as her mind could construe she acknowledged benefits received
she hardly knew how to answer this and yet her wrath was not placated
she felt that the drummer had injured her irreparably
did i ask you to she returned
well i did it said drouet and you took it you talk as though i had persuaded you answered carrie
you stand there and throw up what youve done
i dont want your old things
ill not have them
you take them tonight and do what you please with them
ill not stay here another minute thats nice he answered becoming angered now at the sense of his own approaching loss
use everything and abuse me and then walk off
thats just like a woman
i take you when you havent got anything and then when some one else comes along why im no good
i always thought itd come out that way he felt really hurt as he thought of his treatment and looked as if he saw no way of obtaining justice
its not so said carrie and im not going with anybody else
you have been as miserable and inconsiderate as you can be
i hate you i tell you and i wouldnt live with you another minute
youre a big insultinghere she hesitated and used no word at allor you wouldnt talk that way she had secured her hat and jacket and slipped the latter on over her little evening dress
some wisps of wavy hair had loosened from the bands at the side of her head and were straggling over her hot red cheeks
she was angry mortified griefstricken
her large eyes were full of the anguish of tears but her lids were not yet wet
she was distracted and uncertain deciding and doing things without an aim or conclusion and she had not the slightest conception of how the whole difficulty would end
well thats a fine finish said drouet
pack up and pull out eh
you take the cake
i bet you were knocking around with hurstwood or you wouldnt act like that
i dont want the old rooms
you neednt pull out for me
you can have them for all i care but bgeorge you havent done me right ill not live with you said carrie
i dont want to live with you
youve done nothing but brag around ever since youve been here aw i havent anything of the kind he answered
carrie walked over to the door
where are you going he said stepping over and heading her off
let me out she said
where are you going he repeated
he was above all sympathetic and the sight of carrie wandering out he knew not where affected him despite his grievance
carrie merely pulled at the door
the strain of the situation was too much for her however
she made one more vain effort and then burst into tears
now be reasonable cad said drouet gently
what do you want to rush out for this way
you havent any place to go
why not stay here now and be quiet
ill not bother you
i dont want to stay here any longer carrie had gone sobbing from the door to the window
she was so overcome she could not speak
be reasonable now he said
i dont want to hold you
you can go if you want to but why dont you think it over
lord knows i dont want to stop you he received no answer
carrie was quieting however under the influence of his plea
you stay here now and ill go he added at last
carrie listened to this with mingled feelings
her mind was shaken loose from the little mooring of logic that it had
she was stirred by this thought angered by thather own injustice hurstwoods drouets their respective qualities of kindness and favour the threat of the world outside in which she had failed once before the impossibility of this state inside where the chambers were no longer justly hers the effect of the argument upon her nerves all combined to make her a mass of jangling fibresan anchorless stormbeaten little craft which could do absolutely nothing but drift
say said drouet coming over to her after a few moments with a new idea and putting his hand upon her
dont said carrie drawing away but not removing her handkerchief from her eyes
never mind about this quarrel now
let it go
you stay here until the months out anyhow and then you can tell better what you want to do
eh carrie made no answer
youd better do that he said
theres no use your packing up now
you cant go anywhere still he got nothing for his words
if youll do that well call it off for the present and ill get out carrie lowered her handkerchief slightly and looked out of the window
will you do that he asked
still no answer
will you he repeated
she only looked vaguely into the street
aw
come on he said tell me
will you i dont know said carrie softly forced to answer
promise me youll do that he said and well quit talking about it
itll be the best thing for you carrie heard him but she could not bring herself to answer reasonably
she felt that the man was gentle and that his interest in her had not abated and it made her suffer a pang of regret
she was in a most helpless plight
as for drouet his attitude had been that of the jealous lover
now his feelings were a mixture of anger at deception sorrow at losing carrie misery at being defeated
he wanted his rights in some way or other and yet his rights included the retaining of carrie the making her feel her error
will you he urged
well ill see said carrie
this left the matter as open as before but it was something
it looked as if the quarrel would blow over if they could only get some way of talking to one another
carrie was ashamed and drouet aggrieved
he pretended to take up the task of packing some things in a valise
now as carrie watched him out of the corner of her eye certain sound thoughts came into her head
he had erred true but what had she done
he was kindly and goodnatured for all his egotism
throughout this argument he had said nothing very harsh
on the other hand there was hurstwooda greater deceiver than he
he had pretended all this affection all this passion and he was lying to her all the while
oh the perfidy of men
and she had loved him
there could be nothing more in that quarter
she would see hurstwood no more
she would write him and let him know what she thought
thereupon what would she do
here were these rooms
here was drouet pleading for her to remain
evidently things could go on here somewhat as before if all were arranged
it would be better than the street without a place to lay her head
all this she thought of as drouet rummaged the drawers for collars and laboured long and painstakingly at finding a shirtstud
he was in no hurry to rush this matter
he felt an attraction to carrie which would not down
he could not think that the thing would end by his walking out of the room
there must be some way round some way to make her own up that he was right and she was wrongto patch up a peace and shut out hurstwood for ever
mercy how he turned at the mans shameless duplicity
do you think he said after a few moments silence that youll try and get on the stage he was wondering what she was intending
i dont know what ill do yet said carrie
if you do maybe i can help you
ive got a lot of friends in that line she made no answer to this
dont go and try to knock around now without any money
let me help you he said
its no easy thing to go on your own hook here carrie only rocked back and forth in her chair
i dont want you to go up against a hard game that way he bestirred himself about some other details and carrie rocked on
why dont you tell me all about this thing he said after a time and lets call it off
you dont really care for hurstwood do you why do you want to start on that again said carrie
you were to blame no i wasnt he answered
yes you were too said carrie
you shouldnt have ever told me such a story as that but you didnt have much to do with him did you went on drouet anxious for his own peace of mind to get some direct denial from her
i wont talk about it said carrie pained at the quizzical turn the peace arrangement had taken
whats the use of acting like that now cad insisted the drummer stopping in his work and putting up a hand expressively
you might let me know where i stand at least i wont said carrie feeling no refuge but in anger
whatever has happened is your own fault then you do care for him said drouet stopping completely and experiencing a rush of feeling
oh stop said carrie
well ill not be made a fool of exclaimed drouet
you may trifle around with him if you want to but you cant lead me
you can tell me or not just as you want to but i wont fool any longer he shoved the last few remaining things he had laid out into his valise and snapped it with a vengeance
then he grabbed his coat which he had laid off to work picked up his gloves and started out
you can go to the deuce as far as i am concerned he said as he reached the door
im no sucker and with that he opened it with a jerk and closed it equally vigorously
carrie listened at her window view more astonished than anything else at this sudden rise of passion in the drummer
she could hardly believe her sensesso goodnatured and tractable had he invariably been
it was not for her to see the wellspring of human passion
a real flame of love is a subtle thing
it burns as a willothewisp dancing onward to fairylands of delight
it roars as a furnace
too often jealousy is the quality upon which it feeds
chapter xxiv
ashes of tinder a face at the window that night hurstwood remained down town entirely going to the palmer house for a bed after his work was through
he was in a fevered state of mind owing to the blight his wifes action threatened to cast upon his entire future
while he was not sure how much significance might be attached to the threat she had made he was sure that her attitude if long continued would cause him no end of trouble
she was determined and had worsted him in a very important contest
how would it be from now on
he walked the floor of his little office and later that of his room putting one thing and another together to no avail
mrs hurstwood on the contrary had decided not to lose her advantage by inaction
now that she had practically cowed him she would follow up her work with demands the acknowledgment of which would make her word law in the future
he would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble
it did not matter what he did
she really did not care whether he came home any more or not
the household would move along much more pleasantly without him and she could do as she wished without consulting any one
now she proposed to consult a lawyer and hire a detective
she would find out at once just what advantages she could gain
hurstwood walked the floor mentally arranging the chief points of his situation
she has that property in her name he kept saying to himself
what a fool trick that was
curse it
what a fool move that was he also thought of his managerial position
if she raises a row now ill lose this thing
they wont have me around if my name gets in the papers
my friends too he grew more angry as he thought of the talk any action on her part would create
how would the papers talk about it
every man he knew would be wondering
he would have to explain and deny and make a general mark of himself
then moy would come and confer with him and there would be the devil to pay
many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brow moistened
he saw no solution of anythingnot a loophole left
through all this thoughts of carrie flashed upon him and the approaching affair of saturday
tangled as all his matters were he did not worry over that
it was the one pleasing thing in this whole rout of trouble
he could arrange that satisfactorily for carrie would be glad to wait if necessary
he would see how things turned out tomorrow and then he would talk to her
they were going to meet as usual
he saw only her pretty face and neat figure and wondered why life was not arranged so that such joy as he found with her could be steadily maintained
how much more pleasant it would be
then he would take up his wifes threat again and the wrinkles and moisture would return
in the morning he came over from the hotel and opened his mail but there was nothing in it outside the ordinary run
for some reason he felt as if something might come that way and was relieved when all the envelopes had been scanned and nothing suspicious noticed
he began to feel the appetite that had been wanting before he had reached the office and decided before going out to the park to meet carrie to drop in at the grand pacific and have a pot of coffee and some rolls
while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialised and with him no news was good news
if he could only get plenty of time to think perhaps something would turn up
surely surely this thing would not drift along to catastrophe and he not find a way out
his spirits fell however when upon reaching the park he waited and waited and carrie did not come
he held his favourite post for an hour or more then arose and began to walk about restlessly
could something have happened out there to keep her away
could she have been reached by his wife
surely not
so little did he consider drouet that it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out
he grew restless as he ruminated and then decided that perhaps it was nothing
she had not been able to get away this morning
that was why no letter notifying him had come
he would get one today
it would probably be on his desk when he got back
he would look for it at once
after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the madison car
to add to his distress the bright blue sky became overcast with little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun
the wind veered to the east and by the time he reached his office it was threatening to drizzle all afternoon
he went in and examined his letters but there was nothing from carrie
fortunately there was nothing from his wife either
he thanked his stars that he did not have to confront that proposition just now when he needed to think so much
he walked the floor again pretending to be in an ordinary mood but secretly troubled beyond the expression of words
at onethirty he went to rectors for lunch and when he returned a messenger was waiting for him
he looked at the little chap with a feeling of doubt
im to bring an answer said the boy
hurstwood recognised his wifes writing
he tore it open and read without a show of feeling
it began in the most formal manner and was sharply and coldly worded throughout
i want you to send the money i asked for at once
i need it to carry out my plans
you can stay away if you want to
it doesnt matter in the least
but i must have some money
so dont delay but send it by the boy when he had finished it he stood holding it in his hands
the audacity of the thing took his breath
it roused his ire alsothe deepest element of revolt in him
his first impulse was to write but four words in replygo to the devilbut he compromised by telling the boy that there would be no reply
then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
what would she do about that
the confounded wretch
was she going to try to bulldoze him into submission
he would go up there and have it out with her thats what he would do
she was carrying things with too high a hand
these were his first thoughts
later however his old discretion asserted itself
something had to be done
a climax was near and she would not sit idle
he knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up
possibly matters would go into a lawyers hands at once
damn her he said softly with his teeth firmly set ill make it hot for her if she causes me trouble
ill make her change her tone if i have to use force to do it he arose from his chair and went and looked out into the street
the long drizzle had begun
pedestrians had turned up collars and trousers at the bottom
hands were hidden in the pockets of the umbrellaless umbrellas were up
the street looked like a sea of round black cloth roofs twisting bobbing moving
trucks and vans were rattling in a noisy line and everywhere men were shielding themselves as best they could
he scarcely noticed the picture
he was forever confronting his wife demanding of her to change her attitude toward him before he worked her bodily harm
at four oclock another note came which simply said that if the money was not forthcoming that evening the matter would be laid before fitzgerald and moy on the morrow and other steps would be taken to get it
hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistency of this thing
yes he would send her the money
hed take it to herhe would go up there and have a talk with her and that at once
he put on his hat and looked around for his umbrella
he would have some arrangement of this thing
he called a cab and was driven through the dreary rain to the north side
on the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the case
what did she know
what had she done
maybe shed got hold of carrie who knowsoror drouet
perhaps she really had evidence and was prepared to fell him as a man does another from secret ambush
she was shrewd
why should she taunt him this way unless she had good grounds
he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or otherthat he had sent the money
perhaps he could do it up here
he would go in and see anyhow
he would have no row
by the time he reached his own street he was keenly alive to the difficulties of his situation and wished over and over that some solution would offer itself that he could see his way out
he alighted and went up the steps to the front door but it was with a nervous palpitation of the heart
he pulled out his key and tried to insert it but another key was on the inside
he shook at the knob but the door was locked
then he rang the bell
no answer
he rang againthis time harder
still no answer
he jangled it fiercely several times in succession but without avail
then he went below
there was a door which opened under the steps into the kitchen protected by an iron grating intended as a safeguard against burglars
when he reached this he noticed that it also was bolted and that the kitchen windows were down
what could it mean
he rang the bell and then waited
finally seeing that no one was coming he turned and went back to his cab
i guess theyve gone out he said apologetically to the individual who was hiding his red face in a loose tarpaulin raincoat
i saw a young girl up in that winder returned the cabby
hurstwood looked but there was no face there now
he climbed moodily into the cab relieved and distressed
so this was the game was it
shut him out and make him pay
well by the lord that did beat all
chapter xxv
ashes of tinder the loosing of stays when hurstwood got back to his office again he was in a greater quandary than ever
lord lord he thought what had he got into
how could things have taken such a violent turn and so quickly
he could hardly realise how it had all come about
it seemed a monstrous unnatural unwarranted condition which had suddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance
meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to carrie
what could be the trouble in that quarter
no letter had come no word of any kind and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning
tomorrow they were to have met and gone offwhere
he saw that in the excitement of recent events he had not formulated a plan upon that score
he was desperately in love and would have taken great chances to win her under ordinary circumstances but nownow what
supposing she had found out something
supposing she too wrote him and told him that she knew allthat she would have nothing more to do with him
it would be just like this to happen as things were going now
meanwhile he had not sent the money
he strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort his hands in his pockets his brow wrinkled his mouth set
he was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him
every once in a while he would clinch his fingers and tap his footsigns of the stirring mental process he was undergoing
his whole nature was vigorously and powerfully shaken up and he was finding what limits the mind has to endurance
he drank more brandy and soda than he had any evening in months
he was altogether a fine example of great mental perturbation
for all his study nothing came of the evening except thishe sent the money
it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got an envelope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
then he called harry the boy of all work around the place
you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to mrs hurstwood yes sir said the boy
if she isnt there bring it back yes sir youve seen my wife he asked as a precautionary measure as the boy turned to go
oh yes sir
i know her all right now
hurry right back any answer i guess not the boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings
now he had done it
there was no use speculating over that
he was beaten for tonight and he might just as well make the best of it
but oh the wretchedness of being forced this way
he could see her meeting the boy at the door and smiling sardonically
she would take the envelope and know that she had triumphed
if he only had that letter back he wouldnt send it
he breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his face
for relief he arose and joined in conversation with a few friends who were drinking
he tried to get the interest of things about him but it was not to be
all the time his thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being therein enacted
all the time he was wondering what she would say when the boy handed her the envelope
in about an hour and threequarters the boy returned
he had evidently delivered the package for as he came up he made no sign of taking anything out of his pocket
well said hurstwood
i gave it to her my wife yes sir any answer she said it was high time hurstwood scowled fiercely
there was no more to be done upon that score that night
he went on brooding over his situation until midnight when he repaired again to the palmer house
he wondered what the morning would bring forth and slept anything but soundly upon it
next day he went again to the office and opened his mail suspicious and hopeful of its contents
no word from carrie
nothing from his wife which was pleasant
the fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked to the ease of his mind for as the thought that he had done it receded his chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more
he fancied as he sat at his desk that nothing would be done for a week or two
meanwhile he would have time to think
this process of thinking began by a reversion to carrie and the arrangement by which he was to get her away from drouet
how about that now
his pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to this subject
he decided to write her care of the west side postoffice and ask for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
the thought that this letter would probably not reach her until monday chafed him exceedingly
he must get some speedier methodbut how
he thought upon it for a halfhour not contemplating a messenger or a cab direct to the house owing to the exposure of it but finding that time was slipping away to no purpose he wrote the letter and then began to think again
the hours slipped by and with them the possibility of the union he had contemplated
he had thought to be joyously aiding carrie by now in the task of joining her interests to his and here it was afternoon and nothing done
three oclock came four five six and no letter
the helpless manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat
he saw a busy saturday ushered out the sabbath in and nothing done
all day the bar being closed he brooded alone shut out from home from the excitement of his resort from carrie and without the ability to alter his condition one iota
it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
in mondays second mail he encountered a very legallooking letter which held his interest for some time
it bore the imprint of the law offices of mcgregor james and hay and with a very formal dear sir and we beg to state went on to inform him briefly that they had been retained by mrs julia hurstwood to adjust certain matters which related to her sustenance and property rights and would he kindly call and see them about the matter at once
he read it through carefully several times and then merely shook his head
it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning
well he said after a time quite audibly i dont know then he folded it up and put it in his pocket
to add to his misery there was no word from carrie
he was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy
his loss seemed all the more bitter now that he needed her most
he thought he would go out and insist on seeing her if she did not send him word of some sort soon
he was really affected most miserably of all by this desertion
he had loved her earnestly enough but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive
he really pined for a word and looked out upon her with his minds eye in the most wistful manner
he did not propose to lose her whatever she might think
come what might he would adjust this matter and soon
he would go to her and tell her all his family complications
he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her
surely she couldnt go back on him now
it wasnt possible
he would plead until her anger would meltuntil she would forgive him
suddenly he thought supposing she isnt out theresuppose she has gone he was forced to take his feet
it was too much to think of and sit still
nevertheless his rousing availed him nothing
on tuesday it was the same way
he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carrie but when he got in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
he did not go within a block of the house
one of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a randolph street car and without noticing arrived almost opposite the building of the concern with which his son was connected
this sent a pang through his heart
he had called on his boy there several times
now the lad had not sent him a word
his absence did not seem to be noticed by either of his children
well well fortune plays a man queer tricks
he got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends
it was as if idle chatter deadened the sense of misery
that night he dined at rectors and returned at once to his office
in the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief
he troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody
he stayed at his desk long after all others had gone and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked
on wednesday he received another polite note from mcgregor james and hay
it read dear sir we beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until tomorrow thursday at one oclock before filing suit against you on behalf of mrs julia hurstwood for divorce and alimony
if we do not hear from you before that time we shall consider that you do not wish to compromise the matter in any way and act accordingly
very truly yours etc compromise exclaimed hurstwood bitterly
compromise again he shook his head
so here it was spread out clear before him and now he knew what to expect
if he didnt go and see them they would sue him promptly
if he did he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil
he folded the letter and put it with the other one
then he put on his hat and went for a turn about the block
chapter xxvi
the ambassador fallen a search for the gate carrie left alone by drouet listened to his retreating steps scarcely realising what had happened
she knew that he had stormed out
it was some moments before she questioned whether he would return not now exactly but ever
she looked around her upon the rooms out of which the evening light was dying and wondered why she did not feel quite the same towards them
she went over to the dresser and struck a match lighting the gas
then she went back to the rocker to think
it was some time before she could collect her thoughts but when she did this truth began to take on importance
she was quite alone
suppose drouet did not come back
suppose she should never hear anything more of him
this fine arrangement of chambers would not last long
she would have to quit them
to her credit be it said she never once counted on hurstwood
she could only approach that subject with a pang of sorrow and regret
for a truth she was rather shocked and frightened by this evidence of human depravity
he would have tricked her without turning an eyelash
she would have been led into a newer and worse situation
and yet she could not keep out the pictures of his looks and manners
only this one deed seemed strange and miserable
it contrasted sharply with all she felt and knew concerning the man
but she was alone
that was the greater thought just at present
how about that
would she go out to work again
would she begin to look around in the business district
the stage
oh yes
drouet had spoken about that
was there any hope there
she moved to and fro in deep and varied thoughts while the minutes slipped away and night fell completely
she had had nothing to eat and yet there she sat thinking it over
she remembered that she was hungry and went to the little cupboard in the rear room where were the remains of one of their breakfasts
she looked at these things with certain misgivings
the contemplation of food had more significance than usual
while she was eating she began to wonder how much money she had
it struck her as exceedingly important and without ado she went to look for her purse
it was on the dresser and in it were seven dollars in bills and some change
she quailed as she thought of the insignificance of the amount and rejoiced because the rent was paid until the end of the month
she began also to think what she would have done if she had gone out into the street when she first started
by the side of that situation as she looked at it now the present seemed agreeable
she had a little time at least and then perhaps everything would come out all right after all
drouet had gone but what of it
he did not seem seriously angry
he only acted as if he were huffy
he would come backof course he would
there was his cane in the corner
here was one of his collars
he had left his light overcoat in the wardrobe
she looked about and tried to assure herself with the sight of a dozen such details but alas the secondary thought arrived
supposing he did come back
then what
here was another proposition nearly if not quite as disturbing
she would have to talk with and explain to him
he would want her to admit that he was right
it would be impossible for her to live with him
on friday carrie remembered her appointment with hurstwood and the passing of the hour when she should by all right of promise have been in his company served to keep the calamity which had befallen her exceedingly fresh and clear
in her nervousness and stress of mind she felt it necessary to act and consequently put on a brown street dress and at eleven oclock started to visit the business portion once again
she must look for work
the rain which threatened at twelve and began at one served equally well to cause her to retrace her steps and remain within doors as it did to reduce hurstwoods spirits and give him a wretched day
the morrow was saturday a halfholiday in many business quarters and besides it was a balmy radiant day with the trees and grass shining exceedingly green after the rain of the night before
when she went out the sparrows were twittering merrily in joyous choruses
she could not help feeling as she looked across the lovely park that life was a joyous thing for those who did not need to worry and she wished over and over that something might interfere now to preserve for her the comfortable state which she had occupied
she did not want drouet or his money when she thought of it nor anything more to do with hurstwood but only the content and ease of mind she had experienced for after all she had been happyhappier at least than she was now when confronted by the necessity of making her way alone
when she arrived in the business part it was quite eleven oclock and the business had little longer to run
she did not realise this at first being affected by some of the old distress which was a result of her earlier adventure into this strenuous and exacting quarter
she wandered about assuring herself that she was making up her mind to look for something and at the same time feeling that perhaps it was not necessary to be in such haste about it
the thing was difficult to encounter and she had a few days
besides she was not sure that she was really face to face again with the bitter problem of selfsustenance
anyhow there was one change for the better
she knew that she had improved in appearance
her manner had vastly changed
her clothes were becoming and menwelldressed men some of the kind who before had gazed at her indifferently from behind their polished railings and imposing office partitionsnow gazed into her face with a soft light in their eyes
in a way she felt the power and satisfaction of the thing but it did not wholly reassure her
she looked for nothing save what might come legitimately and without the appearance of special favour
she wanted something but no man should buy her by false protestations or favour
she proposed to earn her living honestly
this store closes at one on saturdays was a pleasing and satisfactory legend to see upon doors which she felt she ought to enter and inquire for work
it gave her an excuse and after encountering quite a number of them and noting that the clock registered she decided that it would be no use to seek further today so she got on a car and went to lincoln park
there was always something to see therethe flowers the animals the lakeand she flattered herself that on monday she would be up betimes and searching
besides many things might happen between now and monday
sunday passed with equal doubts worries assurances and heaven knows what vagaries of mind and spirit
every halfhour in the day the thought would come to her most sharply like the tail of a swishing whip that actionimmediate actionwas imperative
at other times she would look about her and assure herself that things were not so badthat certainly she would come out safe and sound
at such times she would think of drouets advice about going on the stage and saw some chance for herself in that quarter
she decided to take up that opportunity on the morrow
accordingly she arose early monday morning and dressed herself carefully
she did not know just how such applications were made but she took it to be a matter which related more directly to the theatre buildings
all you had to do was to inquire of some one about the theatre for the manager and ask for a position
if there was anything you might get it or at least he could tell you how
she had had no experience with this class of individuals whatsoever and did not know the salacity and humour of the theatrical tribe
she only knew of the position which mr hale occupied but of all things she did not wish to encounter that personage on account of her intimacy with his wife
there was however at this time one theatre the chicago opera house which was considerably in the public eye and its manager david a henderson had a fair local reputation
carrie had seen one or two elaborate performances there and had heard of several others
she knew nothing of henderson nor of the methods of applying but she instinctively felt that this would be a likely place and accordingly strolled about in that neighbourhood
she came bravely enough to the showy entrance way with the polished and begilded lobby set with framed pictures out of the current attraction leading up to the quiet boxoffice but she could get no further
a noted comic opera comedian was holding forth that week and the air of distinction and prosperity overawed her
she could not imagine that there would be anything in such a lofty sphere for her
she almost trembled at the audacity which might have carried her on to a terrible rebuff
she could find heart only to look at the pictures which were showy and then walk out
it seemed to her as if she had made a splendid escape and that it would be foolhardy to think of applying in that quarter again
this little experience settled her hunting for one day
she looked around elsewhere but it was from the outside
she got the location of several playhouses fixed in her mindnotably the grand opera house and mcvickars both of which were leading in attractionsand then came away
her spirits were materially reduced owing to the newly restored sense of magnitude of the great interests and the insignificance of her claims upon society such as she understood them to be
that night she was visited by mrs hale whose chatter and protracted stay made it impossible to dwell upon her predicament or the fortune of the day
before retiring however she sat down to think and gave herself up to the most gloomy forebodings
drouet had not put in an appearance
she had had no word from any quarter she had spent a dollar of her precious sum in procuring food and paying car fare
it was evident that she would not endure long
besides she had discovered no resource
in this situation her thoughts went out to her sister in van buren street whom she had not seen since the night of her flight and to her home at columbia city which seemed now a part of something that could not be again
she looked for no refuge in that direction
nothing but sorrow was brought her by thoughts of hurstwood which would return
that he could have chosen to dupe her in so ready a manner seemed a cruel thing
tuesday came and with it appropriate indecision and speculation
she was in no mood after her failure of the day before to hasten forth upon her workseeking errand and yet she rebuked herself for what she considered her weakness the day before
accordingly she started out to revisit the chicago opera house but possessed scarcely enough courage to approach
she did manage to inquire at the boxoffice however
manager of the company or the house asked the smartly dressed individual who took care of the tickets
he was favourably impressed by carries looks
i dont know said carrie taken back by the question
you couldnt see the manager of the house today anyhow volunteered the young man
hes out of town he noted her puzzled look and then added what is it you wish to see about i want to see about getting a position she answered
youd better see the manager of the company he returned but he isnt here now when will he be in asked carrie somewhat relieved by this information
well you might find him in between eleven and twelve
hes here after two oclock carrie thanked him and walked briskly out while the young man gazed after her through one of the side windows of his gilded coop
goodlooking he said to himself and proceeded to visions of condescensions on her part which were exceedingly flattering to himself
one of the principal comedy companies of the day was playing an engagement at the grand opera house
here carrie asked to see the manager of the company
she little knew the trivial authority of this individual or that had there been a vacancy an actor would have been sent on from new york to fill it
his office is upstairs said a man in the boxoffice
several persons were in the managers office two lounging near a window another talking to an individual sitting at a rolltop deskthe manager
carrie glanced nervously about and began to fear that she should have to make her appeal before the assembled company two of whomthe occupants of the windowwere already observing her carefully
i cant do it the manager was saying its a rule of mr frohmans never to allow visitors back of the stage
no no carrie timidly waited standing
there were chairs but no one motioned her to be seated
the individual to whom the manager had been talking went away quite crestfallen
that luminary gazed earnestly at some papers before him as if they were of the greatest concern
did you see that in the herald this morning about nat goodwin harris no said the person addressed
what was it made quite a curtain address at hooleys last night
better look it up harris reached over to a table and began to look for the herald what is it said the manager to carrie apparently noticing her for the first time
he thought he was going to be held up for free tickets
carrie summoned up all her courage which was little at best
she realised that she was a novice and felt as if a rebuff were certain
of this she was so sure that she only wished now to pretend she had called for advice
can you tell me how to go about getting on the stage it was the best way after all to have gone about the matter
she was interesting in a manner to the occupant of the chair and the simplicity of her request and attitude took his fancy
he smiled as did the others in the room who however made some slight effort to conceal their humour
i dont know he answered looking her brazenly over
have you ever had any experience upon the stage a little answered carrie
i have taken part in amateur performances she thought she had to make some sort of showing in order to retain his interest
never studied for the stage he said putting on an air intended as much to impress his friends with his discretion as carrie
no sir well i dont know he answered tipping lazily back in his chair while she stood before him
what makes you want to get on the stage she felt abashed at the mans daring but could only smile in answer to his engaging smirk and say i need to make a living oh he answered rather taken by her trim appearance and feeling as if he might scrape up an acquaintance with her
thats a good reason isnt it
well chicago is not a good place for what you want to do
you ought to be in new york
theres more chance there
you could hardly expect to get started out here carrie smiled genially grateful that he should condescend to advise her even so much
he noticed the smile and put a slightly different construction on it
he thought he saw an easy chance for a little flirtation
sit down he said pulling a chair forward from the side of his desk and dropping his voice so that the two men in the room should not hear
those two gave each other the suggestion of a wink
well ill be going barney said one breaking away and so addressing the manager
see you this afternoon all right said the manager
the remaining individual took up a paper as if to read
did you have any idea what sort of part you would like to get asked the manager softly
oh no said carrie
i would take anything to begin with i see he said
do you live here in the city yes sir the manager smiled most blandly
have you ever tried to get in as a chorus girl he asked assuming a more confidential air
carrie began to feel that there was something exuberant and unnatural in his manner
no she said
thats the way most girls begin he went on who go on the stage
its a good way to get experience he was turning on her a glance of the companionable and persuasive manner
i didnt know that said carrie
its a difficult thing he went on but theres always a chance you know then as if he suddenly remembered he pulled out his watch and consulted it
ive an appointment at two he said and ive got to go to lunch now
would you care to come and dine with me
we can talk it over there oh no said carrie the whole motive of the man flashing on her at once
i have an engagement myself thats too bad he said realising that he had been a little beforehand in his offer and that carrie was about to go away
come in later
i may know of something thank you she answered with some trepidation and went out
she was goodlooking wasnt she said the managers companion who had not caught all the details of the game he had played
yes in a way said the other sore to think the game had been lost
shed never make an actress though
just another chorus girlthats all this little experience nearly destroyed her ambition to call upon the manager at the chicago opera house but she decided to do so after a time
he was of a more sedate turn of mind
he said at once that there was no opening of any sort and seemed to consider her search foolish
chicago is no place to get a start he said
you ought to be in new york still she persisted and went to mcvickars where she could not find any one
the old homestead was running there but the person to whom she was referred was not to be found
these little expeditions took up her time until quite four oclock when she was weary enough to go home
she felt as if she ought to continue and inquire elsewhere but the results so far were too dispiriting
she took the car and arrived at ogden place in threequarters of an hour but decided to ride on to the west side branch of the postoffice where she was accustomed to receive hurstwoods letters
there was one there now written saturday which she tore open and read with mingled feelings
there was so much warmth in it and such tense complaint at her having failed to meet him and her subsequent silence that she rather pitied the man
that he loved her was evident enough
that he had wished and dared to do so married as he was was the evil
she felt as if the thing deserved an answer and consequently decided that she would write and let him know that she knew of his married state and was justly incensed at his deception
she would tell him that it was all over between them
at her room the wording of this missive occupied her for some time for she fell to the task at once
it was most difficult
you do not need to have me explain why i did not meet you she wrote in part
how could you deceive me so
you cannot expect me to have anything more to do with you
i wouldnt under any circumstances
oh how could you act so she added in a burst of feeling
you have caused me more misery than you can think
i hope you will get over your infatuation for me
we must not meet any more
goodbye she took the letter the next morning and at the corner dropped it reluctantly into the letterbox still uncertain as to whether she should do so or not
then she took the car and went down town
this was the dull season with the department stores but she was listened to with more consideration than was usually accorded to young women applicants owing to her neat and attractive appearance
she was asked the same old questions with which she was already familiar
what can you do
have you ever worked in a retail store before
are you experienced at the fair see and companys and all the great stores it was much the same
it was the dull season she might come in a little later possibly they would like to have her
when she arrived at the house at the end of the day weary and disheartened she discovered that drouet had been there
his umbrella and light overcoat were gone
she thought she missed other things but could not be sure
everything had not been taken
so his going was crystallising into staying
what was she to do now
evidently she would be facing the world in the same old way within a day or two
her clothes would get poor
she put her two hands together in her customary expressive way and pressed her fingers
large tears gathered in her eyes and broke hot across her cheeks
she was alone very much alone
drouet really had called but it was with a very different mind from that which carrie had imagined
he expected to find her to justify his return by claiming that he came to get the remaining portion of his wardrobe and before he got away again to patch up a peace
accordingly when he arrived he was disappointed to find carrie out
he trifled about hoping that she was somewhere in the neighbourhood and would soon return
he constantly listened expecting to hear her foot on the stair
when he did so it was his intention to make believe that he had just come in and was disturbed at being caught
then he would explain his need of his clothes and find out how things stood
wait as he did however carrie did not come
from pottering around among the drawers in momentary expectation of her arrival he changed to looking out of the window and from that to resting himself in the rockingchair
still no carrie
he began to grow restless and lit a cigar
after that he walked the floor
then he looked out of the window and saw clouds gathering
he remembered an appointment at three
he began to think that it would be useless to wait and got hold of his umbrella and light coat intending to take these things any way
it would scare her he hoped
tomorrow he would come back for the others
he would find out how things stood
as he started to go he felt truly sorry that he had missed her
there was a little picture of her on the wall showing her arrayed in the little jacket he had first bought herher face a little more wistful than he had seen it lately
he was really touched by it and looked into the eyes of it with a rather rare feeling for him
you didnt do me right cad he said as if he were addressing her in the flesh
then he went to the door took a good look around and went out
chapter xxvii
when waters engulf us we reach for a star it was when he returned from his disturbed stroll about the streets after receiving the decisive note from mcgregor james and hay that hurstwood found the letter carrie had written him that morning
he thrilled intensely as he noted the handwriting and rapidly tore it open
then he thought she loves me or she would not have written to me at all he was slightly depressed at the tenor of the note for the first few minutes but soon recovered
she wouldnt write at all if she didnt care for me this was his one resource against the depression which held him
he could extract little from the wording of the letter but the spirit he thought he knew
there was really something exceedingly humanif not patheticin his being thus relieved by a clearly worded reproof
he who had for so long remained satisfied with himself now looked outside of himself for comfortand to such a source
the mystic cords of affection
how they bind us all
the colour came to his cheeks
for the moment he forgot the letter from mcgregor james and hay
if he could only have carrie perhaps he could get out of the whole entanglementperhaps it would not matter
he wouldnt care what his wife did with herself if only he might not lose carrie
he stood up and walked about dreaming his delightful dream of a life continued with this lovely possessor of his heart
it was not long however before the old worry was back for consideration and with it what weariness
he thought of the morrow and the suit
he had done nothing and here was the afternoon slipping away
it was now a quarter of four
at five the attorneys would have gone home
he still had the morrow until noon
even as he thought the last fifteen minutes passed away and it was five
then he abandoned the thought of seeing them any more that day and turned to carrie
it is to be observed that the man did not justify himself to himself
he was not troubling about that
his whole thought was the possibility of persuading carrie
nothing was wrong in that
he loved her dearly
their mutual happiness depended upon it
would that drouet were only away
while he was thinking thus elatedly he remembered that he wanted some clean linen in the morning
this he purchased together with a halfdozen ties and went to the palmer house
as he entered he thought he saw drouet ascending the stairs with a key
surely not drouet
then he thought perhaps they had changed their abode temporarily
he went straight up to the desk
is mr drouet stopping here he asked of the clerk
i think he is said the latter consulting his private registry list
yes is that so exclaimed hurstwood otherwise concealing his astonishment
alone he added
yes said the clerk
hurstwood turned away and set his lips so as best to express and conceal his feelings
hows that he thought
theyve had a row he hastened to his room with rising spirits and changed his linen
as he did so he made up his mind that if carrie was alone or if she had gone to another place it behooved him to find out
he decided to call at once
i know what ill do he thought
ill go to the door and ask if mr drouet is at home
that will bring out whether he is there or not and where carrie is he was almost moved to some muscular display as he thought of it
he decided to go immediately after supper
on coming down from his room at six he looked carefully about to see if drouet was present and then went out to lunch
he could scarcely eat however he was so anxious to be about his errand
before starting he thought it well to discover where drouet would be and returned to his hotel
has mr drouet gone out he asked of the clerk
no answered the latter hes in his room
do you wish to send up a card no ill call around later answered hurstwood and strolled out
he took a madison car and went direct to ogden place this time walking boldly up to the door
the chambermaid answered his knock
is mr drouet in said hurstwood blandly
he is out of the city said the girl who had heard carrie tell this to mrs hale
is mrs drouet in no she has gone to the theatre is that so said hurstwood considerably taken back then as if burdened with something important you dont know to which theatre the girl really had no idea where she had gone but not liking hurstwood and wishing to cause him trouble answered yes hooleys thank you returned the manager and tipping his hat slightly went away
ill look in at hooleys thought he but as a matter of fact he did not
before he had reached the central portion of the city he thought the whole matter over and decided it would be useless
as much as he longed to see carrie he knew she would be with some one and did not wish to intrude with his plea there
a little later he might do soin the morning
only in the morning he had the lawyer question before him
this little pilgrimage threw quite a wet blanket upon his rising spirits
he was soon down again to his old worry and reached the resort anxious to find relief
quite a company of gentlemen were making the place lively with their conversation
a group of cook county politicians were conferring about a round cherrywood table in the rear portion of the room
several young merrymakers were chattering at the bar before making a belated visit to the theatre
a shabbilygenteel individual with a red nose and an old high hat was sipping a quiet glass of ale alone at one end of the bar
hurstwood nodded to the politicians and went into his office
about ten oclock a friend of his mr frank l taintor a local sport and racing man dropped in and seeing hurstwood alone in his office came to the door
hello george he exclaimed
how are you frank said hurstwood somewhat relieved by the sight of him
sit down and he motioned him to one of the chairs in the little room
whats the matter george asked taintor
you look a little glum
havent lost at the track have you im not feeling very well tonight
i had a slight cold the other day take whiskey george said taintor
you ought to know that hurstwood smiled
while they were still conferring there several other of hurstwoods friends entered and not long after eleven the theatres being out some actors began to drop inamong them some notabilities
then began one of those pointless social conversations so common in american resorts where the wouldbe gilded attempt to rub off gilt from those who have it in abundance
if hurstwood had one leaning it was toward notabilities
he considered that if anywhere he belonged among them
he was too proud to toady too keen not to strictly observe the plane he occupied when there were those present who did not appreciate him but in situations like the present where he could shine as a gentleman and be received without equivocation as a friend and equal among men of known ability he was most delighted
it was on such occasions if ever that he would take something when the social flavour was strong enough he would even unbend to the extent of drinking glass for glass with his associates punctiliously observing his turn to pay as if he were an outsider like the others
if he ever approached intoxicationor rather that ruddy warmth and comfortableness which precedes the more sloven stateit was when individuals such as these were gathered about him when he was one of a circle of chatting celebrities
tonight disturbed as was his state he was rather relieved to find company and now that notabilities were gathered he laid aside his troubles for the nonce and joined in right heartily
it was not long before the imbibing began to tell
stories began to crop upthose everenduring droll stories which form the major portion of the conversation among american men under such circumstances
twelve oclock arrived the hour for closing and with it the company took leave
hurstwood shook hands with them most cordially
he was very roseate physically
he had arrived at that state where his mind though clear was nevertheless warm in its fancies
he felt as if his troubles were not very serious
going into his office he began to turn over certain accounts awaiting the departure of the bartenders and the cashier who soon left
it was the managers duty as well as his custom after all were gone to see that everything was safely closed up for the night
as a rule no money except the cash taken in after banking hours was kept about the place and that was locked in the safe by the cashier who with the owners was joint keeper of the secret combination but nevertheless hurstwood nightly took the precaution to try the cash drawers and the safe in order to see that they were tightly closed
then he would lock his own little office and set the proper light burning near the safe after which he would take his departure
never in his experience had he found anything out of order but tonight after shutting down his desk he came out and tried the safe
his way was to give a sharp pull
this time the door responded
he was slightly surprised at that and looking in found the money cases as left for the day apparently unprotected
his first thought was of course to inspect the drawers and shut the door
ill speak to mayhew about this tomorrow he thought
the latter had certainly imagined upon going out a halfhour before that he had turned the knob on the door so as to spring the lock
he had never failed to do so before
but tonight mayhew had other thoughts
he had been revolving the problem of a business of his own
ill look in here thought the manager pulling out the money drawers
he did not know why he wished to look in there
it was quite a superfluous action which another time might not have happened at all
as he did so a layer of bills in parcels of a thousand such as banks issue caught his eye
he could not tell how much they represented but paused to view them
then he pulled out the second of the cash drawers
in that were the receipts of the day
i didnt know fitzgerald and moy ever left any money this way his mind said to itself
they must have forgotten it he looked at the other drawer and paused again
count them said a voice in his ear
he put his hand into the first of the boxes and lifted the stack letting the separate parcels fall
they were bills of fifty and one hundred dollars done in packages of a thousand
he thought he counted ten such
why dont i shut the safe his mind said to itself lingering
what makes me pause here for answer there came the strangest words did you ever have ten thousand dollars in ready money lo the manager remembered that he had never had so much
all his property had been slowly accumulated and now his wife owned that
he was worth more than forty thousand all toldbut she would get that
he puzzled as he thought of these things then pushed in the drawers and closed the door pausing with his hand upon the knob which might so easily lock it all beyond temptation
still he paused
finally he went to the windows and pulled down the curtains
then he tried the door which he had previously locked
what was this thing making him suspicious
why did he wish to move about so quietly
he came back to the end of the counter as if to rest his arm and think
then he went and unlocked his little office door and turned on the light
he also opened his desk sitting down before it only to think strange thoughts
the safe is open said a voice
there is just the least little crack in it
the lock has not been sprung the manager floundered among a jumble of thoughts
now all the entanglement of the day came back
also the thought that here was a solution
that money would do it
if he had that and carrie
he rose up and stood stockstill looking at the floor
what about it his mind asked and for answer he put his hand slowly up and scratched his head
the manager was no fool to be led blindly away by such an errant proposition as this but his situation was peculiar
wine was in his veins
it had crept up into his head and given him a warm view of the situation
it also coloured the possibilities of ten thousand for him
he could see great opportunities with that
he could get carrie
oh yes he could
he could get rid of his wife
that letter too was waiting discussion tomorrow morning
he would not need to answer that
he went back to the safe and put his hand on the knob
then he pulled the door open and took the drawer with the money quite out
with it once out and before him it seemed a foolish thing to think about leaving it
certainly it would
why he could live quietly with carrie for years
lord
what was that
for the first time he was tense as if a stern hand had been laid upon his shoulder
he looked fearfully around
not a soul was present
not a sound
some one was shuffling by on the sidewalk
he took the box and the money and put it back in the safe
then he partly closed the door again
to those who have never wavered in conscience the predicament of the individual whose mind is less strongly constituted and who trembles in the balance between duty and desire is scarcely appreciable unless graphically portrayed
those who have never heard that solemn voice of the ghostly clock which ticks with awful distinctness thou shalt thou shalt not thou shalt thou shalt not are in no position to judge
not alone in sensitive highly organised natures is such a mental conflict possible
the dullest specimen of humanity when drawn by desire toward evil is recalled by a sense of right which is proportionate in power and strength to his evil tendency
we must remember that it may not be a knowledge of right for no knowledge of right is predicated of the animals instinctive recoil at evil
men are still led by instinct before they are regulated by knowledge
it is instinct which recalls the criminalit is instinct where highly organised reasoning is absent which gives the criminal his feeling of danger his fear of wrong
at every first adventure then into some untried evil the mind wavers
the clock of thought ticks out its wish and its denial
to those who have never experienced such a mental dilemma the following will appeal on the simple ground of revelation
when hurstwood put the money back his nature again resumed its ease and daring
no one had observed him
he was quite alone
no one could tell what he wished to do
he could work this thing out for himself
the imbibation of the evening had not yet worn off
moist as was his brow tremble as did his hand once after the nameless fright he was still flushed with the fumes of liquor
he scarcely noticed that the time was passing
he went over his situation once again his eye always seeing the money in a lump his mind always seeing what it would do
he strolled into his little room then to the door then to the safe again
he put his hand on the knob and opened it
there was the money
surely no harm could come from looking at it
he took out the drawer again and lifted the bills
they were so smooth so compact so portable
how little they made after all
he decided he would take them
yes he would
he would put them in his pocket
then he looked at that and saw they would not go there
his hand satchel
to be sure his hand satchel
they would go in thatall of it would
no one would think anything of it either
he went into the little office and took it from the shelf in the corner
now he set it upon his desk and went out toward the safe
for some reason he did not want to fill it out in the big room
first he brought the bills and then the loose receipts of the day
he would take it all
he put the empty drawers back and pushed the iron door almost to then stood beside it meditating
the wavering of a mind under such circumstances is an almost inexplicable thing and yet it is absolutely true
hurstwood could not bring himself to act definitely
he wanted to think about itto ponder over it to decide whether it were best
he was drawn by such a keen desire for carrie driven by such a state of turmoil in his own affairs that he thought constantly it would be best and yet he wavered
he did not know what evil might result from it to himhow soon he might come to grief
the true ethics of the situation never once occurred to him and never would have under any circumstances
after he had all the money in the handbag a revulsion of feeling seized him
he would not do itno
think of what a scandal it would make
the police
they would be after him
he would have to fly and where
oh the terror of being a fugitive from justice
he took out the two boxes and put all the money back
in his excitement he forgot what he was doing and put the sums in the wrong boxes
as he pushed the door to he thought he remembered doing it wrong and opened the door again
there were the two boxes mixed
he took them out and straightened the matter but now the terror had gone
why be afraid
while the money was in his hand the lock clicked
it had sprung
did he do it
he grabbed at the knob and pulled vigorously
it had closed
heavens
he was in for it now sure enough
the moment he realised that the safe was locked for a surety the sweat burst out upon his brow and he trembled violently
he looked about him and decided instantly
there was no delaying now
supposing i do lay it on the top he said and go away theyll know who took it
im the last to close up
besides other things will happen at once he became the man of action
i must get out of this he thought
he hurried into his little room took down his light overcoat and hat locked his desk and grabbed the satchel
then he turned out all but one light and opened the door
he tried to put on his old assured air but it was almost gone
he was repenting rapidly
i wish i hadnt done that he said
that was a mistake he walked steadily down the street greeting a night watchman whom he knew who was trying doors
he must get out of the city and that quickly
i wonder how the trains run he thought
instantly he pulled out his watch and looked
it was nearly halfpast one
at the first drugstore he stopped seeing a longdistance telephone booth inside
it was a famous drugstore and contained one of the first private telephone booths ever erected
i want to use your phone a minute he said to the night clerk
the latter nodded
give me he called to central after looking up the michigan central depot number
soon he got the ticket agent
how do the trains leave here for detroit he asked
the man explained the hours
no more tonight nothing with a sleeper
yes there is too he added
there is a mail train out of here at three oclock all right said hurstwood
what time does that get to detroit he was thinking if he could only get there and cross the river into canada he could take his time about getting to montreal
he was relieved to learn that it would reach there by noon
mayhew wont open the safe till nine he thought
they cant get on my track before noon then he thought of carrie
with what speed must he get her if he got her at all
she would have to come along
he jumped into the nearest cab standing by
to ogden place he said sharply
ill give you a dollar more if you make good time the cabby beat his horse into a sort of imitation gallop which was fairly fast however
on the way hurstwood thought what to do
reaching the number he hurried up the steps and did not spare the bell in waking the servant
is mrs drouet in he asked
yes said the astonished girl
tell her to dress and come to the door at once
her husband is in the hospital injured and wants to see her the servant girl hurried upstairs convinced by the mans strained and emphatic manner
what said carrie lighting the gas and searching for her clothes
mr
drouet is hurt and in the hospital
he wants to see you
the cabs downstairs carrie dressed very rapidly and soon appeared below forgetting everything save the necessities
drouet is hurt said hurstwood quickly
he wants to see you
come quickly carrie was so bewildered that she swallowed the whole story
get in said hurstwood helping her and jumping after
the cabby began to turn the horse around
michigan central depot he said standing up and speaking so low that carrie could not hear as fast as you can go chapter xxviii
a pilgrim an outlaw the spirit detained the cab had not travelled a short block before carrie settling herself and thoroughly waking in the night atmosphere asked whats the matter with him
is he hurt badly it isnt anything very serious hurstwood said solemnly
he was very much disturbed over his own situation and now that he had carrie with him he only wanted to get safely out of reach of the law
therefore he was in no mood for anything save such words as would further his plans distinctly
carrie did not forget that there was something to be settled between her and hurstwood but the thought was ignored in her agitation
the one thing was to finish this strange pilgrimage
where is he way out on the south side said hurstwood
well have to take the train
its the quickest way carrie said nothing and the horse gambolled on
the weirdness of the city by night held her attention
she looked at the long receding rows of lamps and studied the dark silent houses
how did he hurt himself she askedmeaning what was the nature of his injuries
hurstwood understood
he hated to lie any more than necessary and yet he wanted no protests until he was out of danger
i dont know exactly he said
they just called me up to go and get you and bring you out
they said there wasnt any need for alarm but that i shouldnt fail to bring you the mans serious manner convinced carrie and she became silent wondering
hurstwood examined his watch and urged the man to hurry
for one in so delicate a position he was exceedingly cool
he could only think of how needful it was to make the train and get quietly away
carrie seemed quite tractable and he congratulated himself
in due time they reached the depot and after helping her out he handed the man a fivedollar bill and hurried on
you wait here he said to carrie when they reached the waitingroom while i get the tickets have i much time to catch that train for detroit he asked of the agent
four minutes said the latter
he paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible
is it far said carrie as he hurried back
not very he said
we must get right in he pushed her before him at the gate stood between her and the ticket man while the latter punched their tickets so that she could not see and then hurried after
there was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two common day coaches
as the train had only recently been made up and few passengers were expected there were only one or two brakemen waiting
they entered the rear day coach and sat down
almost immediately all aboard resounded faintly from the outside and the train started
carrie began to think it was a little bit curiousthis going to a depotbut said nothing
the whole incident was so out of the natural that she did not attach too much weight to anything she imagined
how have you been asked hurstwood gently for he now breathed easier
very well said carrie who was so disturbed that she could not bring a proper attitude to bear in the matter
she was still nervous to reach drouet and see what could be the matter
hurstwood contemplated her and felt this
he was not disturbed that it should be so
he did not trouble because she was moved sympathetically in the matter
it was one of the qualities in her which pleased him exceedingly
he was only thinking how he should explain
even this was not the most serious thing in his mind however
his own deed and present flight were the great shadows which weighed upon him
what a fool i was to do that he said over and over
what a mistake in his sober senses he could scarcely realise that the thing had been done
he could not begin to feel that he was a fugitive from justice
he had often read of such things and had thought they must be terrible but now that the thing was upon him he only sat and looked into the past
the future was a thing which concerned the canadian line
he wanted to reach that
as for the rest he surveyed his actions for the evening and counted them parts of a great mistake
still he said what could i have done then he would decide to make the best of it and would begin to do so by starting the whole inquiry over again
it was a fruitless harassing round and left him in a queer mood to deal with the proposition he had in the presence of carrie
the train clacked through the yards along the lake front and ran rather slowly to twentyfourth street
brakes and signals were visible without
the engine gave short calls with its whistle and frequently the bell rang
several brakemen came through bearing lanterns
they were locking the vestibules and putting the cars in order for a long run
presently it began to gain speed and carrie saw the silent streets flashing by in rapid succession
the engine also began its whistlecalls of four parts with which it signalled danger to important crossings
is it very far asked carrie
not so very said hurstwood
he could hardly repress a smile at her simplicity
he wanted to explain and conciliate her but he also wanted to be well out of chicago
in the lapse of another halfhour it became apparent to carrie that it was quite a run to wherever he was taking her anyhow
is it in chicago she asked nervously
they were now far beyond the city limits and the train was scudding across the indiana line at a great rate
no he said not where we are going there was something in the way he said this which aroused her in an instant
her pretty brow began to contract
we are going to see charlie arent we she asked
he felt that the time was up
an explanation might as well come now as later
therefore he shook his head in the most gentle negative
what said carrie
she was nonplussed at the possibility of the errand being different from what she had thought
he only looked at her in the most kindly and mollifying way
well where are you taking me then she asked her voice showing the quality of fright
ill tell you carrie if youll be quiet
i want you to come along with me to another city oh said carrie her voice rising into a weak cry
let me off
i dont want to go with you she was quite appalled at the mans audacity
this was something which had never for a moment entered her head
her one thought now was to get off and away
if only the flying train could be stopped the terrible trick would be amended
she arose and tried to push out into the aisleanywhere
she knew she had to do something
hurstwood laid a gentle hand on her
sit still carrie he said
sit still
it wont do you any good to get up here
listen to me and ill tell you what ill do
wait a moment she was pushing at his knees but he only pulled her back
no one saw this little altercation for very few persons were in the car and they were attempting to doze
i wont said carrie who was nevertheless complying against her will
let me go she said
how dare you and large tears began to gather in her eyes
hurstwood was now fully aroused to the immediate difficulty and ceased to think of his own situation
he must do something with this girl or she would cause him trouble
he tried the art of persuasion with all his powers aroused
look here now carrie he said you mustnt act this way
i didnt mean to hurt your feelings
i dont want to do anything to make you feel bad oh sobbed carrie oh ohooo there there he said you mustnt cry
wont you listen to me
listen to me a minute and ill tell you why i came to do this thing
i couldnt help it
i assure you i couldnt
wont you listen her sobs disturbed him so that he was quite sure she did not hear a word he said
wont you listen he asked
no i wont said carrie flashing up
i want you to take me out of this or ill tell the conductor
i wont go with you
its a shame and again sobs of fright cut off her desire for expression
hurstwood listened with some astonishment
he felt that she had just cause for feeling as she did and yet he wished that he could straighten this thing out quickly
shortly the conductor would come through for the tickets
he wanted no noise no trouble of any kind
before everything he must make her quiet
you couldnt get out until the train stops again said hurstwood
it wont be very long until we reach another station
you can get out then if you want to
i wont stop you
all i want you to do is to listen a moment
youll let me tell you wont you carrie seemed not to listen
she only turned her head toward the window where outside all was black
the train was speeding with steady grace across the fields and through patches of wood
the long whistles came with sad musical effect as the lonely woodland crossings were approached
now the conductor entered the car and took up the one or two fares that had been added at chicago
he approached hurstwood who handed out the tickets
poised as she was to act carrie made no move
she did not look about
when the conductor had gone again hurstwood felt relieved
youre angry at me because i deceived you he said
i didnt mean to carrie
as i live i didnt
i couldnt help it
i couldnt stay away from you after the first time i saw you he was ignoring the last deception as something that might go by the board
he wanted to convince her that his wife could no longer be a factor in their relationship
the money he had stolen he tried to shut out of his mind
dont talk to me said carrie i hate you
i want you to go away from me
i am going to get out at the very next station she was in a tremble of excitement and opposition as she spoke
all right he said but youll hear me out wont you
after all you have said about loving me you might hear me
i dont want to do you any harm
ill give you the money to go back with when you go
i merely want to tell you carrie
you cant stop me from loving you whatever you may think he looked at her tenderly but received no reply
you think i have deceived you badly but i havent
i didnt do it willingly
im through with my wife
she hasnt any claims on me
ill never see her any more
thats why im here tonight
thats why i came and got you you said charlie was hurt said carrie savagely
you deceived me
youve been deceiving me all the time and now you want to force me to run away with you she was so excited that she got up and tried to get by him again
he let her and she took another seat
then he followed
dont run away from me carrie he said gently
let me explain
if you will only hear me out you will see where i stand
i tell you my wife is nothing to me
she hasnt been anything for years or i wouldnt have ever come near you
im going to get a divorce just as soon as i can
ill never see her again
im done with all that
youre the only person i want
if i can have you i wont ever think of another woman again carrie heard all this in a very ruffled state
it sounded sincere enough however despite all he had done
there was a tenseness in hurstwoods voice and manner which could but have some effect
she did not want anything to do with him
he was married he had deceived her once and now again and she thought him terrible
still there is something in such daring and power which is fascinating to a woman especially if she can be made to feel that it is all prompted by love of her
the progress of the train was having a great deal to do with the solution of this difficult situation
the speeding wheels and disappearing country put chicago farther and farther behind
carrie could feel that she was being borne a long distance offthat the engine was making an almost through run to some distant city
she felt at times as if she could cry out and make such a row that some one would come to her aid at other times it seemed an almost useless thingso far was she from any aid no matter what she did
all the while hurstwood was endeavouring to formulate his plea in such a way that it would strike home and bring her into sympathy with him
i was simply put where i didnt know what else to do carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this
when i say you wouldnt come unless i could marry you i decided to put everything else behind me and get you to come away with me
im going off now to another city
i want to go to montreal for a while and then anywhere you want to
well go and live in new york if you say ill not have anything to do with you said carrie
i want to get off this train
where are we going to detroit said hurstwood
oh said carrie in a burst of anguish
so distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty
wont you come along with me he said as if there was great danger that she would not
you wont need to do anything but travel with me
ill not trouble you in any way
you can see montreal and new york and then if you dont want to stay you can go back
it will be better than trying to go back tonight the first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for carrie
it seemed a plausible thing to do much as she feared his opposition if she tried to carry it out
montreal and new york
even now she was speeding toward those great strange lands and could see them if she liked
she thought but made no sign
hurstwood thought he saw a shade of compliance in this
he redoubled his ardour
think he said what ive given up
i cant go back to chicago any more
ive got to stay away and live alone now if you dont come with me
you wont go back on me entirely will you carrie i dont want you to talk to me she answered forcibly
hurstwood kept silent for a while
carrie felt the train to be slowing down
it was the moment to act if she was to act at all
she stirred uneasily
dont think of going carrie he said
if you ever cared for me at all come along and lets start right
ill do whatever you say
ill marry you or ill let you go back
give yourself time to think it over
i wouldnt have wanted you to come if i hadnt loved you
i tell you carrie before god i cant live without you
i wont there was the tensity of fierceness in the mans plea which appealed deeply to her sympathies
it was a dissolving fire which was actuating him now
he was loving her too intensely to think of giving her up in this his hour of distress
he clutched her hand nervously and pressed it with all the force of an appeal
the train was now all but stopped
it was running by some cars on a side track
everything outside was dark and dreary
a few sprinkles on the window began to indicate that it was raining
carrie hung in a quandary balancing between decision and helplessness
now the train stopped and she was listening to his plea
the engine backed a few feet and all was still
she wavered totally unable to make a move
minute after minute slipped by and still she hesitated he pleading
will you let me come back if i want to she asked as if she now had the upper hand and her companion was utterly subdued
of course he answered you know i will carrie only listened as one who has granted a temporary amnesty
she began to feel as if the matter were in her hands entirely
the train was again in rapid motion
hurstwood changed the subject
arent you very tired he said
no she answered
wont you let me get you a berth in the sleeper she shook her head though for all her distress and his trickery she was beginning to notice what she had always felthis thoughtfulness
oh yes he said you will feel so much better she shook her head
let me fix my coat for you anyway and he arose and arranged his light coat in a comfortable position to receive her head
there he said tenderly now see if you cant rest a little he could have kissed her for her compliance
he took his seat beside her and thought a moment
i believe were in for a heavy rain he said
so it looks said carrie whose nerves were quieting under the sound of the rain drops driven by a gusty wind as the train swept on frantically through the shadow to a newer world
the fact that he had in a measure mollified carrie was a source of satisfaction to hurstwood but it furnished only the most temporary relief
now that her opposition was out of the way he had all of his time to devote to the consideration of his own error
his condition was bitter in the extreme for he did not want the miserable sum he had stolen
he did not want to be a thief
that sum or any other could never compensate for the state which he had thus foolishly doffed
it could not give him back his host of friends his name his house and family nor carrie as he had meant to have her
he was shut out from chicagofrom his easy comfortable state
he had robbed himself of his dignity his merry meetings his pleasant evenings
and for what
the more he thought of it the more unbearable it became
he began to think that he would try and restore himself to his old state
he would return the miserable thievings of the night and explain
perhaps moy would understand
perhaps they would forgive him and let him come back
by noontime the train rolled into detroit and he began to feel exceedingly nervous
the police must be on his track by now
they had probably notified all the police of the big cities and detectives would be watching for him
he remembered instances in which defaulters had been captured
consequently he breathed heavily and paled somewhat
his hands felt as if they must have something to do
he simulated interest in several scenes without which he did not feel
he repeatedly beat his foot upon the floor
carrie noticed his agitation but said nothing
she had no idea what it meant or that it was important
he wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went on through to montreal or some canadian point
perhaps he could have saved time
he jumped up and sought the conductor
does any part of this train go to montreal he asked
yes the next sleeper back does he would have asked more but it did not seem wise so he decided to inquire at the depot
the train rolled into the yards clanging and puffing
i think we had better go right on through to montreal he said to carrie
ill see what the connections are when we get off he was exceedingly nervous but did his best to put on a calm exterior
carrie only looked at him with large troubled eyes
she was drifting mentally unable to say to herself what to do
the train stopped and hurstwood led the way out
he looked warily around him pretending to look after carrie
seeing nothing that indicated studied observation he made his way to the ticket office
the next train for montreal leaves when he asked
in twenty minutes said the man
he bought two tickets and pullman berths
then he hastened back to carrie
we go right out again he said scarcely noticing that carrie looked tired and weary
i wish i was out of all this she exclaimed gloomily
youll feel better when we reach montreal he said
i havent an earthly thing with me said carrie not even a handkerchief you can buy all you want as soon as you get there dearest he explained
you can call in a dressmaker now the crier called the train ready and they got on
hurstwood breathed a sigh of relief as it started
there was a short run to the river and there they were ferried over
they had barely pulled the train off the ferryboat when he settled back with a sigh
it wont be so very long now he said remembering her in his relief
we get there the first thing in the morning carrie scarcely deigned to reply
ill see if there is a diningcar he added
im hungry chapter xxix
the solace of travel the boats of the sea to the untravelled territory other than their own familiar heath is invariably fascinating
next to love it is the one thing which solaces and delights
things new are too important to be neglected and mind which is a mere reflection of sensory impressions succumbs to the flood of objects
thus lovers are forgotten sorrows laid aside death hidden from view
there is a world of accumulated feeling back of the trite dramatic expressioni am going away as carrie looked out upon the flying scenery she almost forgot that she had been tricked into this long journey against her will and that she was without the necessary apparel for travelling
she quite forgot hurstwoods presence at times and looked away to homely farmhouses and cosey cottages in villages with wondering eyes
it was an interesting world to her
her life had just begun
she did not feel herself defeated at all
neither was she blasted in hope
the great city held much
possibly she would come out of bondage into freedomwho knows
perhaps she would be happy
these thoughts raised her above the level of erring
she was saved in that she was hopeful
the following morning the train pulled safely into montreal and they stepped down hurstwood glad to be out of danger carrie wondering at the novel atmosphere of the northern city
long before hurstwood had been here and now he remembered the name of the hotel at which he had stopped
as they came out of the main entrance of the depot he heard it called anew by a busman
well go right up and get rooms he said
at the clerks office hurstwood swung the register about while the clerk came forward
he was thinking what name he would put down
with the latter before him he found no time for hesitation
a name he had seen out of the car window came swiftly to him
it was pleasing enough
with an easy hand he wrote g
w murdock and wife it was the largest concession to necessity he felt like making
his initials he could not spare
when they were shown their room carrie saw at once that he had secured her a lovely chamber
you have a bath there said he
now you can clean up when you get ready carrie went over and looked out the window while hurstwood looked at himself in the glass
he felt dusty and unclean
he had no trunk no change of linen not even a hairbrush
ill ring for soap and towels he said and send you up a hairbrush
then you can bathe and get ready for breakfast
ill go for a shave and come back and get you and then well go out and look for some clothes for you he smiled goodnaturedly as he said this
all right said carrie
she sat down in one of the rockingchairs while hurstwood waited for the boy who soon knocked
soap towels and a pitcher of icewater yes sir ill go now he said to carrie coming toward her and holding out his hands but she did not move to take them
youre not mad at me are you he asked softly
oh no she answered rather indifferently
dont you care for me at all she made no answer but looked steadily toward the window
dont you think you could love me a little he pleaded taking one of her hands which she endeavoured to draw away
you once said you did what made you deceive me so asked carrie
i couldnt help it he said i wanted you too much you didnt have any right to want me she answered striking cleanly home
oh well carrie he answered here i am
its too late now
wont you try and care for me a little he looked rather worsted in thought as he stood before her
she shook her head negatively
let me start all over again
be my wife from today on carrie rose up as if to step away he holding her hand
now he slipped his arm about her and she struggled but in vain
he held her quite close
instantly there flamed up in his body the all compelling desire
his affection took an ardent form
let me go said carrie who was folded close to him
wont you love me he said
wont you be mine from now on carrie had never been illdisposed toward him
only a moment before she had been listening with some complacency remembering her old affection for him
he was so handsome so daring
now however this feeling had changed to one of opposition which rose feebly
it mastered her for a moment and then held close as she was began to wane
something else in her spoke
this man to whose bosom she was being pressed was strong he was passionate he loved her and she was alone
if she did not turn to himaccept of his lovewhere else might she go
her resistance half dissolved in the flood of his strong feeling
she found him lifting her head and looking into her eyes
what magnetism there was she could never know
his many sins however were for the moment all forgotten
he pressed her closer and kissed her and she felt that further opposition was useless
will you marry me she asked forgetting how
this very day he said with all delight
now the hallboy pounded on the door and he released his hold upon her regretfully
you get ready now will you he said at once yes she answered
ill be back in threequarters of an hour carrie flushed and excited moved away as he admitted the boy
below stairs he halted in the lobby to look for a barber shop
for the moment he was in fine feather
his recent victory over carrie seemed to atone for much he had endured during the last few days
life seemed worth fighting for
this eastward flight from all things customary and attached seemed as if it might have happiness in store
the storm showed a rainbow at the end of which might be a pot of gold
he was about to cross to a little redandwhite striped bar which was fastened up beside a door when a voice greeted him familiarly
instantly his heart sank
why hello george old man said the voice
what are you doing down here hurstwood was already confronted and recognised his friend kenny the stockbroker
just attending to a little private matter he answered his mind working like a keyboard of a telephone station
this man evidently did not knowhe had not read the papers
well it seems strange to see you way up here said mr kenny genially
stopping here yes said hurstwood uneasily thinking of his handwriting on the register
going to be in town long no only a day or so is that so
had your breakfast yes said hurstwood lying blandly
im just going for a shave wont you come have a drink not until afterwards said the exmanager
ill see you later
are you stopping here yes said mr kenny and then turning the word again added how are things out in chicago about the same as usual said hurstwood smiling genially
wife with you no well i must see more of you today
im just going in here for breakfast
come in when youre through i will said hurstwood moving away
the whole conversation was a trial to him
it seemed to add complications with every word
this man called up a thousand memories
he represented everything he had left
chicago his wife the elegant resortall these were in his greeting and inquiries
and here he was in this same hotel expecting to confer with him unquestionably waiting to have a good time with him
all at once the chicago papers would arrive
the local papers would have accounts in them this very day
he forgot his triumph with carrie in the possibility of soon being known for what he was in this mans eyes a safebreaker
he could have groaned as he went into the barber shop
he decided to escape and seek a more secluded hotel
accordingly when he came out he was glad to see the lobby clear and hastened toward the stairs
he would get carrie and go out by the ladies entrance
they would have breakfast in some more inconspicuous place
across the lobby however another individual was surveying him
he was of a commonplace irish type small of stature cheaply dressed and with a head that seemed a smaller edition of some huge ward politicians
this individual had been evidently talking with the clerk but now he surveyed the exmanager keenly
hurstwood felt the longrange examination and recognised the type
instinctively he felt that the man was a detectivethat he was being watched
he hurried across pretending not to notice but in his mind was a world of thoughts
what would happen now
what could these people do
he began to trouble concerning the extradition laws
he did not understand them absolutely
perhaps he could be arrested
oh if carrie should find out
montreal was too warm for him
he began to long to be out of it
carrie had bathed and was waiting when he arrived
she looked refreshedmore delightful than ever but reserved
since he had gone she had resumed somewhat of her cold attitude towards him
love was not blazing in her heart
he felt it and his troubles seemed increased
he could not take her in his arms he did not even try
something about her forbade it
in part his opinion was the result of his own experiences and reflections below stairs
youre ready are you he said kindly
yes she answered
well go out for breakfast
this place down here doesnt appeal to me very much all right said carrie
they went out and at the corner the commonplace irish individual was standing eyeing him
hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chaps presence
the insolence in the fellows eye was galling
still they passed and he explained to carrie concerning the city
another restaurant was not long in showing itself and here they entered
what a queer town this is said carrie who marvelled at it solely because it was not like chicago
it isnt as lively as chicago said hurstwood
dont you like it no said carrie whose feelings were already localised in the great western city
well it isnt as interesting said hurstwood
whats here asked carrie wondering at his choosing to visit this town
nothing much returned hurstwood
its quite a resort
theres some pretty scenery about here carrie listened but with a feeling of unrest
there was much about her situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation
we wont stay here long said hurstwood who was now really glad to note her dissatisfaction
you pick out your clothes as soon as breakfast is over and well run down to new york soon
youll like that
its a lot more like a city than any place outside chicago he was really planning to slip out and away
he would see what these detectives would dowhat move his employers at chicago would makethen he would slip awaydown to new york where it was easy to hide
he knew enough about that city to know that its mysteries and possibilities of mystification were infinite
the more he thought however the more wretched his situation became
he saw that getting here did not exactly clear up the ground
the firm would probably employ detectives to watch himpinkerton men or agents of mooney and boland
they might arrest him the moment he tried to leave canada
so he might be compelled to remain here months and in what a state
back at the hotel hurstwood was anxious and yet fearful to see the morning papers
he wanted to know how far the news of his criminal deed had spread
so he told carrie he would be up in a few moments and went to secure and scan the dailies
no familiar or suspicious faces were about and yet he did not like reading in the lobby so he sought the main parlour on the floor above and seated by a window there looked them over
very little was given to his crime but it was there several sticks in all among all the riffraff of telegraphed murders accidents marriages and other news
he wished half sadly that he could undo it all
every moment of his time in this faroff abode of safety but added to his feeling that he had made a great mistake
there could have been an easier way out if he had only known
he left the papers before going to the room thinking thus to keep them out of the hands of carrie
well how are you feeling he asked of her
she was engaged in looking out of the window
oh all right she answered
he came over and was about to begin a conversation with her when a knock came at their door
maybe its one of my parcels said carrie
hurstwood opened the door outside of which stood the individual whom he had so thoroughly suspected
youre mr hurstwood are you said the latter with a volume of affected shrewdness and assurance
yes said hurstwood calmly
he knew the type so thoroughly that some of his old familiar indifference to it returned
such men as these were of the lowest stratum welcomed at the resort
he stepped out and closed the door
well you know what i am here for dont you said the man confidentially
i can guess said hurstwood softly
well do you intend to try and keep the money thats my affair said hurstwood grimly
you cant do it you know said the detective eyeing him coolly
look here my man said hurstwood authoritatively you dont understand anything about this case and i cant explain to you
whatever i intend to do ill do without advice from the outside
youll have to excuse me well now theres no use of your talking that way said the man when youre in the hands of the police
we can make a lot of trouble for you if we want to
youre not registered right in this house you havent got your wife with you and the newspapers dont know youre here yet
you might as well be reasonable what do you want to know asked hurstwood
whether youre going to send back that money or not hurstwood paused and studied the floor
theres no use explaining to you about this he said at last
theres no use of your asking me
im no fool you know
i know just what you can do and what you cant
you can create a lot of trouble if you want to
i know that all right but it wont help you to get the money
now ive made up my mind what to do
ive already written fitzgerald and moy so theres nothing i can say
you wait until you hear more from them all the time he had been talking he had been moving away from the door down the corridor out of the hearing of carrie
they were now near the end where the corridor opened into the large general parlour
you wont give it up said the man
the words irritated hurstwood greatly
hot blood poured into his brain
many thoughts formulated themselves
he was no thief
he didnt want the money
if he could only explain to fitzgerald and moy maybe it would be all right again
see here he said theres no use my talking about this at all
i respect your power all right but ill have to deal with the people who know well you cant get out of canada with it said the man
i dont want to get out said hurstwood
when i get ready therell be nothing to stop me for he turned back and the detective watched him closely
it seemed an intolerable thing
still he went on and into the room
who was it asked carrie
a friend of mine from chicago the whole of this conversation was such a shock that coming as it did after all the other worry of the past week it sufficed to induce a deep gloom and moral revulsion in hurstwood
what hurt him most was the fact that he was being pursued as a thief
he began to see the nature of that social injustice which sees but one sideoften but a single point in a long tragedy
all the newspapers noted but one thing his taking the money
how and wherefore were but indifferently dealt with
all the complications which led up to it were unknown
he was accused without being understood
sitting in his room with carrie the same day he decided to send the money back
he would write fitzgerald and moy explain all and then send it by express
maybe they would forgive him
perhaps they would ask him back
he would make good the false statement he had made about writing them
then he would leave this peculiar town
for an hour he thought over this plausible statement of the tangle
he wanted to tell them about his wife but couldnt
he finally narrowed it down to an assertion that he was lightheaded from entertaining friends had found the safe open and having gone so far as to take the money out had accidentally closed it
this act he regretted very much
he was sorry he had put them to so much trouble
he would undo what he could by sending the money backthe major portion of it
the remainder he would pay up as soon as he could
was there any possibility of his being restored
this he only hinted at
the troubled state of the mans mind may be judged by the very construction of this letter
for the nonce he forgot what a painful thing it would be to resume his old place even if it were given him
he forgot that he had severed himself from the past as by a sword and that if he did manage to in some way reunite himself with it the jagged line of separation and reunion would always show
he was always forgetting somethinghis wife carrie his need of money present situation or somethingand so did not reason clearly
nevertheless he sent the letter waiting a reply before sending the money
meanwhile he accepted his present situation with carrie getting what joy out of it he could
out came the sun by noon and poured a golden flood through their open windows
sparrows were twittering
there were laughter and song in the air
hurstwood could not keep his eyes from carrie
she seemed the one ray of sunshine in all his trouble
oh if she would only love him whollyonly throw her arms around him in the blissful spirit in which he had seen her in the little park in chicagohow happy he would be
it would repay him it would show him that he had not lost all
he would not care
carrie he said getting up once and coming over to her are you going to stay with me from now on she looked at him quizzically but melted with sympathy as the value of the look upon his face forced itself upon her
it was love now keen and stronglove enhanced by difficulty and worry
she could not help smiling
let me be everything to you from now on he said
dont make me worry any more
ill be true to you
well go to new york and get a nice flat
ill go into business again and well be happy
wont you be mine carrie listened quite solemnly
there was no great passion in her but the drift of things and this mans proximity created a semblance of affection
she felt rather sorry for hima sorrow born of what had only recently been a great admiration
true love she had never felt for him
she would have known as much if she could have analysed her feelings but this thing which she now felt aroused by his great feeling broke down the barriers between them
youll stay with me wont you he asked
yes she said nodding her head
he gathered her to himself imprinting kisses upon her lips and cheeks
you must marry me though she said
ill get a license today he answered
how she asked
under a new name he answered
ill take a new name and live a new life
from now on im murdock oh dont take that name said carrie
why not he said
i dont like it well what shall i take he asked
oh anything only dont take that he thought a while still keeping his arms about her and then said how would wheeler do thats all right said carrie
well then wheeler he said
ill get the license this afternoon they were married by a baptist minister the first divine they found convenient
at last the chicago firm answered
it was by mr moys dictation
he was astonished that hurstwood had done this very sorry that it had come about as it had
if the money were returned they would not trouble to prosecute him as they really bore him no illwill
as for his returning or their restoring him to his former position they had not quite decided what the effect of it would be
they would think it over and correspond with him later possibly after a little time and so on
the sum and substance of it was that there was no hope and they wanted the money with the least trouble possible
hurstwood read his doom
he decided to pay to the agent whom they said they would send keeping for his own use
he telegraphed his acquiescence explained to the representative who called at the hotel the same day took a certificate of payment and told carrie to pack her trunk
he was slightly depressed over this newest move at the time he began to make it but eventually restored himself
he feared that even yet he might be seized and taken back so he tried to conceal his movements but it was scarcely possible
he ordered carries trunk sent to the depot where he had it sent by express to new york
no one seemed to be observing him but he left at night
he was greatly agitated lest at the first station across the border or at the depot in new york there should be waiting for him an officer of the law
carrie ignorant of his theft and his fears enjoyed the entry into the latter city in the morning
the round green hills sentinelling the broad expansive bosom of the hudson held her attention by their beauty as the train followed the line of the stream
she had heard of the hudson river the great city of new york and now she looked out filling her mind with the wonder of it
as the train turned east at spuyten duyvil and followed the east bank of the harlem river hurstwood nervously called her attention to the fact that they were on the edge of the city
after her experience with chicago she expected long lines of carsa great highway of tracksand noted the difference
the sight of a few boats in the harlem and more in the east river tickled her young heart
it was the first sign of the great sea
next came a plain street with fivestory brick flats and then the train plunged into the tunnel
grand central station called the trainman as after a few minutes of darkness and smoke daylight reappeared
hurstwood arose and gathered up his small grip
he was screwed up to the highest tension
with carrie he waited at the door and then dismounted
no one approached him but he glanced furtively to and fro as he made for the street entrance
so excited was he that he forgot all about carrie who fell behind wondering at his selfabsorption
as he passed through the depot proper the strain reached its climax and began to wane
all at once he was on the sidewalk and none but cabmen hailed him
he heaved a great breath and turned remembering carrie
i thought you were going to run off and leave me she said
i was trying to remember which car takes us to the gilsey he answered
carrie hardly heard him so interested was she in the busy scene
how large is new york she asked
oh a million or more said hurstwood
he looked around and hailed a cab but he did so in a changed way
for the first time in years the thought that he must count these little expenses flashed through his mind
it was a disagreeable thing
he decided he would lose no time living in hotels but would rent a flat
accordingly he told carrie and she agreed
well look today if you want to she said
suddenly he thought of his experience in montreal
at the more important hotels he would be certain to meet chicagoans whom he knew
he stood up and spoke to the driver
take me to the belford he said knowing it to be less frequented by those whom he knew
then he sat down
where is the residence part asked carrie who did not take the tall fivestory walls on either hand to be the abodes of families
everywhere said hurstwood who knew the city fairly well
there are no lawns in new york
all these are houses well then i dont like it said carrie who was coming to have a few opinions of her own
chapter xxx
the kingdom of greatness the pilgrim adream whatever a man like hurstwood could be in chicago it is very evident that he would be but an inconspicuous drop in an ocean like new york
in chicago whose population still ranged about millionaires were not numerous
the rich had not become so conspicuously rich as to drown all moderate incomes in obscurity
the attention of the inhabitants was not so distracted by local celebrities in the dramatic artistic social and religious fields as to shut the wellpositioned man from view
in chicago the two roads to distinction were politics and trade
in new york the roads were any one of a halfhundred and each had been diligently pursued by hundreds so that celebrities were numerous
the sea was already full of whales
a common fish must needs disappear wholly from viewremain unseen
in other words hurstwood was nothing
there is a more subtle result of such a situation as this which though not always taken into account produces the tragedies of the world
the great create an atmosphere which reacts badly upon the small
this atmosphere is easily and quickly felt
walk among the magnificent residences the splendid equipages the gilded shops restaurants resorts of all kinds scent the flowers the silks the wines drink of the laughter springing from the soul of luxurious content of the glances which gleam like light from defiant spears feel the quality of the smiles which cut like glistening swords and of strides born of place and you shall know of what is the atmosphere of the high and mighty
little use to argue that of such is not the kingdom of greatness but so long as the world is attracted by this and the human heart views this as the one desirable realm which it must attain so long to that heart will this remain the realm of greatness
so long also will the atmosphere of this realm work its desperate results in the soul of man
it is like a chemical reagent
one day of it like one drop of the other will so affect and discolour the views the aims the desire of the mind that it will thereafter remain forever dyed
a day of it to the untried mind is like opium to the untried body
a craving is set up which if gratified shall eternally result in dreams and death
aye
dreams unfulfilledgnawing luring idle phantoms which beckon and lead beckon and lead until death and dissolution dissolve their power and restore us blind to natures heart
a man of hurstwoods age and temperament is not subject to the illusions and burning desires of youth but neither has he the strength of hope which gushes as a fountain in the heart of youth
such an atmosphere could not incite in him the cravings of a boy of eighteen but in so far as they were excited the lack of hope made them proportionately bitter
he could not fail to notice the signs of affluence and luxury on every hand
he had been to new york before and knew the resources of its folly
in part it was an awesome place to him for here gathered all that he most respected on this earthwealth place and fame
the majority of the celebrities with whom he had tipped glasses in his day as manager hailed from this selfcentred and populous spot
the most inviting stories of pleasure and luxury had been told of places and individuals here
he knew it to be true that unconsciously he was brushing elbows with fortune the livelong day that a hundred or five hundred thousand gave no one the privilege of living more than comfortably in so wealthy a place
fashion and pomp required more ample sums so that the poor man was nowhere
all this he realised now quite sharply as he faced the city cut off from his friends despoiled of his modest fortune and even his name and forced to begin the battle for place and comfort all over again
he was not old but he was not so dull but that he could feel he soon would be
of a sudden then this show of fine clothes place and power took on peculiar significance
it was emphasised by contrast with his own distressing state
and it was distressing
he soon found that freedom from fear of arrest was not the sine qua non of his existence
that danger dissolved the next necessity became the grievous thing
the paltry sum of thirteen hundred and some odd dollars set against the need of rent clothing food and pleasure for years to come was a spectacle little calculated to induce peace of mind in one who had been accustomed to spend five times that sum in the course of a year
he thought upon the subject rather actively the first few days he was in new york and decided that he must act quickly
as a consequence he consulted the business opportunities advertised in the morning papers and began investigations on his own account
that was not before he had become settled however
carrie and he went looking for a flat as arranged and found one in seventyeighth street near amsterdam avenue
it was a fivestory building and their flat was on the third floor
owing to the fact that the street was not yet built up solidly it was possible to see east to the green tops of the trees in central park and west to the broad waters of the hudson a glimpse of which was to be had out of the west windows
for the privilege of six rooms and a bath running in a straight line they were compelled to pay thirtyfive dollars a monthan average and yet exorbitant rent for a home at the time
carrie noticed the difference between the size of the rooms here and in chicago and mentioned it
youll not find anything better dear said hurstwood unless you go into one of the oldfashioned houses and then you wont have any of these conveniences carrie picked out the new abode because of its newness and bright woodwork
it was one of the very new ones supplied with steam heat which was a great advantage
the stationary range hot and cold water dumbwaiter speaking tubes and callbell for the janitor pleased her very much
she had enough of the instincts of a housewife to take great satisfaction in these things
hurstwood made arrangements with one of the instalment houses whereby they furnished the flat complete and accepted fifty dollars down and ten dollars a month
he then had a little plate bearing the name g w wheeler made which he placed on his letterbox in the hall
it sounded exceedingly odd to carrie to be called mrs wheeler by the janitor but in time she became used to it and looked upon the name as her own
these house details settled hurstwood visited some of the advertised opportunities to purchase an interest in some flourishing downtown bar
after the palatial resort in adams street he could not stomach the commonplace saloons which he found advertised
he lost a number of days looking up these and finding them disagreeable
he did however gain considerable knowledge by talking for he discovered the influence of tammany hall and the value of standing in with the police
the most profitable and flourishing places he found to be those which conducted anything but a legitimate business such as that controlled by fitzgerald and moy
elegant back rooms and private drinking booths on the second floor were usually adjuncts of very profitable places
he saw by portly keepers whose shirt fronts shone with large diamonds and whose clothes were properly cut that the liquor business here as elsewhere yielded the same golden profit
at last he found an individual who had a resort in warren street which seemed an excellent venture
it was fairly wellappearing and susceptible of improvement
the owner claimed the business to be excellent and it certainly looked so
we deal with a very good class of people he told hurstwood
merchants salesmen and professionals
its a welldressed class
no bums
we dont allow em in the place hurstwood listened to the cashregister ring and watched the trade for a while
its profitable enough for two is it he asked
you can see for yourself if youre any judge of the liquor trade said the owner
this is only one of the two places i have
the other is down in nassau street
i cant tend to them both alone
if i had some one who knew the business thoroughly i wouldnt mind sharing with him in this one and letting him manage it ive had experience enough said hurstwood blandly but he felt a little diffident about referring to fitzgerald and moy
well you can suit yourself mr wheeler said the proprietor
he only offered a third interest in the stock fixtures and goodwill and this in return for a thousand dollars and managerial ability on the part of the one who should come in
there was no property involved because the owner of the saloon merely rented from an estate
the offer was genuine enough but it was a question with hurstwood whether a third interest in that locality could be made to yield one hundred and fifty dollars a month which he figured he must have in order to meet the ordinary family expenses and be comfortable
it was not the time however after many failures to find what he wanted to hesitate
it looked as though a third would pay a hundred a month now
by judicious management and improvement it might be made to pay more
accordingly he agreed to enter into partnership and made over his thousand dollars preparing to enter the next day
his first inclination was to be elated and he confided to carrie that he thought he had made an excellent arrangement
time however introduced food for reflection
he found his partner to be very disagreeable
frequently he was the worse for liquor which made him surly
this was the last thing which hurstwood was used to in business
besides the business varied
it was nothing like the class of patronage which he had enjoyed in chicago
he found that it would take a long time to make friends
these people hurried in and out without seeking the pleasures of friendship
it was no gathering or lounging place
whole days and weeks passed without one such hearty greeting as he had been wont to enjoy every day in chicago
for another thing hurstwood missed the celebritiesthose welldressed lite individuals who lend grace to the average bars and bring news from faroff and exclusive circles
he did not see one such in a month
evenings when still at his post he would occasionally read in the evening papers incidents concerning celebrities whom he knewwhom he had drunk a glass with many a time
they would visit a bar like fitzgerald and moys in chicago or the hoffman house uptown but he knew that he would never see them down here
again the business did not pay as well as he thought
it increased a little but he found he would have to watch his household expenses which was humiliating
in the very beginning it was a delight to go home late at night as he did and find carrie
he managed to run up and take dinner with her between six and seven and to remain home until nine oclock in the morning but the novelty of this waned after a time and he began to feel the drag of his duties
the first month had scarcely passed before carrie said in a very natural way i think ill go down this week and buy a dress what kind said hurstwood
oh something for street wear all right he answered smiling although he noted mentally that it would be more agreeable to his finances if she didnt
nothing was said about it the next day but the following morning he asked have you done anything about your dress not yet said carrie
he paused a few moments as if in thought and then said would you mind putting it off a few days no replied carrie who did not catch the drift of his remarks
she had never thought of him in connection with money troubles before
why well ill tell you said hurstwood
this investment of mine is taking a lot of money just now
i expect to get it all back shortly but just at present i am running close oh answered carrie
why certainly dear
why didnt you tell me before it wasnt necessary said hurstwood
for all her acquiescence there was something about the way hurstwood spoke which reminded carrie of drouet and his little deal which he was always about to put through
it was only the thought of a second but it was a beginning
it was something new in her thinking of hurstwood
other things followed from time to time little things of the same sort which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation
carrie was not dull by any means
two persons cannot long dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another
the mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he voluntarily confesses them or not
trouble gets in the air and contributes gloom which speaks for itself
hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual but they were the same clothes he had in canada
carrie noticed that he did not install a large wardrobe though his own was anything but large
she noticed also that he did not suggest many amusements said nothing about the food seemed concerned about his business
this was not the easy hurstwood of chicagonot the liberal opulent hurstwood she had known
the change was too obvious to escape detection
in time she began to feel that a change had come about and that she was not in his confidence
he was evidently secretive and kept his own counsel
she found herself asking him questions about little things
this is a disagreeable state to a woman
great love makes it seem reasonable sometimes plausible but never satisfactory
where great love is not a more definite and less satisfactory conclusion is reached
as for hurstwood he was making a great fight against the difficulties of a changed condition
he was too shrewd not to realise the tremendous mistake he had made and appreciate that he had done well in getting where he was and yet he could not help contrasting his present state with his former hour after hour and day after day
besides he had the disagreeable fear of meeting oldtime friends ever since one such encounter which he made shortly after his arrival in the city
it was in broadway that he saw a man approaching him whom he knew
there was no time for simulating nonrecognition
the exchange of glances had been too sharp the knowledge of each other too apparent
so the friend a buyer for one of the chicago wholesale houses felt perforce the necessity of stopping
how are you he said extending his hand with an evident mixture of feeling and a lack of plausible interest
very well said hurstwood equally embarrassed
how is it with you all right im down here doing a little buying
are you located here now yes said hurstwood i have a place down in warren street is that so said the friend
glad to hear it
ill come down and see you do said hurstwood
so long said the other smiling affably and going on
he never asked for my number thought hurstwood he wouldnt think of coming he wiped his forehead which had grown damp and hoped sincerely he would meet no one else
these things told upon his goodnature such as it was
his one hope was that things would change for the better in a money way
he had carrie
his furniture was being paid for
he was maintaining his position
as for carrie the amusements he could give her would have to do for the present
he could probably keep up his pretensions sufficiently long without exposure to make good and then all would be well
he failed therein to take account of the frailties of human naturethe difficulties of matrimonial life
carrie was young
with him and with her varying mental states were common
at any moment the extremes of feeling might be antipolarised at the dinner table
this often happens in the best regulated families
little things brought out on such occasions need great love to obliterate them afterward
where that is not both parties count two and two and make a problem after a while
chapter xxxi
a pet of good fortune broadway flaunts its joys the effect of the city and his own situation on hurstwood was paralleled in the case of carrie who accepted the things which fortune provided with the most genial goodnature
new york despite her first expression of disapproval soon interested her exceedingly
its clear atmosphere more populous thoroughfares and peculiar indifference struck her forcibly
she had never seen such a little flat as hers and yet it soon enlisted her affection
the new furniture made an excellent showing the sideboard which hurstwood himself arranged gleamed brightly
the furniture for each room was appropriate and in the socalled parlour or front room was installed a piano because carrie said she would like to learn to play
she kept a servant and developed rapidly in household tactics and information
for the first time in her life she felt settled and somewhat justified in the eyes of society as she conceived of it
her thoughts were merry and innocent enough
for a long while she concerned herself over the arrangement of new york flats and wondered at ten families living in one building and all remaining strange and indifferent to each other
she also marvelled at the whistles of the hundreds of vessels in the harbourthe long low cries of the sound steamers and ferryboats when fog was on
the mere fact that these things spoke from the sea made them wonderful
she looked much at what she could see of the hudson from her west windows and of the great city building up rapidly on either hand
it was much to ponder over and sufficed to entertain her for more than a year without becoming stale
for another thing hurstwood was exceedingly interesting in his affection for her
troubled as he was he never exposed his difficulties to her
he carried himself with the same selfimportant air took his new state with easy familiarity and rejoiced in carries proclivities and successes
each evening he arrived promptly to dinner and found the little diningroom a most inviting spectacle
in a way the smallness of the room added to its luxury
it looked full and replete
the whitecovered table was arrayed with pretty dishes and lighted with a fourarmed candelabra each light of which was topped with a red shade
between carrie and the girl the steaks and chops came out all right and canned goods did the rest for a while
carrie studied the art of making biscuit and soon reached the stage where she could show a plate of light palatable morsels for her labour
in this manner the second third and fourth months passed
winter came and with it a feeling that indoors was best so that the attending of theatres was not much talked of
hurstwood made great efforts to meet all expenditures without a show of feeling one way or the other
he pretended that he was reinvesting his money in strengthening the business for greater ends in the future
he contented himself with a very moderate allowance of personal apparel and rarely suggested anything for carrie
thus the first winter passed
in the second year the business which hurstwood managed did increase somewhat
he got out of it regularly the per month which he had anticipated
unfortunately by this time carrie had reached certain conclusions and he had scraped up a few acquaintances
being of a passive and receptive rather than an active and aggressive nature carrie accepted the situation
her state seemed satisfactory enough
once in a while they would go to a theatre together occasionally in season to the beaches and different points about the city but they picked up no acquaintances
hurstwood naturally abandoned his show of fine manners with her and modified his attitude to one of easy familiarity
there were no misunderstandings no apparent differences of opinion
in fact without money or visiting friends he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy nor comment
carrie rather sympathised with his efforts and thought nothing upon her lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed in chicago
new york as a corporate entity and her flat temporarily seemed sufficient
however as hurstwoods business increased he as stated began to pick up acquaintances
he also began to allow himself more clothes
he convinced himself that his home life was very precious to him but allowed that he could occasionally stay away from dinner
the first time he did this he sent a message saying that he would be detained
carrie ate alone and wished that it might not happen again
the second time also he sent word but at the last moment
the third time he forgot entirely and explained afterwards
these events were months apart each
where were you george asked carrie after the first absence
tied up at the office he said genially
there were some accounts i had to straighten im sorry you couldnt get home she said kindly
i was fixing to have such a nice dinner the second time he gave a similar excuse but the third time the feeling about it in carries mind was a little bit out of the ordinary
i couldnt get home he said when he came in later in the evening i was so busy couldnt you have sent me word asked carrie
i meant to he said but you know i forgot it until it was too late to do any good and i had such a good dinner said carrie
now it so happened that from his observations of carrie he began to imagine that she was of the thoroughly domestic type of mind
he really thought after a year that her chief expression in life was finding its natural channel in household duties
notwithstanding the fact that he had observed her act in chicago and that during the past year he had only seen her limited in her relations to her flat and him by conditions which he made and that she had not gained any friends or associates he drew this peculiar conclusion
with it came a feeling of satisfaction in having a wife who could thus be content and this satisfaction worked its natural result
that is since he imagined he saw her satisfied he felt called upon to give only that which contributed to such satisfaction
he supplied the furniture the decorations the food and the necessary clothing
thoughts of entertaining her leading her out into the shine and show of life grew less and less
he felt attracted to the outer world but did not think she would care to go along
once he went to the theatre alone
another time he joined a couple of his new friends at an evening game of poker
since his moneyfeathers were beginning to grow again he felt like sprucing about
all this however in a much less imposing way than had been his wont in chicago
he avoided the gay places where he would be apt to meet those who had known him
now carrie began to feel this in various sensory ways
she was not the kind to be seriously disturbed by his actions
not loving him greatly she could not be jealous in a disturbing way
in fact she was not jealous at all
hurstwood was pleased with her placid manner when he should have duly considered it
when he did not come home it did not seem anything like a terrible thing to her
she gave him credit for having the usual allurements of menpeople to talk to places to stop friends to consult with
she was perfectly willing that he should enjoy himself in his way but she did not care to be neglected herself
her state still seemed fairly reasonable however
all she did observe was that hurstwood was somewhat different
some time in the second year of their residence in seventyeighth street the flat across the hall from carrie became vacant and into it moved a very handsome young woman and her husband with both of whom carrie afterwards became acquainted
this was brought about solely by the arrangement of the flats which were united in one place as it were by the dumbwaiter
this useful elevator by which fuel groceries and the like were sent up from the basement and garbage and waste sent down was used by both residents of one floor that is a small door opened into it from each flat
if the occupants of both flats answered to the whistle of the janitor at the same time they would stand face to face when they opened the dumbwaiter doors
one morning when carrie went to remove her paper the newcomer a handsome brunette of perhaps twentythree years of age was there for a like purpose
she was in a nightrobe and dressinggown with her hair very much tousled but she looked so pretty and goodnatured that carrie instantly conceived a liking for her
the newcomer did no more than smile shamefacedly but it was sufficient
carrie felt that she would like to know her and a similar feeling stirred in the mind of the other who admired carries innocent face
thats a real pretty woman who has moved in next door said carrie to hurstwood at the breakfast table
who are they asked hurstwood
i dont know said carrie
the name on the bell is vance
some one over there plays beautifully
i guess it must be she well you never can tell what sort of people youre living next to in this town can you said hurstwood expressing the customary new york opinion about neighbours
just think said carrie i have been in this house with nine other families for over a year and i dont know a soul
these people have been here over a month and i havent seen any one before this morning its just as well said hurstwood
you never know who youre going to get in with
some of these people are pretty bad company i expect so said carrie agreeably
the conversation turned to other things and carrie thought no more upon the subject until a day or two later when going out to market she encountered mrs vance coming in
the latter recognised her and nodded for which carrie returned a smile
this settled the probability of acquaintanceship
if there had been no faint recognition on this occasion there would have been no future association
carrie saw no more of mrs vance for several weeks but she heard her play through the thin walls which divided the front rooms of the flats and was pleased by the merry selection of pieces and the brilliance of their rendition
she could play only moderately herself and such variety as mrs vance exercised bordered for carrie upon the verge of great art
everything she had seen and heard thus farthe merest scraps and shadowsindicated that these people were in a measure refined and in comfortable circumstances
so carrie was ready for any extension of the friendship which might follow
one day carries bell rang and the servant who was in the kitchen pressed the button which caused the front door of the general entrance on the ground floor to be electrically unlatched
when carrie waited at her own door on the third floor to see who it might be coming up to call on her mrs vance appeared
i hope youll excuse me she said
i went out a while ago and forgot my outside key so i thought id ring your bell this was a common trick of other residents of the building whenever they had forgotten their outside keys
they did not apologise for it however
certainly said carrie
im glad you did
i do the same thing sometimes isnt it just delightful weather said mrs vance pausing for a moment
thus after a few more preliminaries this visiting acquaintance was well launched and in the young mrs vance carrie found an agreeable companion
on several occasions carrie visited her and was visited
both flats were good to look upon though that of the vances tended somewhat more to the luxurious
i want you to come over this evening and meet my husband said mrs vance not long after their intimacy began
he wants to meet you
you play cards dont you a little said carrie
well well have a game of cards
if your husband comes home bring him over hes not coming to dinner tonight said carrie
well when he does come well call him in carrie acquiesced and that evening met the portly vance an individual a few years younger than hurstwood and who owed his seemingly comfortable matrimonial state much more to his money than to his good looks
he thought well of carrie upon the first glance and laid himself out to be genial teaching her a new game of cards and talking to her about new york and its pleasures
mrs vance played some upon the piano and at last hurstwood came
i am very glad to meet you he said to mrs vance when carrie introduced him showing much of the old grace which had captivated carrie
did you think your wife had run away said mr vance extending his hand upon introduction
i didnt know but what she might have found a better husband said hurstwood
he now turned his attention to mrs vance and in a flash carrie saw again what she for some time had subconsciously missed in hurstwoodthe adroitness and flattery of which he was capable
she also saw that she was not well dressednot nearly as well dressedas mrs vance
these were not vague ideas any longer
her situation was cleared up for her
she felt that her life was becoming stale and therein she felt cause for gloom
the old helpful urging melancholy was restored
the desirous carrie was whispered to concerning her possibilities
there were no immediate results to this awakening for carrie had little power of initiative but nevertheless she seemed ever capable of getting herself into the tide of change where she would be easily borne along
hurstwood noticed nothing
he had been unconscious of the marked contrasts which carrie had observed
he did not even detect the shade of melancholy which settled in her eyes
worst of all she now began to feel the loneliness of the flat and seek the company of mrs vance who liked her exceedingly
lets go to the matine this afternoon said mrs vance who had stepped across into carries flat one morning still arrayed in a soft pink dressinggown which she had donned upon rising
hurstwood and vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hour before
all right said carrie noticing the air of the petted and wellgroomed woman in mrs vances general appearance
she looked as though she was dearly loved and her every wish gratified
what shall we see oh i do want to see nat goodwin said mrs vance
i do think he is the jolliest actor
the papers say this is such a good play what time will we have to start asked carrie
lets go at once and walk down broadway from thirtyfourth street said mrs vance
its such an interesting walk
hes at the madison square ill be glad to go said carrie
how much will we have to pay for seats not more than a dollar said mrs vance
the latter departed and at one oclock reappeared stunningly arrayed in a darkblue walking dress with a nobby hat to match
carrie had gotten herself up charmingly enough but this woman pained her by contrast
she seemed to have so many dainty little things which carrie had not
there were trinkets of gold an elegant green leather purse set with her initials a fancy handkerchief exceedingly rich in design and the like
carrie felt that she needed more and better clothes to compare with this woman and that any one looking at the two would pick mrs vance for her raiment alone
it was a trying though rather unjust thought for carrie had now developed an equally pleasing figure and had grown in comeliness until she was a thoroughly attractive type of her colour of beauty
there was some difference in the clothing of the two both of quality and age but this difference was not especially noticeable
it served however to augment carries dissatisfaction with her state
the walk down broadway then as now was one of the remarkable features of the city
there gathered before the matine and afterwards not only all the pretty women who love a showy parade but the men who love to gaze upon and admire them
it was a very imposing procession of pretty faces and fine clothes
women appeared in their very best hats shoes and gloves and walked arm in arm on their way to the fine shops or theatres strung along from fourteenth to thirtyfourth streets
equally the men paraded with the very latest they could afford
a tailor might have secured hints on suit measurements a shoemaker on proper lasts and colours a hatter on hats
it was literally true that if a lover of fine clothes secured a new suit it was sure to have its first airing on broadway
so true and well understood was this fact that several years later a popular song detailing this and other facts concerning the afternoon parade on matine days and entitled what right has he on broadway was published and had quite a vogue about the musichalls of the city
in all her stay in the city carrie had never heard of this showy parade had never even been on broadway when it was taking place
on the other hand it was a familiar thing to mrs vance who not only knew of it as an entity but had often been in it going purposely to see and be seen to create a stir with her beauty and dispel any tendency to fall short in dressiness by contrasting herself with the beauty and fashion of the town
carrie stepped along easily enough after they got out of the car at thirtyfourth street but soon fixed her eyes upon the lovely company which swarmed by and with them as they proceeded
she noticed suddenly that mrs vances manner had rather stiffened under the gaze of handsome men and elegantly dressed ladies whose glances were not modified by any rules of propriety
to stare seemed the proper and natural thing
carrie found herself stared at and ogled
men in flawless topcoats high hats and silverheaded walking sticks elbowed near and looked too often into conscious eyes
ladies rustled by in dresses of stiff cloth shedding affected smiles and perfume
carrie noticed among them the sprinkling of goodness and the heavy percentage of vice
the rouged and powdered cheeks and lips the scented hair the large misty and languorous eye were common enough
with a start she awoke to find that she was in fashions crowd on parade in a show placeand such a show place
jewellers windows gleamed along the path with remarkable frequency
florist shops furriers haberdashers confectionersall followed in rapid succession
the street was full of coaches
pompous doormen in immense coats shiny brass belts and buttons waited in front of expensive salesrooms
coachmen in tan boots white tights and blue jackets waited obsequiously for the mistresses of carriages who were shopping inside
the whole street bore the flavour of riches and show and carrie felt that she was not of it
she could not for the life of her assume the attitude and smartness of mrs vance who in her beauty was all assurance
she could only imagine that it must be evident to many that she was the less handsomely dressed of the two
it cut her to the quick and she resolved that she would not come here again until she looked better
at the same time she longed to feel the delight of parading here as an equal
ah then she would be happy
chapter xxxii
the feast of belshazzar a seer to translate such feelings as were generated in carrie by this walk put her in an exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed in the play
the actor whom they had gone to see had achieved his popularity by presenting a mellow type of comedy in which sufficient sorrow was introduced to lend contrast and relief to humour
for carrie as we well know the stage had a great attraction
she had never forgotten her one histrionic achievement in chicago
it dwelt in her mind and occupied her consciousness during many long afternoons in which her rockingchair and her latest novel contributed the only pleasures of her state
never could she witness a play without having her own ability vividly brought to consciousness
some scenes made her long to be a part of themto give expression to the feelings which she in the place of the character represented would feel
almost invariably she would carry the vivid imaginations away with her and brood over them the next day alone
she lived as much in these things as in the realities which made up her daily life
it was not often that she came to the play stirred to her hearts core by actualities
today a low song of longing had been set singing in her heart by the finery the merriment the beauty she had seen
oh these women who had passed her by hundreds and hundreds strong who were they
whence came the rich elegant dresses the astonishingly coloured buttons the knickknacks of silver and gold
where were these lovely creatures housed
amid what elegancies of carved furniture decorated walls elaborate tapestries did they move
where were their rich apartments loaded with all that money could provide
in what stables champed these sleek nervous horses and rested the gorgeous carriages
where lounged the richly groomed footmen
oh the mansions the lights the perfume the loaded boudoirs and tables
new york must be filled with such bowers or the beautiful insolent supercilious creatures could not be
some hothouses held them
it ached her to know that she was not one of themthat alas she had dreamed a dream and it had not come true
she wondered at her own solitude these two years pasther indifference to the fact that she had never achieved what she had expected
the play was one of those drawingroom concoctions in which charmingly overdressed ladies and gentlemen suffer the pangs of love and jealousy amid gilded surroundings
such bonmots are ever enticing to those who have all their days longed for such material surroundings and have never had them gratified
they have the charm of showing suffering under ideal conditions
who would not grieve upon a gilded chair
who would not suffer amid perfumed tapestries cushioned furniture and liveried servants
grief under such circumstances becomes an enticing thing
carrie longed to be of it
she wanted to take her sufferings whatever they were in such a world or failing that at least to simulate them under such charming conditions upon the stage
so affected was her mind by what she had seen that the play now seemed an extraordinarily beautiful thing
she was soon lost in the world it represented and wished that she might never return
between the acts she studied the galaxy of matine attendants in front rows and boxes and conceived a new idea of the possibilities of new york
she was sure she had not seen it allthat the city was one whirl of pleasure and delight
going out the same broadway taught her a sharper lesson
the scene she had witnessed coming down was now augmented and at its height
such a crush of finery and folly she had never seen
it clinched her convictions concerning her state
she had not lived could not lay claim to having lived until something of this had come into her own life
women were spending money like water she could see that in every elegant shop she passed
flowers candy jewelry seemed the principal things in which the elegant dames were interested
and sheshe had scarcely enough pin money to indulge in such outings as this a few times a month
that night the pretty little flat seemed a commonplace thing
it was not what the rest of the world was enjoying
she saw the servant working at dinner with an indifferent eye
in her mind were running scenes of the play
particularly she remembered one beautiful actressthe sweetheart who had been wooed and won
the grace of this woman had won carries heart
her dresses had been all that art could suggest her sufferings had been so real
the anguish which she had portrayed carrie could feel
it was done as she was sure she could do it
there were places in which she could even do better
hence she repeated the lines to herself
oh if she could only have such a part how broad would be her life
she too could act appealingly
when hurstwood came carrie was moody
she was sitting rocking and thinking and did not care to have her enticing imaginations broken in upon so she said little or nothing
whats the matter carrie said hurstwood after a time noticing her quiet almost moody state
nothing said carrie
i dont feel very well tonight not sick are you he asked approaching very close
oh no she said almost pettishly i just dont feel very good thats too bad he said stepping away and adjusting his vest after his slight bending over
i was thinking we might go to a show tonight i dont want to go said carrie annoyed that her fine visions should have thus been broken into and driven out of her mind
ive been to the matine this afternoon oh you have said hurstwood
what was it a gold mine how was it pretty good said carrie
and you dont want to go again tonight i dont think i do she said
nevertheless wakened out of her melancholia and called to the dinner table she changed her mind
a little food in the stomach does wonders
she went again and in so doing temporarily recovered her equanimity
the great awakening blow had however been delivered
as often as she might recover from these discontented thoughts now they would occur again
time and repetitionah the wonder of it
the dropping water and the solid stonehow utterly it yields at last
not long after this matine experienceperhaps a monthmrs
vance invited carrie to an evening at the theatre with them
she heard carrie say that hurstwood was not coming home to dinner
why dont you come with us
dont get dinner for yourself
were going down to sherrys for dinner and then over to the lyceum
come along with us i think i will answered carrie
she began to dress at three oclock for her departure at halfpast five for the noted diningroom which was then crowding delmonicos for position in society
in this dressing carrie showed the influence of her association with the dashing mrs vance
she had constantly had her attention called by the latter to novelties in everything which pertains to a womans apparel
are you going to get such and such a hat or have you seen the new gloves with the oval pearl buttons were but sample phrases out of a large selection
the next time you get a pair of shoes dearie said mrs vance get button with thick soles and patentleather tips
theyre all the rage this fall i will said carrie
oh dear have you seen the new shirtwaists at altmans
they have some of the loveliest patterns
i saw one there that i know would look stunning on you
i said so when i saw it carrie listened to these things with considerable interest for they were suggested with more of friendliness than is usually common between pretty women
mrs vance liked carries stable goodnature so well that she really took pleasure in suggesting to her the latest things
why dont you get yourself one of those nice serge skirts theyre selling at lord taylors she said one day
theyre the circular style and theyre going to be worn from now on
a dark blue one would look so nice on you carrie listened with eager ears
these things never came up between her and hurstwood
nevertheless she began to suggest one thing and another which hurstwood agreed to without any expression of opinion
he noticed the new tendency on carries part and finally hearing much of mrs vance and her delightful ways suspected whence the change came
he was not inclined to offer the slightest objection so soon but he felt that carries wants were expanding
this did not appeal to him exactly but he cared for her in his own way and so the thing stood
still there was something in the details of the transactions which caused carrie to feel that her requests were not a delight to him
he did not enthuse over the purchases
this led her to believe that neglect was creeping in and so another small wedge was entered
nevertheless one of the results of mrs vances suggestions was the fact that on this occasion carrie was dressed somewhat to her own satisfaction
she had on her best but there was comfort in the thought that if she must confine herself to a best it was neat and fitting
she looked the wellgroomed woman of twentyone and mrs vance praised her which brought colour to her plump cheeks and a noticeable brightness into her large eyes
it was threatening rain and mr vance at his wifes request had called a coach
your husband isnt coming suggested mr vance as he met carrie in his little parlour
no he said he wouldnt be home for dinner better leave a little note for him telling him where we are
he might turn up i will said carrie who had not thought of it before
tell him well be at sherrys until eight oclock
he knows though i guess carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts and scrawled the note gloves on
when she returned a newcomer was in the vance flat
mrs
wheeler let me introduce mr ames a cousin of mine said mrs vance
hes going along with us arent you bob im very glad to meet you said ames bowing politely to carrie
the latter caught in a glance the dimensions of a very stalwart figure
she also noticed that he was smoothshaven good looking and young but nothing more
mr
ames is just down in new york for a few days put in vance and were trying to show him around a little oh are you said carrie taking another glance at the newcomer
yes i am just on here from indianapolis for a week or so said young ames seating himself on the edge of a chair to wait while mrs vance completed the last touches of her toilet
i guess you find new york quite a thing to see dont you said carrie venturing something to avoid a possible deadly silence
it is rather large to get around in a week answered ames pleasantly
he was an exceedingly genial soul this young man and wholly free of affectation
it seemed to carrie he was as yet only overcoming the last traces of the bashfulness of youth
he did not seem apt at conversation but he had the merit of being well dressed and wholly courageous
carrie felt as if it were not going to be hard to talk to him
well i guess were ready now
the coach is outside come on people said mrs vance coming in smiling
bob youll have to look after mrs wheeler ill try to said bob smiling and edging closer to carrie
you wont need much watching will you he volunteered in a sort of ingratiating and helpmeout kind of way
not very i hope said carrie
they descended the stairs mrs vance offering suggestions and climbed into the open coach
all right said vance slamming the coach door and the conveyance rolled away
what is it were going to see asked ames
sothern said vance in lord chumley oh he is so good said mrs vance
hes just the funniest man i notice the papers praise it said ames
i havent any doubt put in vance but well all enjoy it very much ames had taken a seat beside carrie and accordingly he felt it his bounden duty to pay her some attention
he was interested to find her so young a wife and so pretty though it was only a respectful interest
there was nothing of the dashing ladys man about him
he had respect for the married state and thought only of some pretty marriageable girls in indianapolis
are you a born new yorker asked ames of carrie
oh no ive only been here for two years oh well youve had time to see a great deal of it anyhow i dont seem to have answered carrie
its about as strange to me as when i first came here youre not from the west are you yes
im from wisconsin she answered
well it does seem as if most people in this town havent been here so very long
i hear of lots of indiana people in my line who are here what is your line asked carrie
im connected with an electrical company said the youth
carrie followed up this desultory conversation with occasional interruptions from the vances
several times it became general and partially humorous and in that manner the restaurant was reached
carrie had noticed the appearance of gayety and pleasureseeking in the streets which they were following
coaches were numerous pedestrians many and in fiftyninth street the street cars were crowded
at fiftyninth street and fifth avenue a blaze of lights from several new hotels which bordered the plaza square gave a suggestion of sumptuous hotel life
fifth avenue the home of the wealthy was noticeably crowded with carriages and gentlemen in evening dress
at sherrys an imposing doorman opened the coach door and helped them out
young ames held carries elbow as he helped her up the steps
they entered the lobby already swarming with patrons and then after divesting themselves of their wraps went into a sumptuous diningroom
in all carries experience she had never seen anything like this
in the whole time she had been in new york hurstwoods modified state had not permitted his bringing her to such a place
there was an almost indescribable atmosphere about it which convinced the newcomer that this was the proper thing
here was the place where the matter of expense limited the patrons to the moneyed or pleasureloving class
carrie had read of it often in the morning and evening world she had seen notices of dances parties balls and suppers at sherrys
the misses soandso would give a party on wednesday evening at sherrys
young mr soandso would entertain a party of friends at a private luncheon on the sixteenth at sherrys
the common run of conventional perfunctory notices of the doings of society which she could scarcely refrain from scanning each day had given her a distinct idea of the gorgeousness and luxury of this wonderful temple of gastronomy
now at last she was really in it
she had come up the imposing steps guarded by the large and portly doorman
she had seen the lobby guarded by another large and portly gentleman and been waited upon by uniformed youths who took care of canes overcoats and the like
here was the splendid diningchamber all decorated and aglow where the wealthy ate
ah how fortunate was mrs vance young beautiful and well offat least sufficiently so to come here in a coach
what a wonderful thing it was to be rich
vance led the way through lanes of shining tables at which were seated parties of two three four five or six
the air of assurance and dignity about it all was exceedingly noticeable to the novitiate
incandescent lights the reflection of their glow in polished glasses and the shine of gilt upon the walls combined into one tone of light which it requires minutes of complacent observation to separate and take particular note of
the white shirt fronts of the gentlemen the bright costumes of the ladies diamonds jewels fine feathersall were exceedingly noticeable
carrie walked with an air equal to that of mrs vance and accepted the seat which the head waiter provided for her
she was keenly aware of all the little things that were donethe little genuflections and attentions of the waiters and head waiter which americans pay for
the air with which the latter pulled out each chair and the wave of the hand with which he motioned them to be seated were worth several dollars in themselves
once seated there began that exhibition of showy wasteful and unwholesome gastronomy as practised by wealthy americans which is the wonder and astonishment of true culture and dignity the world over
the large bill of fare held an array of dishes sufficient to feed an army sidelined with prices which made reasonable expenditure a ridiculous impossibilityan order of soup at fifty cents or a dollar with a dozen kinds to choose from oysters in forty styles and at sixty cents the halfdozen entres fish and meats at prices which would house one over night in an average hotel
one dollar fifty and two dollars seemed to be the most common figures upon this most tastefully printed bill of fare
carrie noticed this and in scanning it the price of spring chicken carried her back to that other bill of fare and far different occasion when for the first time she sat with drouet in a good restaurant in chicago
it was only momentarya sad note as out of an old songand then it was gone
but in that flash was seen the other carriepoor hungry drifting at her wits ends and all chicago a cold and closed world from which she only wandered because she could not find work
on the walls were designs in colour square spots of robinsegg blue set in ornate frames of gilt whose corners were elaborate mouldings of fruit and flowers with fat cupids hovering in angelic comfort
on the ceilings were coloured traceries with more gilt leading to a centre where spread a cluster of lightsincandescent globes mingled with glittering prisms and stucco tendrils of gilt
the floor was of a reddish hue waxed and polished and in every direction were mirrorstall brilliant beveledged mirrorsreflecting and rereflecting forms faces and candelabra a score and a hundred times
the tables were not so remarkable in themselves and yet the imprint of sherry upon the napery the name of tiffany upon the silverware the name of haviland upon the china and over all the glow of the small redshaded candelabra and the reflected tints of the walls on garments and faces made them seem remarkable
each waiter added an air of exclusiveness and elegance by the manner in which he bowed scraped touched and trifled with things
the exclusively personal attention which he devoted to each one standing half bent ear to one side elbows akimbo saying soupgreen turtle yes
one portion yes
oysterscertainlyhalfdozenyes
asparagus
olivesyes it would be the same with each one only vance essayed to order for all inviting counsel and suggestions
carrie studied the company with open eyes
so this was high life in new york
it was so that the rich spent their days and evenings
her poor little mind could not rise above applying each scene to all society
every fine lady must be in the crowd on broadway in the afternoon in the theatre at the matine in the coaches and dininghalls at night
it must be glow and shine everywhere with coaches waiting and footmen attending and she was out of it all
in two long years she had never even been in such a place as this
vance was in his element here as hurstwood would have been in former days
he ordered freely of soup oysters roast meats and side dishes and had several bottles of wine brought which were set down beside the table in a wicker basket
ames was looking away rather abstractedly at the crowd and showed an interesting profile to carrie
his forehead was high his nose rather large and strong his chin moderately pleasing
he had a good wide wellshaped mouth and his darkbrown hair was parted slightly on one side
he seemed to have the least touch of boyishness to carrie and yet he was a man full grown
do you know he said turning back to carrie after his reflection i sometimes think it is a shame for people to spend so much money this way carrie looked at him a moment with the faintest touch of surprise at his seriousness
he seemed to be thinking about something over which she had never pondered
do you she answered interestedly
yes he said they pay so much more than these things are worth
they put on so much show i dont know why people shouldnt spend when they have it said mrs vance
it doesnt do any harm said vance who was still studying the bill of fare though he had ordered
ames was looking away again and carrie was again looking at his forehead
to her he seemed to be thinking about strange things
as he studied the crowd his eye was mild
look at that womans dress over there he said again turning to carrie and nodding in a direction
where said carrie following his eyes
over there in the cornerway over
do you see that brooch isnt it large said carrie
one of the largest clusters of jewels i have ever seen said ames
it is isnt it said carrie
she felt as if she would like to be agreeable to this young man and also there came with it or perhaps preceded it the slightest shade of a feeling that he was better educated than she wasthat his mind was better
he seemed to look it and the saving grace in carrie was that she could understand that people could be wiser
she had seen a number of people in her life who reminded her of what she had vaguely come to think of as scholars
this strong young man beside her with his clear natural look seemed to get a hold of things which she did not quite understand but approved of
it was fine to be so as a man she thought
the conversation changed to a book that was having its vogue at the timemoulding a maiden by albert ross
mrs vance had read it
vance had seen it discussed in some of the papers
a man can make quite a strike writing a book said vance
i notice this fellow ross is very much talked about he was looking at carrie as he spoke
i hadnt heard of him said carrie honestly
oh i have said mrs vance
hes written lots of things
this last story is pretty good he doesnt amount to much said ames
carrie turned her eyes toward him as to an oracle
his stuff is nearly as bad as dora thorne concluded ames
carrie felt this as a personal reproof
she read dora thorne or had a great deal in the past
it seemed only fair to her but she supposed that people thought it very fine
now this cleareyed fineheaded youth who looked something like a student to her made fun of it
it was poor to him not worth reading
she looked down and for the first time felt the pain of not understanding
yet there was nothing sarcastic or supercilious in the way ames spoke
he had very little of that in him
carrie felt that it was just kindly thought of a high orderthe right thing to think and wondered what else was right according to him
he seemed to notice that she listened and rather sympathised with him and from now on he talked mostly to her
as the waiter bowed and scraped about felt the dishes to see if they were hot enough brought spoons and forks and did all those little attentive things calculated to impress the luxury of the situation upon the diner ames also leaned slightly to one side and told her of indianapolis in an intelligent way
he really had a very bright mind which was finding its chief development in electrical knowledge
his sympathies for other forms of information however and for types of people were quick and warm
the red glow on his head gave it a sandy tinge and put a bright glint in his eye
carrie noticed all these things as he leaned toward her and felt exceedingly young
this man was far ahead of her
he seemed wiser than hurstwood saner and brighter than drouet
he seemed innocent and clean and she thought that he was exceedingly pleasant
she noticed also that his interest in her was a faroff one
she was not in his life nor any of the things that touched his life and yet now as he spoke of these things they appealed to her
i shouldnt care to be rich he told her as the dinner proceeded and the supply of food warmed up his sympathies not rich enough to spend my money this way oh wouldnt you said carrie the to her new attitude forcing itself distinctly upon her for the first time
no he said
what good would it do
a man doesnt need this sort of thing to be happy carrie thought of this doubtfully but coming from him it had weight with her
he probably could be happy she thought to herself all alone
hes so strong mr and mrs vance kept up a running fire of interruptions and these impressive things by ames came at odd moments
they were sufficient however for the atmosphere that went with this youth impressed itself upon carrie without words
there was something in him or the world he moved in which appealed to her
he reminded her of scenes she had seen on the stagethe sorrows and sacrifices that always went with she knew not what
he had taken away some of the bitterness of the contrast between this life and her life and all by a certain calm indifference which concerned only him
as they went out he took her arm and helped her into the coach and then they were off again and so to the show
during the acts carrie found herself listening to him very attentively
he mentioned things in the play which she most approved ofthings which swayed her deeply
dont you think it rather fine to be an actor she asked once
yes i do he said to be a good one
i think the theatre a great thing just this little approval set carries heart bounding
ah if she could only be an actressa good one
this man was wisehe knewand he approved of it
if she were a fine actress such men as he would approve of her
she felt that he was good to speak as he had although it did not concern her at all
she did not know why she felt this way
at the close of the show it suddenly developed that he was not going back with them
oh arent you said carrie with an unwarrantable feeling
oh no he said im stopping right around here in thirtythird street carrie could not say anything else but somehow this development shocked her
she had been regretting the wane of a pleasant evening but she had thought there was a halfhour more
oh the halfhours the minutes of the world what miseries and griefs are crowded into them
she said goodbye with feigned indifference
what matter could it make
still the coach seemed lorn
when she went into her own flat she had this to think about
she did not know whether she would ever see this man any more
what difference could it makewhat difference could it make
hurstwood had returned and was already in bed
his clothes were scattered loosely about
carrie came to the door and saw him then retreated
she did not want to go in yet a while
she wanted to think
it was disagreeable to her
back in the diningroom she sat in her chair and rocked
her little hands were folded tightly as she thought
through a fog of longing and conflicting desires she was beginning to see
oh ye legions of hope and pityof sorrow and pain
she was rocking and beginning to see
chapter xxxiii
without the walled city the slope of the years the immediate result of this was nothing
results from such things are usually long in growing
morning brings a change of feeling
the existent condition invariably pleads for itself
it is only at odd moments that we get glimpses of the misery of things
the heart understands when it is confronted with contrasts
take them away and the ache subsides
carrie went on leading much this same life for six months thereafter or more
she did not see ames any more
he called once upon the vances but she only heard about it through the young wife
then he went west and there was a gradual subsidence of whatever personal attraction had existed
the mental effect of the thing had not gone however and never would entirely
she had an ideal to contrast men byparticularly men close to her
during all this timea period rapidly approaching three yearshurstwood had been moving along in an even path
there was no apparent slope downward and distinctly none upward so far as the casual observer might have seen
but psychologically there was a change which was marked enough to suggest the future very distinctly indeed
this was in the mere matter of the halt his career had received when he departed from chicago
a mans fortune or material progress is very much the same as his bodily growth
either he is growing stronger healthier wiser as the youth approaching manhood or he is growing weaker older less incisive mentally as the man approaching old age
there are no other states
frequently there is a period between the cessation of youthful accretion and the setting in in the case of the middleaged man of the tendency toward decay when the two processes are almost perfectly balanced and there is little doing in either direction
given time enough however the balance becomes a sagging to the grave side
slowly at first then with a modest momentum and at last the graveward process is in the full swing
so it is frequently with mans fortune
if its process of accretion is never halted if the balancing stage is never reached there will be no toppling
rich men are frequently in these days saved from this dissolution of their fortune by their ability to hire younger brains
these younger brains look upon the interests of the fortune as their own and so steady and direct its progress
if each individual were left absolutely to the care of his own interests and were given time enough in which to grow exceedingly old his fortune would pass as his strength and will
he and his would be utterly dissolved and scattered unto the four winds of the heavens
but now see wherein the parallel changes
a fortune like a man is an organism which draws to itself other minds and other strength than that inherent in the founder
beside the young minds drawn to it by salaries it becomes allied with young forces which make for its existence even when the strength and wisdom of the founder are fading
it may be conserved by the growth of a community or of a state
it may be involved in providing something for which there is a growing demand
this removes it at once beyond the special care of the founder
it needs not so much foresight now as direction
the man wanes the need continues or grows and the fortune fallen into whose hands it may continues
hence some men never recognise the turning in the tide of their abilities
it is only in chance cases where a fortune or a state of success is wrested from them that the lack of ability to do as they did formerly becomes apparent
hurstwood set down under new conditions was in a position to see that he was no longer young
if he did not it was due wholly to the fact that his state was so well balanced that an absolute change for the worse did not show
not trained to reason or introspect himself he could not analyse the change that was taking place in his mind and hence his body but he felt the depression of it
constant comparison between his old state and his new showed a balance for the worse which produced a constant state of gloom or at least depression
now it has been shown experimentally that a constantly subdued frame of mind produces certain poisons in the blood called katastates just as virtuous feelings of pleasure and delight produce helpful chemicals called anastates
the poisons generated by remorse inveigh against the system and eventually produce marked physical deterioration
to these hurstwood was subject
in the course of time it told upon his temper
his eye no longer possessed that buoyant searching shrewdness which had characterised it in adams street
his step was not as sharp and firm
he was given to thinking thinking thinking
the new friends he made were not celebrities
they were of a cheaper a slightly more sensual and cruder grade
he could not possibly take the pleasure in this company that he had in that of those fine frequenters of the chicago resort
he was left to brood
slowly exceedingly slowly his desire to greet conciliate and make at home these people who visited the warren street place passed from him
more and more slowly the significance of the realm he had left began to be clear
it did not seem so wonderful to be in it when he was in it
it had seemed very easy for any one to get up there and have ample raiment and money to spend but now that he was out of it how far off it became
he began to see as one sees a city with a wall about it
men were posted at the gates
you could not get in
those inside did not care to come out to see who you were
they were so merry inside there that all those outside were forgotten and he was on the outside
each day he could read in the evening papers of the doings within this walled city
in the notices of passengers for europe he read the names of eminent frequenters of his old resort
in the theatrical column appeared from time to time announcements of the latest successes of men he had known
he knew that they were at their old gayeties
pullmans were hauling them to and fro about the land papers were greeting them with interesting mentions the elegant lobbies of hotels and the glow of polished diningrooms were keeping them close within the walled city
men whom he had known men whom he had tipped glasses withrich men and he was forgotten
who was mr wheeler
what was the warren street resort
bah
if one thinks that such thoughts do not come to so common a type of mindthat such feelings require a higher mental developmenti would urge for their consideration the fact that it is the higher mental development that does away with such thoughts
it is the higher mental development which induces philosophy and that fortitude which refuses to dwell upon such thingsrefuses to be made to suffer by their consideration
the common type of mind is exceedingly keen on all matters which relate to its physical welfareexceedingly keen
it is the unintellectual miser who sweats blood at the loss of a hundred dollars
it is the epictetus who smiles when the last vestige of physical welfare is removed
the time came in the third year when this thinking began to produce results in the warren street place
the tide of patronage dropped a little below what it had been at its best since he had been there
this irritated and worried him
there came a night when he confessed to carrie that the business was not doing as well this month as it had the month before
this was in lieu of certain suggestions she had made concerning little things she wanted to buy
she had not failed to notice that he did not seem to consult her about buying clothes for himself
for the first time it struck her as a ruse or that he said it so that she would not think of asking for things
her reply was mild enough but her thoughts were rebellious
he was not looking after her at all
she was depending for her enjoyment upon the vances
and now the latter announced that they were going away
it was approaching spring and they were going north
oh yes said mrs vance to carrie we think we might as well give up the flat and store our things
well be gone for the summer and it would be a useless expense
i think well settle a little farther down town when we come back carrie heard this with genuine sorrow
she had enjoyed mrs vances companionship so much
there was no one else in the house whom she knew
again she would be all alone
hurstwoods gloom over the slight decrease in profits and the departure of the vances came together
so carrie had loneliness and this mood of her husband to enjoy at the same time
it was a grievous thing
she became restless and dissatisfied not exactly as she thought with hurstwood but with life
what was it
a very dull round indeed
what did she have
nothing but this narrow little flat
the vances could travel they could do the things worth doing and here she was
for what was she made anyhow
more thought followed and then tearstears seemed justified and the only relief in the world
for another period this state continued the twain leading a rather monotonous life and then there was a slight change for the worse
one evening hurstwood after thinking about a way to modify carries desire for clothes and the general strain upon his ability to provide said i dont think ill ever be able to do much with shaughnessy whats the matter said carrie
oh hes a slow greedy mick
he wont agree to anything to improve the place and it wont ever pay without it cant you make him said carrie
no ive tried
the only thing i can see if i want to improve is to get hold of a place of my own why dont you said carrie
well all i have is tied up in there just now
if i had a chance to save a while i think i could open a place that would give us plenty of money cant we save said carrie
we might try it he suggested
ive been thinking that if wed take a smaller flat down town and live economically for a year i would have enough with what i have invested to open a good place
then we could arrange to live as you want to it would suit me all right said carrie who nevertheless felt badly to think it had come to this
talk of a smaller flat sounded like poverty
there are lots of nice little flats down around sixth avenue below fourteenth street
we might get one down there ill look at them if you say so said carrie
i think i could break away from this fellow inside of a year said hurstwood
nothing will ever come of this arrangement as its going on now ill look around said carrie observing that the proposed change seemed to be a serious thing with him
the upshot of this was that the change was eventually effected not without great gloom on the part of carrie
it really affected her more seriously than anything that had yet happened
she began to look upon hurstwood wholly as a man and not as a lover or husband
she felt thoroughly bound to him as a wife and that her lot was cast with his whatever it might be but she began to see that he was gloomy and taciturn not a young strong and buoyant man
he looked a little bit old to her about the eyes and mouth now and there were other things which placed him in his true rank so far as her estimation was concerned
she began to feel that she had made a mistake
incidentally she also began to recall the fact that he had practically forced her to flee with him
the new flat was located in thirteenth street a half block west of sixth avenue and contained only four rooms
the new neighbourhood did not appeal to carrie as much
there were no trees here no west view of the river
the street was solidly built up
there were twelve families here respectable enough but nothing like the vances
richer people required more space
being left alone in this little place carrie did without a girl
she made it charming enough but could not make it delight her
hurstwood was not inwardly pleased to think that they should have to modify their state but he argued that he could do nothing
he must put the best face on it and let it go at that
he tried to show carrie that there was no cause for financial alarm but only congratulation over the chance he would have at the end of the year by taking her rather more frequently to the theatre and by providing a liberal table
this was for the time only
he was getting in the frame of mind where he wanted principally to be alone and to be allowed to think
the disease of brooding was beginning to claim him as a victim
only the newspapers and his own thoughts were worth while
the delight of love had again slipped away
it was a case of live now making the best you can out of a very commonplace station in life
the road downward has but few landings and level places
the very state of his mind superinduced by his condition caused the breach to widen between him and his partner
at last that individual began to wish that hurstwood was out of it
it so happened however that a real estate deal on the part of the owner of the land arranged things even more effectually than illwill could have schemed
did you see that said shaughnessy one morning to hurstwood pointing to the real estate column in a copy of the herald which he held
no what is it said hurstwood looking down the items of news
the man who owns this ground has sold it you dont say so said hurstwood
he looked and there was the notice
mr august viele had yesterday registered the transfer of the lot x feet at the corner of warren and hudson streets to j f slawson for the sum of
our lease expires when asked hurstwood thinking
next february isnt it thats right said shaughnessy
it doesnt say what the new mans going to do with it remarked hurstwood looking back to the paper
well hear i guess soon enough said shaughnessy
sure enough it did develop
mr slawson owned the property adjoining and was going to put up a modern office building
the present one was to be torn down
it would take probably a year and a half to complete the other one
all these things developed by degrees and hurstwood began to ponder over what would become of the saloon
one day he spoke about it to his partner
do you think it would be worth while to open up somewhere else in the neighbourhood what would be the use said shaughnessy
we couldnt get another corner around here it wouldnt pay anywhere else do you think i wouldnt try it said the other
the approaching change now took on a most serious aspect to hurstwood
dissolution meant the loss of his thousand dollars and he could not save another thousand in the time
he understood that shaughnessy was merely tired of the arrangement and would probably lease the new corner when completed alone
he began to worry about the necessity of a new connection and to see impending serious financial straits unless something turned up
this left him in no mood to enjoy his flat or carrie and consequently the depression invaded that quarter
meanwhile he took such time as he could to look about but opportunities were not numerous
more he had not the same impressive personality which he had when he first came to new york
bad thoughts had put a shade into his eyes which did not impress others favourably
neither had he thirteen hundred dollars in hand to talk with
about a month later finding that he had not made any progress shaughnessy reported definitely that slawson would not extend the lease
i guess this things got to come to an end he said affecting an air of concern
well if it has it has answered hurstwood grimly
he would not give the other a key to his opinions whatever they were
he should not have the satisfaction
a day or two later he saw that he must say something to carrie
you know he said i think im going to get the worst of my deal down there how is that asked carrie in astonishment
well the man who owns the ground has sold it and the new owner wont release it to us
the business may come to an end cant you start somewhere else there doesnt seem to be any place
shaughnessy doesnt want to do you lose what you put in yes said hurstwood whose face was a study
oh isnt that too bad said carrie
its a trick said hurstwood
thats all
theyll start another place there all right carrie looked at him and gathered from his whole demeanour what it meant
it was serious very serious
do you think you can get something else she ventured timidly
hurstwood thought a while
it was all up with the bluff about money and investment
she could see now that he was broke i dont know he said solemnly i can try chapter xxxiv
the grind of the millstones a sample of chaff carrie pondered over this situation as consistently as hurstwood once she got the facts adjusted in her mind
it took several days for her to fully realise that the approach of the dissolution of her husbands business meant commonplace struggle and privation
her mind went back to her early venture in chicago the hansons and their flat and her heart revolted
that was terrible
everything about poverty was terrible
she wished she knew a way out
her recent experiences with the vances had wholly unfitted her to view her own state with complacence
the glamour of the high life of the city had in the few experiences afforded her by the former seized her completely
she had been taught how to dress and where to go without having ample means to do either
now these thingseverpresent realities as they werefilled her eyes and mind
the more circumscribed became her state the more entrancing seemed this other
and now poverty threatened to seize her entirely and to remove this other world far upward like a heaven to which any lazarus might extend appealingly his hands
so too the ideal brought into her life by ames remained
he had gone but here was his word that riches were not everything that there was a great deal more in the world than she knew that the stage was good and the literature she read poor
he was a strong man and cleanhow much stronger and better than hurstwood and drouet she only half formulated to herself but the difference was painful
it was something to which she voluntarily closed her eyes
during the last three months of the warren street connection hurstwood took parts of days off and hunted tracking the business advertisements
it was a more or less depressing business wholly because of the thought that he must soon get something or he would begin to live on the few hundred dollars he was saving and then he would have nothing to investhe would have to hire out as a clerk
everything he discovered in his line advertised as an opportunity was either too expensive or too wretched for him
besides winter was coming the papers were announcing hardships and there was a general feeling of hard times in the air or at least he thought so
in his worry other peoples worries became apparent
no item about a firm failing a family starving or a man dying upon the streets supposedly of starvation but arrested his eye as he scanned the morning papers
once the world came out with a flaring announcement about people out of employment in new york this winter which struck as a knife at his heart
eighty thousand he thought
what an awful thing that is this was new reasoning for hurstwood
in the old days the world had seemed to be getting along well enough
he had been wont to see similar things in the daily news in chicago but they did not hold his attention
now these things were like grey clouds hovering along the horizon of a clear day
they threatened to cover and obscure his life with chilly greyness
he tried to shake them off to forget and brace up
sometimes he said to himself mentally whats the use worrying
im not out yet
ive got six weeks more
even if worst comes to worst ive got enough to live on for six months curiously as he troubled over his future his thoughts occasionally reverted to his wife and family
he had avoided such thoughts for the first three years as much as possible
he hated her and he could get along without her
let her go
he would do well enough
now however when he was not doing well enough he began to wonder what she was doing how his children were getting along
he could see them living as nicely as ever occupying the comfortable house and using his property
by george
its a shame they should have it all he vaguely thought to himself on several occasions
i didnt do anything as he looked back now and analysed the situation which led up to his taking the money he began mildly to justify himself
what had he donewhat in the worldthat should bar him out this way and heap such difficulties upon him
it seemed only yesterday to him since he was comfortable and welltodo
but now it was all wrested from him
she didnt deserve what she got out of me that is sure
i didnt do so much if everybody could just know there was no thought that the facts ought to be advertised
it was only a mental justification he was seeking from himselfsomething that would enable him to bear his state as a righteous man
one afternoon five weeks before the warren street place closed up he left the saloon to visit three or four places he saw advertised in the herald one was down in gold street and he visited that but did not enter
it was such a cheap looking place he felt that he could not abide it
another was on the bowery which he knew contained many showy resorts
it was near grand street and turned out to be very handsomely fitted up
he talked around about investments for fully threequarters of an hour with the proprietor who maintained that his health was poor and that was the reason he wished a partner
well now just how much money would it take to buy a half interest here said hurstwood who saw seven hundred dollars as his limit
three thousand said the man
hurstwoods jaw fell
cash he said
cash he tried to put on an air of deliberation as one who might really buy but his eyes showed gloom
he wound up by saying he would think it over and came away
the man he had been talking to sensed his condition in a vague way
i dont think he wants to buy he said to himself
he doesnt talk right the afternoon was as grey as lead and cold
it was blowing up a disagreeable winter wind
he visited a place far up on the east side near sixtyninth street and it was five oclock and growing dim when he reached there
a portly german kept this place
how about this ad of yours asked hurstwood who rather objected to the looks of the place
oh dat iss all over said the german
i vill not sell now oh is that so yes dere is nothing to dat
it iss all over very well said hurstwood turning around
the german paid no more attention to him and it made him angry
the crazy ass he said to himself
what does he want to advertise for wholly depressed he started for thirteenth street
the flat had only a light in the kitchen where carrie was working
he struck a match and lighting the gas sat down in the diningroom without even greeting her
she came to the door and looked in
its you is it she said and went back
yes he said without even looking up from the evening paper he had bought
carrie saw things were wrong with him
he was not so handsome when gloomy
the lines at the sides of the eyes were deepened
naturally dark of skin gloom made him look slightly sinister
he was quite a disagreeable figure
carrie set the table and brought in the meal
dinners ready she said passing him for something
he did not answer reading on
she came in and sat down at her place feeling exceedingly wretched
wont you eat now she asked
he folded his paper and drew near silence holding for a time except for the pass mes its been gloomy today hasnt it ventured carrie after a time
yes he said
he only picked at his food
are you still sure to close up said carrie venturing to take up the subject which they had discussed often enough
of course we are he said with the slightest modification of sharpness
this retort angered carrie
she had had a dreary day of it herself
you neednt talk like that she said
oh he exclaimed pushing back from the table as if to say more but letting it go at that
then he picked up his paper
carrie left her seat containing herself with difficulty
he saw she was hurt
dont go way he said as she started back into the kitchen
eat your dinner she passed not answering
he looked at the paper a few moments and then rose up and put on his coat
im going downtown carrie he said coming out
im out of sorts tonight she did not answer
dont be angry he said
it will be all right tomorrow he looked at her but she paid no attention to him working at her dishes
goodbye he said finally and went out
this was the first strong result of the situation between them but with the nearing of the last day of the business the gloom became almost a permanent thing
hurstwood could not conceal his feelings about the matter
carrie could not help wondering where she was drifting
it got so that they talked even less than usual and yet it was not hurstwood who felt any objection to carrie
it was carrie who shied away from him
this he noticed
it aroused an objection to her becoming indifferent to him
he made the possibility of friendly intercourse almost a giant task and then noticed with discontent that carrie added to it by her manner and made it more impossible
at last the final day came
when it actually arrived hurstwood who had got his mind into such a state where a thunderclap and raging storm would have seemed highly appropriate was rather relieved to find that it was a plain ordinary day
the sun shone the temperature was pleasant
he felt as he came to the breakfast table that it wasnt so terrible after all
well he said to carrie todays my last day on earth carrie smiled in answer to his humour
hurstwood glanced over his paper rather gayly
he seemed to have lost a load
ill go down for a little while he said after breakfast and then ill look around
tomorrow ill spend the whole day looking about
i think i can get something now this things off my hands he went out smiling and visited the place
shaughnessy was there
they had made all arrangements to share according to their interests
when however he had been there several hours gone out three more and returned his elation had departed
as much as he had objected to the place now that it was no longer to exist he felt sorry
he wished that things were different
shaughnessy was coolly businesslike
well he said at five oclock we might as well count the change and divide they did so
the fixtures had already been sold and the sum divided
goodnight said hurstwood at the final moment in a last effort to be genial
so long said shaughnessy scarcely deigning a notice
thus the warren street arrangement was permanently concluded
carrie had prepared a good dinner at the flat but after his ride up hurstwood was in a solemn and reflective mood
well said carrie inquisitively
im out of that he answered taking off his coat
as she looked at him she wondered what his financial state was now
they ate and talked a little
will you have enough to buy in anywhere else asked carrie
no he said
ill have to get something else and save up it would be nice if you could get some place said carrie prompted by anxiety and hope
i guess i will he said reflectively
for some days thereafter he put on his overcoat regularly in the morning and sallied forth
on these ventures he first consoled himself with the thought that with the seven hundred dollars he had he could still make some advantageous arrangement
he thought about going to some brewery which as he knew frequently controlled saloons which they leased and get them to help him
then he remembered that he would have to pay out several hundred any way for fixtures and that he would have nothing left for his monthly expenses
it was costing him nearly eighty dollars a month to live
no he said in his sanest moments i cant do it
ill get something else and save up this gettingsomething proposition complicated itself the moment he began to think of what it was he wanted to do
manage a place
where should he get such a position
the papers contained no requests for managers
such positions he knew well enough were either secured by long years of service or were bought with a half or third interest
into a place important enough to need such a manager he had not money enough to buy
nevertheless he started out
his clothes were very good and his appearance still excellent but it involved the trouble of deluding
people looking at him imagined instantly that a man of his age stout and well dressed must be well off
he appeared a comfortable owner of something a man from whom the common run of mortals could well expect gratuities
being now fortythree years of age and comfortably built walking was not easy
he had not been used to exercise for many years
his legs tired his shoulders ached and his feet pained him at the close of the day even when he took street cars in almost every direction
the mere getting up and down if long continued produced this result
the fact that people took him to be better off than he was he well understood
it was so painfully clear to him that it retarded his search
not that he wished to be less wellappearing but that he was ashamed to belie his appearance by incongruous appeals
so he hesitated wondering what to do
he thought of the hotels but instantly he remembered that he had had no experience as a clerk and what was more important no acquaintances or friends in that line to whom he could go
he did know some hotel owners in several cities including new york but they knew of his dealings with fitzgerald and moy
he could not apply to them
he thought of other lines suggested by large buildings or businesses which he knew ofwholesale groceries hardware insurance concerns and the likebut he had had no experience
how to go about getting anything was a bitter thought
would he have to go personally and ask wait outside an office door and then distinguished and affluent looking announce that he was looking for something to do
he strained painfully at the thought
no he could not do that
he really strolled about thinking and then the weather being cold stepped into a hotel
he knew hotels well enough to know that any decent individual was welcome to a chair in the lobby
this was in the broadway central which was then one of the most important hotels in the city
taking a chair here was a painful thing to him
to think he should come to this
he had heard loungers about hotels called chairwarmers
he had called them that himself in his day
but here he was despite the possibility of meeting some one who knew him shielding himself from cold and the weariness of the streets in a hotel lobby
i cant do this way he said to himself
theres no use of my starting out mornings without first thinking up some place to go
ill think of some places and then look them up it occurred to him that the positions of bartenders were sometimes open but he put this out of his mind
bartenderhe the exmanager
it grew awfully dull sitting in the hotel lobby and so at four he went home
he tried to put on a business air as he went in but it was a feeble imitation
the rocking chair in the diningroom was comfortable
he sank into it gladly with several papers he had bought and began to read
as she was going through the room to begin preparing dinner carrie said the man was here for the rent today oh was he said hurstwood
the least wrinkle crept into his brow as he remembered that this was february d the time the man always called
he fished down in his pocket for his purse getting the first taste of paying out when nothing is coming in
he looked at the fat green roll as a sick man looks at the one possible saving cure
then he counted off twentyeight dollars
here you are he said to carrie when she came through again
he buried himself in his papers and read
oh the rest of itthe relief from walking and thinking
what lethean waters were these floods of telegraphed intelligence
he forgot his troubles in part
here was a young handsome woman if you might believe the newspaper drawing suing a rich fat candymaking husband in brooklyn for divorce
here was another item detailing the wrecking of a vessel in ice and snow off princes bay on staten island
a long bright column told of the doings in the theatrical worldthe plays produced the actors appearing the managers making announcements
fannie davenport was just opening at the fifth avenue
daly was producing king lear he read of the early departure for the season of a party composed of the vanderbilts and their friends for florida
an interesting shooting affray was on in the mountains of kentucky
so he read read read rocking in the warm room near the radiator and waiting for dinner to be served
chapter xxxv
the passing of effort the visage of care the next morning he looked over the papers and waded through a long list of advertisements making a few notes
then he turned to the malehelpwanted column but with disagreeable feelings
the day was before hima long day in which to discover somethingand this was how he must begin to discover
he scanned the long column which mostly concerned bakers bushelmen cooks compositors drivers and the like finding two things only which arrested his eye
one was a cashier wanted in a wholesale furniture house and the other a salesman for a whiskey house
he had never thought of the latter
at once he decided to look that up
the firm in question was alsbery co whiskey brokers
he was admitted almost at once to the manager on his appearance
goodmorning sir said the latter thinking at first that he was encountering one of his outoftown customers
goodmorning said hurstwood
you advertised i believe for a salesman oh said the man showing plainly the enlightenment which had come to him
yes
yes i did i thought id drop in said hurstwood with dignity
ive had some experience in that line myself oh have you said the man
what experience have you had well ive managed several liquor houses in my time
recently i owned a thirdinterest in a saloon at warren and hudson streets i see said the man
hurstwood ceased waiting for some suggestion
we did want a salesman said the man
i dont know as its anything youd care to take hold of though i see said hurstwood
well im in no position to choose just at present
if it were open i should be glad to get it the man did not take kindly at all to his no position to choose he wanted some one who wasnt thinking of a choice or something better
especially not an old man
he wanted some one young active and glad to work actively for a moderate sum
hurstwood did not please him at all
he had more of an air than his employers
well he said in answer wed be glad to consider your application
we shant decide for a few days yet
suppose you send us your references i will said hurstwood
he nodded goodmorning and came away
at the corner he looked at the furniture companys address and saw that it was in west twentythird street
accordingly he went up there
the place was not large enough however
it looked moderate the men in it idle and small salaried
he walked by glancing in and then decided not to go in there
they want a girl probably at ten a week he said
at one oclock he thought of eating and went to a restaurant in madison square
there he pondered over places which he might look up
he was tired
it was blowing up grey again
across the way through madison square park stood the great hotels looking down upon a busy scene
he decided to go over to the lobby of one and sit a while
it was warm in there and bright
he had seen no one he knew at the broadway central
in all likelihood he would encounter no one here
finding a seat on one of the red plush divans close to the great windows which look out on broadways busy rout he sat musing
his state did not seem so bad in here
sitting still and looking out he could take some slight consolation in the few hundred dollars he had in his purse
he could forget in a measure the weariness of the street and his tiresome searches
still it was only escape from a severe to a less severe state
he was still gloomy and disheartened
there minutes seemed to go very slowly
an hour was a long long time in passing
it was filled for him with observations and mental comments concerning the actual guests of the hotel who passed in and out and those more prosperous pedestrians whose good fortune showed in their clothes and spirits as they passed along broadway outside
it was nearly the first time since he had arrived in the city that his leisure afforded him ample opportunity to contemplate this spectacle
now being perforce idle himself he wondered at the activity of others
how gay were the youths he saw how pretty the women
such fine clothes they all wore
they were so intent upon getting somewhere
he saw coquettish glances cast by magnificent girls
ah the money it required to train with suchhow well he knew
how long it had been since he had had the opportunity to do so
the clock outside registered four
it was a little early but he thought he would go back to the flat
this going back to the flat was coupled with the thought that carrie would think he was sitting around too much if he came home early
he hoped he wouldnt have to but the day hung heavily on his hands
over there he was on his own ground
he could sit in his rockingchair and read
this busy distracting suggestive scene was shut out
he could read his papers
accordingly he went home
carrie was reading quite alone
it was rather dark in the flat shut in as it was
youll hurt your eyes he said when he saw her
after taking off his coat he felt it incumbent upon him to make some little report of his day
ive been talking with a wholesale liquor company he said
i may go on the road wouldnt that be nice said carrie
it wouldnt be such a bad thing he answered
always from the man at the corner now he bought two papersthe evening world and evening sun so now he merely picked his papers up as he came by without stopping
he drew up his chair near the radiator and lighted the gas
then it was as the evening before
his difficulties vanished in the items he so well loved to read
the next day was even worse than the one before because now he could not think of where to go
nothing he saw in the papers he studiedtill ten oclockappealed to him
he felt that he ought to go out and yet he sickened at the thought
where to where to
you mustnt forget to leave me my money for this week said carrie quietly
they had an arrangement by which he placed twelve dollars a week in her hands out of which to pay current expenses
he heaved a little sigh as she said this and drew out his purse
again he felt the dread of the thing
here he was taking off taking off and nothing coming in
lord he said in his own thoughts this cant go on to carrie he said nothing whatsoever
she could feel that her request disturbed him
to pay her would soon become a distressing thing
yet what have i got to do with it she thought
oh why should i be made to worry hurstwood went out and made for broadway
he wanted to think up some place
before long though he reached the grand hotel at thirtyfirst street
he knew of its comfortable lobby
he was cold after his twenty blocks walk
ill go in their barber shop and get a shave he thought
thus he justified himself in sitting down in here after his tonsorial treatment
again time hanging heavily on his hands he went home early and this continued for several days each day the need to hunt paining him and each day disgust depression shamefacedness driving him into lobby idleness
at last three days came in which a storm prevailed and he did not go out at all
the snow began to fall late one afternoon
it was a regular flurry of large soft white flakes
in the morning it was still coming down with a high wind and the papers announced a blizzard
from out the front windows one could see a deep soft bedding
i guess ill not try to go out today he said to carrie at breakfast
its going to be awful bad so the papers say the man hasnt brought my coal either said carrie who ordered by the bushel
ill go over and see about it said hurstwood
this was the first time he had ever suggested doing an errand but somehow the wish to sit about the house prompted it as a sort of compensation for the privilege
all day and all night it snowed and the city began to suffer from a general blockade of traffic
great attention was given to the details of the storm by the newspapers which played up the distress of the poor in large type
hurstwood sat and read by his radiator in the corner
he did not try to think about his need of work
this storm being so terrific and tying up all things robbed him of the need
he made himself wholly comfortable and toasted his feet
carrie observed his ease with some misgiving
for all the fury of the storm she doubted his comfort
he took his situation too philosophically
hurstwood however read on and on
he did not pay much attention to carrie
she fulfilled her household duties and said little to disturb him
the next day it was still snowing and the next bitter cold
hurstwood took the alarm of the paper and sat still
now he volunteered to do a few other little things
one was to go to the butcher another to the grocery
he really thought nothing of these little services in connection with their true significance
he felt as if he were not wholly uselessindeed in such a stress of weather quite worth while about the house
on the fourth day however it cleared and he read that the storm was over
now however he idled thinking how sloppy the streets would be
it was noon before he finally abandoned his papers and got under way
owing to the slightly warmer temperature the streets were bad
he went across fourteenth street on the car and got a transfer south on broadway
one little advertisement he had relating to a saloon down in pearl street
when he reached the broadway central however he changed his mind
whats the use he thought looking out upon the slop and snow
i couldnt buy into it
its a thousand to one nothing comes of it
i guess ill get off and off he got
in the lobby he took a seat and waited again wondering what he could do
while he was idly pondering satisfied to be inside a welldressed man passed up the lobby stopped looked sharply as if not sure of his memory and then approached
hurstwood recognised cargill the owner of the large stables in chicago of the same name whom he had last seen at avery hall the night carrie appeared there
the remembrance of how this individual brought up his wife to shake hands on that occasion was also on the instant clear
hurstwood was greatly abashed
his eyes expressed the difficulty he felt
why its hurstwood said cargill remembering now and sorry that he had not recognised him quickly enough in the beginning to have avoided this meeting
yes said hurstwood
how are you very well said cargill troubled for something to talk about
stopping here no said hurstwood just keeping an appointment i knew you had left chicago
i was wondering what had become of you oh im here now answered hurstwood anxious to get away
doing well i suppose excellent glad to hear it they looked at one another rather embarrassed
well i have an engagement with a friend upstairs
ill leave you
so long hurstwood nodded his head
damn it all he murmured turning toward the door
i knew that would happen he walked several blocks up the street
his watch only registered
he tried to think of some place to go or something to do
the day was so bad he wanted only to be inside
finally his feet began to feel wet and cold and he boarded a car
this took him to fiftyninth street which was as good as anywhere else
landed here he turned to walk back along seventh avenue but the slush was too much
the misery of lounging about with nowhere to go became intolerable
he felt as if he were catching cold
stopping at a corner he waited for a car south bound
this was no day to be out he would go home
carrie was surprised to see him at a quarter of three
its a miserable day out was all he said
then he took off his coat and changed his shoes
that night he felt a cold coming on and took quinine
he was feverish until morning and sat about the next day while carrie waited on him
he was a helpless creature in sickness not very handsome in a dullcoloured bath gown and his hair uncombed
he looked haggard about the eyes and quite old
carrie noticed this and it did not appeal to her
she wanted to be goodnatured and sympathetic but something about the man held her aloof
toward evening he looked so badly in the weak light that she suggested he go to bed
youd better sleep alone she said youll feel better
ill open your bed for you now all right he said
as she did all these things she was in a most despondent state
what a life
what a life was her one thought
once during the day when he sat near the radiator hunched up and reading she passed through and seeing him wrinkled her brows
in the front room where it was not so warm she sat by the window and cried
this was the life cut out for her was it
to live cooped up in a small flat with some one who was out of work idle and indifferent to her
she was merely a servant to him now nothing more
this crying made her eyes red and when in preparing his bed she lighted the gas and having prepared it called him in he noticed the fact
whats the matter with you he asked looking into her face
his voice was hoarse and his unkempt head only added to its grewsome quality
nothing said carrie weakly
youve been crying he said
i havent either she answered
it was not for love of him that he knew
you neednt cry he said getting into bed
things will come out all right in a day or two he was up again but rough weather holding he stayed in
the italian newsdealer now delivered the morning papers and these he read assiduously
a few times after that he ventured out but meeting another of his oldtime friends he began to feel uneasy sitting about hotel corridors
every day he came home early and at last made no pretence of going anywhere
winter was no time to look for anything
naturally being about the house he noticed the way carrie did things
she was far from perfect in household methods and economy and her little deviations on this score first caught his eye
not however before her regular demand for her allowance became a grievous thing
sitting around as he did the weeks seemed to pass very quickly
every tuesday carrie asked for her money
do you think we live as cheaply as we might he asked one tuesday morning
i do the best i can said carrie
nothing was added to this at the moment but the next day he said do you ever go to the gansevoort market over here i didnt know there was such a market said carrie
they say you can get things lots cheaper there carrie was very indifferent to the suggestion
these were things which she did not like at all
how much do you pay for a pound of meat he asked one day
oh there are different prices said carrie
sirloin steak is twentytwo cents thats steep isnt it he answered
so he asked about other things until finally with the passing days it seemed to become a mania with him
he learned the prices and remembered them
his errandrunning capacity also improved
it began in a small way of course
carrie going to get her hat one morning was stopped by him
where are you going carrie he asked
over to the bakers she answered
id just as leave go for you he said
she acquiesced and he went
each afternoon he would go to the corner for the papers
is there anything you want he would say
by degrees she began to use him
doing this however she lost the weekly payment of twelve dollars
you want to pay me today she said one tuesday about this time
how much he asked
she understood well enough what it meant
well about five dollars she answered
i owe the coal man the same day he said i think this italian up here on the corner sells coal at twentyfive cents a bushel
ill trade with him carrie heard this with indifference
all right she said
then it came to be george i must have some coal today or you must get some meat of some kind for dinner he would find out what she needed and order
accompanying this plan came skimpiness
i only got a halfpound of steak he said coming in one afternoon with his papers
we never seem to eat very much these miserable details ate the heart out of carrie
they blackened her days and grieved her soul
oh how this man had changed
all day and all day here he sat reading his papers
the world seemed to have no attraction
once in a while he would go out in fine weather it might be four or five hours between eleven and four
she could do nothing but view him with gnawing contempt
it was apathy with hurstwood resulting from his inability to see his way out
each month drew from his small store
now he had only five hundred dollars left and this he hugged half feeling as if he could stave off absolute necessity for an indefinite period
sitting around the house he decided to wear some old clothes he had
this came first with the bad days
only once he apologised in the very beginning its so bad today ill just wear these around eventually these became the permanent thing
also he had been wont to pay fifteen cents for a shave and a tip of ten cents
in his first distress he cut down the tip to five then to nothing
later he tried a tencent barber shop and finding that the shave was satisfactory patronised regularly
later still he put off shaving to every other day then to every third and so on until once a week became the rule
on saturday he was a sight to see
of course as his own selfrespect vanished it perished for him in carrie
she could not understand what had gotten into the man
he had some money he had a decent suit remaining he was not bad looking when dressed up
she did not forget her own difficult struggle in chicago but she did not forget either that she had never ceased trying
he never tried
he did not even consult the ads in the papers any more
finally a distinct impression escaped from her
what makes you put so much butter on the steak he asked her one evening standing around in the kitchen
to make it good of course she answered
butter is awful dear these days he suggested
you wouldnt mind it if you were working she answered
he shut up after this and went in to his paper but the retort rankled in his mind
it was the first cutting remark that had come from her
that same evening carrie after reading went off to the front room to bed
this was unusual
when hurstwood decided to go he retired as usual without a light
it was then that he discovered carries absence
thats funny he said maybe shes sitting up he gave the matter no more thought but slept
in the morning she was not beside him
strange to say this passed without comment
night approaching and a slightly more conversational feeling prevailing carrie said i think ill sleep alone tonight
i have a headache all right said hurstwood
the third night she went to her front bed without apologies
this was a grim blow to hurstwood but he never mentioned it
all right he said to himself with an irrepressible frown let her sleep alone chapter xxxvi
a grim retrogression the phantom of chance the vances who had been back in the city ever since christmas had not forgotten carrie but they or rather mrs vance had never called on her for the very simple reason that carrie had never sent her address
true to her nature she corresponded with mrs vance as long as she still lived in seventyeighth street but when she was compelled to move into thirteenth her fear that the latter would take it as an indication of reduced circumstances caused her to study some way of avoiding the necessity of giving her address
not finding any convenient method she sorrowfully resigned the privilege of writing to her friend entirely
the latter wondered at this strange silence thought carrie must have left the city and in the end gave her up as lost
so she was thoroughly surprised to encounter her in fourteenth street where she had gone shopping
carrie was there for the same purpose
why mrs wheeler said mrs vance looking carrie over in a glance where have you been
why havent you been to see me
ive been wondering all this time what had become of you
really i im so glad to see you said carrie pleased and yet nonplussed
of all times this was the worst to encounter mrs vance
why im living down town here
ive been intending to come and see you
where are you living now in fiftyeighth street said mrs vance just off seventh avenue
why dont you come and see me i will said carrie
really ive been wanting to come
i know i ought to
its a shame
but you know whats your number said mrs vance
thirteenth street said carrie reluctantly
west oh said mrs vance thats right near here isnt it yes said carrie
you must come down and see me some time well youre a fine one said mrs vance laughing the while noting that carries appearance had modified somewhat
the address too she added to herself
they must be hard up still she liked carrie well enough to take her in tow
come with me in here a minute she exclaimed turning into a store
when carrie returned home there was hurstwood reading as usual
he seemed to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance
his beard was at least four days old
oh thought carrie if she were to come here and see him she shook her head in absolute misery
it looked as if her situation was becoming unbearable
driven to desperation she asked at dinner did you ever hear any more from that wholesale house no he said
they dont want an inexperienced man carrie dropped the subject feeling unable to say more
i met mrs vance this afternoon she said after a time
did eh he answered
theyre back in new york now carrie went on
she did look so nice well she can afford it as long as he puts up for it returned hurstwood
hes got a soft job hurstwood was looking into the paper
he could not see the look of infinite weariness and discontent carrie gave him
she said she thought shed call here some day shes been long getting round to it hasnt she said hurstwood with a kind of sarcasm
the woman didnt appeal to him from her spending side
oh i dont know said carrie angered by the mans attitude
perhaps i didnt want her to come shes too gay said hurstwood significantly
no one can keep up with her pace unless theyve got a lot of money mr
vance doesnt seem to find it very hard he may not now answered hurstwood doggedly well understanding the inference but his life isnt done yet
you cant tell whatll happen
he may get down like anybody else there was something quite knavish in the mans attitude
his eye seemed to be cocked with a twinkle upon the fortunate expecting their defeat
his own state seemed a thing apartnot considered
this thing was the remains of his oldtime cocksureness and independence
sitting in his flat and reading of the doings of other people sometimes this independent undefeated mood came upon him
forgetting the weariness of the streets and the degradation of search he would sometimes prick up his ears
it was as if he said i can do something
im not down yet
theres a lot of things coming to me if i want to go after them it was in this mood that he would occasionally dress up go for a shave and putting on his gloves sally forth quite actively
not with any definite aim
it was more a barometric condition
he felt just right for being outside and doing something
on such occasions his money went also
he knew of several poker rooms down town
a few acquaintances he had in downtown resorts and about the city hall
it was a change to see them and exchange a few friendly commonplaces
he had once been accustomed to hold a pretty fair hand at poker
many a friendly game had netted him a hundred dollars or more at the time when that sum was merely sauce to the dish of the gamenot the all in all
now he thought of playing
i might win a couple of hundred
im not out of practice it is but fair to say that this thought had occurred to him several times before he acted upon it
the poker room which he first invaded was over a saloon in west street near one of the ferries
he had been there before
several games were going
these he watched for a time and noticed that the pots were quite large for the ante involved
deal me a hand he said at the beginning of a new shuffle
he pulled up a chair and studied his cards
those playing made that quiet study of him which is so unapparent and yet invariably so searching
poor fortune was with him at first
he received a mixed collection without progression or pairs
the pot was opened
i pass he said
on the strength of this he was content to lose his ante
the deals did fairly by him in the long run causing him to come away with a few dollars to the good
the next afternoon he was back again seeking amusement and profit
this time he followed up three of a kind to his doom
there was a better hand across the table held by a pugnacious irish youth who was a political hangeron of the tammany district in which they were located
hurstwood was surprised at the persistence of this individual whose bets came with a sangfroid which if a bluff was excellent art
hurstwood began to doubt but kept or thought to keep at least the cool demeanour with which in olden times he deceived those psychic students of the gaming table who seem to read thoughts and moods rather than exterior evidences however subtle
he could not down the cowardly thought that this man had something better and would stay to the end drawing his last dollar into the pot should he choose to go so far
still he hoped to win muchhis hand was excellent
why not raise it five more
i raise you three said the youth
make it five said hurstwood pushing out his chips
come again said the youth pushing out a small pile of reds
let me have some more chips said hurstwood to the keeper in charge taking out a bill
a cynical grin lit up the face of his youthful opponent
when the chips were laid out hurstwood met the raise
five again said the youth
hurstwoods brow was wet
he was deep in nowvery deep for him
sixty dollars of his good money was up
he was ordinarily no coward but the thought of losing so much weakened him
finally he gave way
he would not trust to this fine hand any longer
i call he said
a full house said the youth spreading out his cards
hurstwoods hand dropped
i thought i had you he said weakly
the youth raked in his chips and hurstwood came away not without first stopping to count his remaining cash on the stair
three hundred and forty dollars he said
with this loss and ordinary expenses so much had already gone
back in the flat he decided he would play no more
remembering mrs vances promise to call carrie made one other mild protest
it was concerning hurstwoods appearance
this very day coming home he changed his clothes to the old togs he sat around in
what makes you always put on those old clothes asked carrie
whats the use wearing my good ones around here he asked
well i should think youd feel better then she added some one might call who he said
well mrs vance said carrie
she neednt see me he answered sullenly
this lack of pride and interest made carrie almost hate him
oh she thought there he sits
she neednt see me i should think he would be ashamed of himself the real bitterness of this thing was added when mrs vance did call
it was on one of her shopping rounds
making her way up the commonplace hall she knocked at carries door
to her subsequent and agonising distress carrie was out
hurstwood opened the door halfthinking that the knock was carries
for once he was taken honestly aback
the lost voice of youth and pride spoke in him
why he said actually stammering how do you do how do you do said mrs vance who could scarcely believe her eyes
his great confusion she instantly perceived
he did not know whether to invite her in or not
is your wife at home she inquired
no he said carries out but wont you step in
shell be back shortly noo said mrs vance realising the change of it all
im really very much in a hurry
i thought id just run up and look in but i couldnt stay
just tell your wife she must come and see me i will said hurstwood standing back and feeling intense relief at her going
he was so ashamed that he folded his hands weakly as he sat in the chair afterwards and thought
carrie coming in from another direction thought she saw mrs vance going away
she strained her eyes but could not make sure
was anybody here just now she asked of hurstwood
yes he said guiltily mrs
vance did she see you she asked expressing her full despair
this cut hurstwood like a whip and made him sullen
if she had eyes she did
i opened the door oh said carrie closing one hand tightly out of sheer nervousness
what did she have to say nothing he answered
she couldnt stay and you looking like that said carrie throwing aside a long reserve
what of it he said angering
i didnt know she was coming did i you knew she might said carrie
i told you she said she was coming
ive asked you a dozen times to wear your other clothes
oh i think this is just terrible oh let up he answered
what difference does it make
you couldnt associate with her anyway
theyve got too much money
who said i wanted to said carrie fiercely
well you act like it rowing around over my looks
youd think id committed carrie interrupted its true she said
i couldnt if i wanted to but whose fault is it
youre very free to sit and talk about who i could associate with
why dont you get out and look for work this was a thunderbolt in camp
whats it to you he said rising almost fiercely
i pay the rent dont i
i furnish the yes you pay the rent said carrie
you talk as if there was nothing else in the world but a flat to sit around in
you havent done a thing for three months except sit around and interfere here
id like to know what you married me for i didnt marry you he said in a snarling tone
id like to know what you did then in montreal she answered
well i didnt marry you he answered
you can get that out of your head
you talk as though you didnt know carrie looked at him a moment her eyes distending
she had believed it was all legal and binding enough
what did you lie to me for then she asked fiercely
what did you force me to run away with you for her voice became almost a sob
force he said with curled lip
a lot of forcing i did oh said carrie breaking under the strain and turning
oh oh and she hurried into the front room
hurstwood was now hot and waked up
it was a great shaking up for him both mental and moral
he wiped his brow as he looked around and then went for his clothes and dressed
not a sound came from carrie she ceased sobbing when she heard him dressing
she thought at first with the faintest alarm of being left without moneynot of losing him though he might be going away permanently
she heard him open the top of the wardrobe and take out his hat
then the diningroom door closed and she knew he had gone
after a few moments of silence she stood up dryeyed and looked out the window
hurstwood was just strolling up the street from the flat toward sixth avenue
the latter made progress along thirteenth and across fourteenth street to union square
look for work he said to himself
look for work
she tells me to get out and look for work he tried to shield himself from his own mental accusation which told him that she was right
what a cursed thing that mrs vances call was anyhow he thought
stood right there and looked me over
i know what she was thinking he remembered the few times he had seen her in seventyeight street
she was always a swelllooker and he had tried to put on the air of being worthy of such as she in front of her
now to think she had caught him looking this way
he wrinkled his forehead in his distress
the devil he said a dozen times in an hour
it was a quarter after four when he left the house
carrie was in tears
there would be no dinner that night
what the deuce he said swaggering mentally to hide his own shame from himself
im not so bad
im not down yet he looked around the square and seeing the several large hotels decided to go to one for dinner
he would get his papers and make himself comfortable there
he ascended into the fine parlour of the morton house then one of the best new york hotels and finding a cushioned seat read
it did not trouble him much that his decreasing sum of money did not allow of such extravagance
like the morphine fiend he was becoming addicted to his ease
anything to relieve his mental distress to satisfy his craving for comfort
he must do it
no thoughts for the morrowhe could not stand to think of it any more than he could of any other calamity
like the certainty of death he tried to shut the certainty of soon being without a dollar completely out of his mind and he came very near doing it
welldressed guests moving to and fro over the thick carpets carried him back to the old days
a young lady a guest of the house playing a piano in an alcove pleased him
he sat there reading
his dinner cost him
by eight oclock he was through and then seeing guests leaving and the crowd of pleasureseekers thickening outside wondered where he should go
not home
carrie would be up
no he would not go back there this evening
he would stay out and knock around as a man who was independentnot brokewell might
he bought a cigar and went outside on the corner where other individuals were loungingbrokers racing people thespianshis own flesh and blood
as he stood there he thought of the old evenings in chicago and how he used to dispose of them
manys the game he had had
this took him to poker
i didnt do that thing right the other day he thought referring to his loss of sixty dollars
i shouldnt have weakened
i could have bluffed that fellow down
i wasnt in form thats what ailed me then he studied the possibilities of the game as it had been played and began to figure how he might have won in several instances by bluffing a little harder
im old enough to play poker and do something with it
ill try my hand tonight visions of a big stake floated before him
supposing he did win a couple of hundred wouldnt he be in it
lots of sports he knew made their living at this game and a good living too
they always had as much as i had he thought
so off he went to a poker room in the neighbourhood feeling much as he had in the old days
in this period of selfforgetfulness aroused first by the shock of argument and perfected by a dinner in the hotel with cocktails and cigars he was as nearly like the old hurstwood as he would ever be again
it was not the old hurstwoodonly a man arguing with a divided conscience and lured by a phantom
this poker room was much like the other one only it was a back room in a better drinking resort
hurstwood watched a while and then seeing an interesting game joined in
as before it went easy for a while he winning a few times and cheering up losing a few pots and growing more interested and determined on that account
at last the fascinating game took a strong hold on him
he enjoyed its risks and ventured on a trifling hand to bluff the company and secure a fair stake
to his selfsatisfaction intense and strong he did it
in the height of this feeling he began to think his luck was with him
no one else had done so well
now came another moderate hand and again he tried to open the jackpot on it
there were others there who were almost reading his heart so close was their observation
i have three of a kind said one of the players to himself
ill just stay with that fellow to the finish the result was that bidding began
i raise you ten good ten more good ten again right you are it got to where hurstwood had seventyfive dollars up
the other man really became serious
perhaps this individual hurstwood really did have a stiff hand
i call he said
hurstwood showed his hand
he was done
the bitter fact that he had lost seventyfive dollars made him desperate
lets have another pot he said grimly
all right said the man
some of the other players quit but observant loungers took their places
time passed and it came to twelve oclock
hurstwood held on neither winning nor losing much
then he grew weary and on a last hand lost twenty more
he was sick at heart
at a quarter after one in the morning he came out of the place
the chill bare streets seemed a mockery of his state
he walked slowly west little thinking of his row with carrie
he ascended the stairs and went into his room as if there had been no trouble
it was his loss that occupied his mind
sitting down on the bedside he counted his money
there was now but a hundred and ninety dollars and some change
he put it up and began to undress
i wonder whats getting into me anyhow he said
in the morning carrie scarcely spoke and he felt as if he must go out again
he had treated her badly but he could not afford to make up
now desperation seized him and for a day or two going out thus he lived like a gentlemanor what he conceived to be a gentlemanwhich took money
for his escapades he was soon poorer in mind and body to say nothing of his purse which had lost thirty by the process
then he came down to cold bitter sense again
the rent man comes today said carrie greeting him thus indifferently three mornings later
he does yes this is the second answered carrie
hurstwood frowned
then in despair he got out his purse
it seems an awful lot to pay for rent he said
he was nearing his last hundred dollars
chapter xxxvii
the spirit awakens new search for the gate it would be useless to explain how in due time the last fifty dollars was in sight
the seven hundred by his process of handling had only carried them into june
before the final hundred mark was reached he began to indicate that a calamity was approaching
i dont know he said one day taking a trivial expenditure for meat as a text it seems to take an awful lot for us to live it doesnt seem to me said carrie that we spend very much my money is nearly gone he said and i hardly know where its gone to all that seven hundred dollars asked carrie
all but a hundred he looked so disconsolate that it scared her
she began to see that she herself had been drifting
she had felt it all the time
well george she exclaimed why dont you get out and look for something
you could find something i have looked he said
you cant make people give you a place she gazed weakly at him and said well what do you think you will do
a hundred dollars wont last long i dont know he said
i cant do any more than look carrie became frightened over this announcement
she thought desperately upon the subject
frequently she had considered the stage as a door through which she might enter that gilded state which she had so much craved
now as in chicago it came as a last resource in distress
something must be done if he did not get work soon
perhaps she would have to go out and battle again alone
she began to wonder how one would go about getting a place
her experience in chicago proved that she had not tried the right way
there must be people who would listen to and try youmen who would give you an opportunity
they were talking at the breakfast table a morning or two later when she brought up the dramatic subject by saying that she saw that sarah bernhardt was coming to this country
hurstwood had seen it too
how do people get on the stage george she finally asked innocently
i dont know he said
there must be dramatic agents carrie was sipping coffee and did not look up
regular people who get you a place yes i think so he answered
suddenly the air with which she asked attracted his attention
youre not still thinking about being an actress are you he asked
no she answered i was just wondering without being clear there was something in the thought which he objected to
he did not believe any more after three years of observation that carrie would ever do anything great in that line
she seemed too simple too yielding
his idea of the art was that it involved something more pompous
if she tried to get on the stage she would fall into the hands of some cheap manager and become like the rest of them
he had a good idea of what he meant by them
carrie was pretty
she would get along all right but where would he be
id get that idea out of my head if i were you
its a lot more difficult than you think carrie felt this to contain in some way an aspersion upon her ability
you said i did real well in chicago she rejoined
you did he answered seeing that he was arousing opposition but chicago isnt new york by a big jump carrie did not answer this at all
it hurt her
the stage he went on is all right if you can be one of the big guns but theres nothing to the rest of it
it takes a long while to get up oh i dont know said carrie slightly aroused
in a flash he thought he foresaw the result of this thing
now when the worst of his situation was approaching she would get on the stage in some cheap way and forsake him
strangely he had not conceived well of her mental ability
that was because he did not understand the nature of emotional greatness
he had never learned that a person might be emotionallyinstead of intellectuallygreat
avery hall was too far away for him to look back and sharply remember
he had lived with this woman too long
well i do he answered
if i were you i wouldnt think of it
its not much of a profession for a woman its better than going hungry said carrie
if you dont want me to do that why dont you get work yourself there was no answer ready for this
he had got used to the suggestion
oh let up he answered
the result of this was that she secretly resolved to try
it didnt matter about him
she was not going to be dragged into poverty and something worse to suit him
she could act
she could get something and then work up
what would he say then
she pictured herself already appearing in some fine performance on broadway of going every evening to her dressingroom and making up
then she would come out at eleven oclock and see the carriages ranged about waiting for the people
it did not matter whether she was the star or not
if she were only once in getting a decent salary wearing the kind of clothes she liked having the money to do with going here and there as she pleased how delightful it would all be
her mind ran over this picture all the day long
hurstwoods dreary state made its beauty become more and more vivid
curiously this idea soon took hold of hurstwood
his vanishing sum suggested that he would need sustenance
why could not carrie assist him a little until he could get something
he came in one day with something of this idea in his mind
i met john b drake today he said
hes going to open a hotel here in the fall
he says that he can make a place for me then who is he asked carrie
hes the man that runs the grand pacific in chicago oh said carrie
id get about fourteen hundred a year out of that that would be good wouldnt it she said sympathetically
if i can only get over this summer he added i think ill be all right
im hearing from some of my friends again carrie swallowed this story in all its pristine beauty
she sincerely wished he could get through the summer
he looked so hopeless
how much money have you left only fifty dollars oh mercy she exclaimed what will we do
its only twenty days until the rent will be due again hurstwood rested his head on his hands and looked blankly at the floor
maybe you could get something in the stage line he blandly suggested
maybe i could said carrie glad that some one approved of the idea
ill lay my hand to whatever i can get he said now that he saw her brighten up
i can get something she cleaned up the things one morning after he had gone dressed as neatly as her wardrobe permitted and set out for broadway
she did not know that thoroughfare very well
to her it was a wonderful conglomeration of everything great and mighty
the theatres were therethese agencies must be somewhere about
she decided to stop in at the madison square theatre and ask how to find the theatrical agents
this seemed the sensible way
accordingly when she reached that theatre she applied to the clerk at the box office
eh he said looking out
dramatic agents
i dont know
youll find them in the clipper though
they all advertise in that is that a paper said carrie
yes said the clerk marvelling at such ignorance of a common fact
you can get it at the newsstands he added politely seeing how pretty the inquirer was
carrie proceeded to get the clipper and tried to find the agents by looking over it as she stood beside the stand
this could not be done so easily
thirteenth street was a number of blocks off but she went back carrying the precious paper and regretting the waste of time
hurstwood was already there sitting in his place
where were you he asked
ive been trying to find some dramatic agents he felt a little diffident about asking concerning her success
the paper she began to scan attracted his attention
what have you got there he asked
the clipper the man said id find their addresses in here have you been all the way over to broadway to find that out
i could have told you why didnt you she asked without looking up
you never asked me he returned
she went hunting aimlessly through the crowded columns
her mind was distracted by this mans indifference
the difficulty of the situation she was facing was only added to by all he did
selfcommiseration brewed in her heart
tears trembled along her eyelids but did not fall
hurstwood noticed something
let me look to recover herself she went into the front room while he searched
presently she returned
he had a pencil and was writing upon an envelope
herere three he said
carrie took it and found that one was mrs bermudez another marcus jenks a third percy weil
she paused only a moment and then moved toward the door
i might as well go right away she said without looking back
hurstwood saw her depart with some faint stirrings of shame which were the expression of a manhood rapidly becoming stultified
he sat a while and then it became too much
he got up and put on his hat
i guess ill go out he said to himself and went strolling nowhere in particular but feeling somehow that he must go
carries first call was upon mrs bermudez whose address was quite the nearest
it was an oldfashioned residence turned into offices
mrs bermudezs offices consisted of what formerly had been a back chamber and a hall bedroom marked private as carrie entered she noticed several persons lounging aboutmen who said nothing and did nothing
while she was waiting to be noticed the door of the hall bedroom opened and from it issued two very mannishlooking women very tightly dressed and wearing white collars and cuffs
after them came a portly lady of about fortyfive lighthaired sharpeyed and evidently goodnatured
at least she was smiling
now dont forget about that said one of the mannish women
i wont said the portly woman
lets see she added where are you the first week in february pittsburg said the woman
ill write you there all right said the other and the two passed out
instantly the portly ladys face became exceedingly sober and shrewd
she turned about and fixed on carrie a very searching eye
well she said young woman what can i do for you are you mrs bermudez yes well said carrie hesitating how to begin do you get places for persons upon the stage yes could you get me one have you ever had any experience a very little said carrie
whom did you play with oh with no one said carrie
it was just a show gotten oh i see said the woman interrupting her
no i dont know of anything now carries countenance fell
you want to get some new york experience concluded the affable mrs bermudez
well take your name though carrie stood looking while the lady retired to her office
what is your address inquired a young lady behind the counter taking up the curtailed conversation
mrs
george wheeler said carrie moving over to where she was writing
the woman wrote her address in full and then allowed her to depart at her leisure
she encountered a very similar experience in the office of mr jenks only he varied it by saying at the close if you could play at some local house or had a programme with your name on it i might do something in the third place the individual asked what sort of work do you want to do what do you mean said carrie
well do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville stage or in the chorus oh id like to get a part in a play said carrie
well said the man itll cost you something to do that how much said carrie who ridiculous as it may seem had not thought of this before
well thats for you to say he answered shrewdly
carrie looked at him curiously
she hardly knew how to continue the inquiry
could you get me a part if i paid if we didnt youd get your money back oh she said
the agent saw he was dealing with an inexperienced soul and continued accordingly
youd want to deposit fifty dollars anyway
no agent would trouble about you for less than that carrie saw a light
thank you she said
ill think about it she started to go and then bethought herself
how soon would i get a place she asked
well thats hard to say said the man
you might get one in a week or it might be a month
youd get the first thing that we thought you could do i see said carrie and then halfsmiling to be agreeable she walked out
the agent studied a moment and then said to himself its funny how anxious these women are to get on the stage carrie found ample food for reflection in the fiftydollar proposition
maybe theyd take my money and not give me anything she thought
she had some jewelrya diamond ring and pin and several other pieces
she could get fifty dollars for those if she went to a pawnbroker
hurstwood was home before her
he had not thought she would be so long seeking
well he said not venturing to ask what news
i didnt find out anything today said carrie taking off her gloves
they all want money to get you a place how much asked hurstwood
fifty dollars they dont want anything do they oh theyre like everybody else
you cant tell whether theyd ever get you anything after you did pay them well i wouldnt put up fifty on that basis said hurstwood as if he were deciding money in hand
i dont know said carrie
i think ill try some of the managers hurstwood heard this dead to the horror of it
he rocked a little to and fro and chewed at his finger
it seemed all very natural in such extreme states
he would do better later on
chapter xxxviii
in elf land disporting the grim world without when carrie renewed her search as she did the next day going to the casino she found that in the opera chorus as in other fields employment is difficult to secure
girls who can stand in a line and look pretty are as numerous as labourers who can swing a pick
she found there was no discrimination between one and the other of applicants save as regards a conventional standard of prettiness and form
their own opinion or knowledge of their ability went for nothing
where shall i find mr gray she asked of a sulky doorman at the stage entrance of the casino
you cant see him now hes busy do you know when i can see him got an appointment with him no well youll have to call at his office oh dear exclaimed carrie
where is his office he gave her the number
she knew there was no need of calling there now
he would not be in
nothing remained but to employ the intermediate hours in search
the dismal story of ventures in other places is quickly told
mr daly saw no one save by appointment
carrie waited an hour in a dingy office quite in spite of obstacles to learn this fact of the placid indifferent mr dorney
you will have to write and ask him to see you so she went away
at the empire theatre she found a hive of peculiarly listless and indifferent individuals
everything ornately upholstered everything carefully finished everything remarkably reserved
at the lyceum she entered one of those secluded understairway closets berugged and bepaneled which causes one to feel the greatness of all positions of authority
here was reserve itself done into a boxoffice clerk a doorman and an assistant glorying in their fine positions
ah be very humble nowvery humble indeed
tell us what it is you require
tell it quickly nervously and without a vestige of selfrespect
if no trouble to us in any way we may see what we can do this was the atmosphere of the lyceumthe attitude for that matter of every managerial office in the city
these little proprietors of businesses are lords indeed on their own ground
carrie came away wearily somewhat more abashed for her pains
hurstwood heard the details of the weary and unavailing search that evening
i didnt get to see any one said carrie
i just walked and walked and waited around hurstwood only looked at her
i suppose you have to have some friends before you can get in she added disconsolately
hurstwood saw the difficulty of this thing and yet it did not seem so terrible
carrie was tired and dispirited but now she could rest
viewing the world from his rockingchair its bitterness did not seem to approach so rapidly
tomorrow was another day
tomorrow came and the next and the next
carrie saw the manager at the casino once
come around he said the first of next week
i may make some changes then he was a large and corpulent individual surfeited with good clothes and good eating who judged women as another would horseflesh
carrie was pretty and graceful
she might be put in even if she did not have any experience
one of the proprietors had suggested that the chorus was a little weak on looks
the first of next week was some days off yet
the first of the month was drawing near
carrie began to worry as she had never worried before
do you really look for anything when you go out she asked hurstwood one morning as a climax to some painful thoughts of her own
of course i do he said pettishly troubling only a little over the disgrace of the insinuation
id take anything she said for the present
it will soon be the first of the month again she looked the picture of despair
hurstwood quit reading his paper and changed his clothes
he would look for something he thought
he would go and see if some brewery couldnt get him in somewhere
yes he would take a position as bartender if he could get it it was the same sort of pilgrimage he had made before
one or two slight rebuffs and the bravado disappeared
no use he thought
i might as well go on back home now that his money was so low he began to observe his clothes and feel that even his best ones were beginning to look commonplace
this was a bitter thought
carrie came in after he did
i went to see some of the variety managers she said aimlessly
you have to have an act
they dont want anybody that hasnt i saw some of the brewery people today said hurstwood
one man told me hed try to make a place for me in two or three weeks in the face of so much distress on carries part he had to make some showing and it was thus he did so
it was lassitudes apology to energy
monday carrie went again to the casino
did i tell you to come around today said the manager looking her over as she stood before him
you said the first of the week said carrie greatly abashed
ever had any experience he asked again almost severely
carrie owned to ignorance
he looked her over again as he stirred among some papers
he was secretly pleased with this pretty disturbedlooking young woman
come around to the theatre tomorrow morning carries heart bounded to her throat
i will she said with difficulty
she could see he wanted her and turned to go
would he really put her to work
oh blessed fortune could it be already the hard rumble of the city through the open windows became pleasant
a sharp voice answered her mental interrogation driving away all immediate fears on that score
be sure youre there promptly the manager said roughly
youll be dropped if youre not carrie hastened away
she did not quarrel now with hurstwoods idleness
she had a placeshe had a place
this sang in her ears
in her delight she was almost anxious to tell hurstwood
but as she walked homeward and her survey of the facts of the case became larger she began to think of the anomaly of her finding work in several weeks and his lounging in idleness for a number of months
why dont he get something she openly said to herself
if i can he surely ought to
it wasnt very hard for me she forgot her youth and her beauty
the handicap of age she did not in her enthusiasm perceive
thus ever the voice of success
still she could not keep her secret
she tried to be calm and indifferent but it was a palpable sham
well he said seeing her relieved face
i have a place you have he said breathing a better breath
yes what sort of a place is it he asked feeling in his veins as if now he might get something good also
in the chorus she answered
is it the casino show you told me about yes she answered
i begin rehearsing tomorrow there was more explanation volunteered by carrie because she was happy
at last hurstwood said do you know how much youll get no i didnt want to ask said carrie
i guess they pay twelve or fourteen dollars a week about that i guess said hurstwood
there was a good dinner in the flat that evening owing to the mere lifting of the terrible strain
hurstwood went out for a shave and returned with a fairsized sirloin steak
now tomorrow he thought ill look around myself and with renewed hope he lifted his eyes from the ground
on the morrow carrie reported promptly and was given a place in the line
she saw a large empty shadowy playhouse still redolent of the perfumes and blazonry of the night and notable for its rich oriental appearance
the wonder of it awed and delighted her
blessed be its wondrous reality
how hard she would try to be worthy of it
it was above the common mass above idleness above want above insignificance
people came to it in finery and carriages to see
it was ever a centre of light and mirth
and here she was of it
oh if she could only remain how happy would be her days
what is your name said the manager who was conducting the drill
madenda she replied instantly mindful of the name drouet had selected in chicago
carrie madenda well now miss madenda he said very affably as carrie thought you go over there then he called to a young woman who was already of the company miss clark you pair with miss madenda this young lady stepped forward so that carrie saw where to go and the rehearsal began
carrie soon found that while this drilling had some slight resemblance to the rehearsals as conducted at avery hall the attitude of the manager was much more pronounced
she had marvelled at the insistence and superior airs of mr millice but the individual conducting here had the same insistence coupled with almost brutal roughness
as the drilling proceeded he seemed to wax exceedingly wroth over trifles and to increase his lung power in proportion
it was very evident that he had a great contempt for any assumption of dignity or innocence on the part of these young women
clark he would callmeaning of course miss clarkwhy dont you catch step there by fours right
right i said right
for heavens sake get on to yourself
right and in saying this he would lift the last sounds into a vehement roar
maitland
maitland he called once
a nervous comelydressed little girl stepped out
carrie trembled for her out of the fulness of her own sympathies and fear
yes sir said miss maitland
is there anything the matter with your ears no sir do you know what column left means yes sir well what are you stumbling around the right for
want to break up the line i was just never mind what you were just
keep your ears open carrie pitied and trembled for her turn
yet another suffered the pain of personal rebuke
hold on a minute cried the manager throwing up his hands as if in despair
his demeanour was fierce
elvers he shouted what have you got in your mouth nothing said miss elvers while some smiled and stood nervously by
well are you talking no sir well keep your mouth still then
now all together again at last carries turn came
it was because of her extreme anxiety to do all that was required that brought on the trouble
she heard some one called
mason said the voice
miss mason she looked around to see who it could be
a girl behind shoved her a little but she did not understand
you you said the manager
cant you hear oh said carrie collapsing and blushing fiercely
isnt your name mason asked the manager
no sir said carrie its madenda well whats the matter with your feet
cant you dance yes sir said carrie who had long since learned this art
why dont you do it then
dont go shuffling along as if you were dead
ive got to have people with life in them carries cheek burned with a crimson heat
her lips trembled a little
yes sir she said
it was this constant urging coupled with irascibility and energy for three long hours
carrie came away worn enough in body but too excited in mind to notice it
she meant to go home and practise her evolutions as prescribed
she would not err in any way if she could help it
when she reached the flat hurstwood was not there
for a wonder he was out looking for work as she supposed
she took only a mouthful to eat and then practised on sustained by visions of freedom from financial distressthe sound of glory ringing in her ears when hurstwood returned he was not so elated as when he went away and now she was obliged to drop practice and get dinner
here was an early irritation
she would have her work and this
was she going to act and keep house
ill not do it she said after i get started
he can take his meals out each day thereafter brought its cares
she found it was not such a wonderful thing to be in the chorus and she also learned that her salary would be twelve dollars a week
after a few days she had her first sight of those high and mightiesthe leading ladies and gentlemen
she saw that they were privileged and deferred to
she was nothingabsolutely nothing at all
at home was hurstwood daily giving her cause for thought
he seemed to get nothing to do and yet he made bold to inquire how she was getting along
the regularity with which he did this smacked of some one who was waiting to live upon her labour
now that she had a visible means of support this irritated her
he seemed to be depending upon her little twelve dollars
how are you getting along he would blandly inquire
oh all right she would reply
find it easy it will be all right when i get used to it his paper would then engross his thoughts
i got some lard he would add as an afterthought
i thought maybe you might want to make some biscuit the calm suggestion of the man astonished her a little especially in the light of recent developments
her dawning independence gave her more courage to observe and she felt as if she wanted to say things
still she could not talk to him as she had to drouet
there was something in the mans manner of which she had always stood in awe
he seemed to have some invisible strength in reserve
one day after her first weeks rehearsal what she expected came openly to the surface
well have to be rather saving he said laying down some meat he had purchased
you wont get any money for a week or so yet no said carrie who was stirring a pan at the stove
ive only got the rent and thirteen dollars more he added
thats it she said to herself
im to use my money now instantly she remembered that she had hoped to buy a few things for herself
she needed clothes
her hat was not nice
what will twelve dollars do towards keeping up this flat she thought
i cant do it
why doesnt he get something to do the important night of the first real performance came
she did not suggest to hurstwood that he come and see
he did not think of going
it would only be money wasted
she had such a small part
the advertisements were already in the papers the posters upon the billboards
the leading lady and many members were cited
carrie was nothing
as in chicago she was seized with stage fright as the very first entrance of the ballet approached but later she recovered
the apparent and painful insignificance of the part took fear away from her
she felt that she was so obscure it did not matter
fortunately she did not have to wear tights
a group of twelve were assigned pretty goldenhued skirts which came only to a line about an inch above the knee
carrie happened to be one of the twelve
in standing about the stage marching and occasionally lifting up her voice in the general chorus she had a chance to observe the audience and to see the inauguration of a great hit
there was plenty of applause but she could not help noting how poorly some of the women of alleged ability did
i could do better than that carrie ventured to herself in several instances
to do her justice she was right
after it was over she dressed quickly and as the manager had scolded some others and passed her she imagined she must have proved satisfactory
she wanted to get out quickly because she knew but few and the stars were gossiping
outside were carriages and some correct youths in attractive clothing waiting
carrie saw that she was scanned closely
the flutter of an eyelash would have brought her a companion
that she did not give
one experienced youth volunteered anyhow
not going home alone are you he said
carrie merely hastened her steps and took the sixth avenue car
her head was so full of the wonder of it that she had time for nothing else
did you hear any more from the brewery she asked at the end of the week hoping by the question to stir him on to action
no he answered theyre not quite ready yet
i think something will come of that though she said nothing more then objecting to giving up her own money and yet feeling that such would have to be the case
hurstwood felt the crisis and artfully decided to appeal to carrie
he had long since realised how goodnatured she was how much she would stand
there was some little shame in him at the thought of doing so but he justified himself with the thought that he really would get something
rent day gave him his opportunity
well he said as he counted it out thats about the last of my money
ill have to get something pretty soon carrie looked at him askance halfsuspicious of an appeal
if i could only hold out a little longer i think i could get something
drake is sure to open a hotel here in september is he said carrie thinking of the short month that still remained until that time
would you mind helping me out until then he said appealingly
i think ill be all right after that time no said carrie feeling sadly handicapped by fate
we can get along if we economise
ill pay you back all right oh ill help you said carrie feeling quite hardhearted at thus forcing him to humbly appeal and yet her desire for the benefit of her earnings wrung a faint protest from her
why dont you take anything george temporarily she said
what difference does it make
maybe after a while youll get something better i will take anything he said relieved and wincing under reproof
id just as leave dig on the streets
nobody knows me here oh you neednt do that said carrie hurt by the pity of it
but there must be other things ill get something he said assuming determination
then he went back to his paper
chapter xxxix
of lights and of shadows the parting of worlds what hurstwood got as the result of this determination was more selfassurance that each particular day was not the day
at the same time carrie passed through thirty days of mental distress
her need of clothesto say nothing of her desire for ornamentsgrew rapidly as the fact developed that for all her work she was not to have them
the sympathy she felt for hurstwood at the time he asked her to tide him over vanished with these newer urgings of decency
he was not always renewing his request but this love of good appearance was
it insisted and carrie wished to satisfy it wished more and more that hurstwood was not in the way
hurstwood reasoned when he neared the last ten dollars that he had better keep a little pocket change and not become wholly dependent for carfare shaves and the like so when this sum was still in his hand he announced himself as penniless
im clear out he said to carrie one afternoon
i paid for some coal this morning and that took all but ten or fifteen cents ive got some money there in my purse hurstwood went to get it starting for a can of tomatoes
carrie scarcely noticed that this was the beginning of the new order
he took out fifteen cents and bought the can with it
thereafter it was dribs and drabs of this sort until one morning carrie suddenly remembered that she would not be back until close to dinner time
were all out of flour she said youd better get some this afternoon
we havent any meat either
how would it do if we had liver and bacon suits me said hurstwood
better get a half or threequarters of a pound of that half ll be enough volunteered hurstwood
she opened her purse and laid down a half dollar
he pretended not to notice it
hurstwood bought the flourwhich all grocers sold in pound packagesfor thirteen cents and paid fifteen cents for a halfpound of liver and bacon
he left the packages together with the balance of twentytwo cents upon the kitchen table where carrie found it
it did not escape her that the change was accurate
there was something sad in realising that after all all that he wanted of her was something to eat
she felt as if hard thoughts were unjust
maybe he would get something yet
he had no vices
that very evening however on going into the theatre one of the chorus girls passed her all newly arrayed in a pretty mottled tweed suit which took carries eye
the young woman wore a fine bunch of violets and seemed in high spirits
she smiled at carrie goodnaturedly as she passed showing pretty even teeth and carrie smiled back
she can afford to dress well thought carrie and so could i if i could only keep my money
i havent a decent tie of any kind to wear she put out her foot and looked at her shoe reflectively
ill get a pair of shoes saturday anyhow i dont care what happens one of the sweetest and most sympathetic little chorus girls in the company made friends with her because in carrie she found nothing to frighten her away
she was a gay little manon unwitting of societys fierce conception of morality but nevertheless good to her neighbour and charitable
little license was allowed the chorus in the matter of conversation but nevertheless some was indulged in
its warm tonight isnt it said this girl arrayed in pink fleshings and an imitation golden helmet
she also carried a shining shield
yes it is said carrie pleased that some one should talk to her
im almost roasting said the girl
carrie looked into her pretty face with its large blue eyes and saw little beads of moisture
theres more marching in this opera than ever i did before added the girl
have you been in others asked carrie surprised at her experience
lots of them said the girl havent you this is my first experience oh is it
i thought i saw you the time they ran the queens mate here no said carrie shaking her head not me this conversation was interrupted by the blare of the orchestra and the sputtering of the calcium lights in the wings as the line was called to form for a new entrance
no further opportunity for conversation occurred but the next evening when they were getting ready for the stage this girl appeared anew at her side
they say this show is going on the road next month is it said carrie
yes do you think youll go i dont know i guess so if theyll take me oh theyll take you
i wouldnt go
they wont give you any more and it will cost you everything you make to live
i never leave new york
there are too many shows going on here can you always get in another show i always have
theres one going on up at the broadway this month
im going to try and get in that if this one really goes carrie heard this with aroused intelligence
evidently it wasnt so very difficult to get on
maybe she also could get a place if this show went away
do they all pay about the same she asked
yes
sometimes you get a little more
this show doesnt pay very much i get twelve said carrie
do you said the girl
they pay me fifteen and you do more work than i do
i wouldnt stand it if i were you
theyre just giving you less because they think you dont know
you ought to be making fifteen well im not said carrie
well youll get more at the next place if you want it went on the girl who admired carrie very much
you do fine and the manager knows it to say the truth carrie did unconsciously move about with an air pleasing and somewhat distinctive
it was due wholly to her natural manner and total lack of selfconsciousness
do you suppose i could get more up at the broadway of course you can answered the girl
you come with me when i go
ill do the talking carrie heard this flushing with thankfulness
she liked this little gaslight soldier
she seemed so experienced and selfreliant in her tinsel helmet and military accoutrements
my future must be assured if i can always get work this way thought carrie
still in the morning when her household duties would infringe upon her and hurstwood sat there a perfect load to contemplate her fate seemed dismal and unrelieved
it did not take so very much to feed them under hurstwoods closemeasured buying and there would possibly be enough for rent but it left nothing else
carrie bought the shoes and some other things which complicated the rent problem very seriously
suddenly a week from the fatal day carrie realised that they were going to run short
i dont believe she exclaimed looking into her purse at breakfast that ill have enough to pay the rent how much have you inquired hurstwood
well ive got twentytwo dollars but theres everything to be paid for this week yet and if i use all i get saturday to pay this there wont be any left for next week
do you think your hotel man will open his hotel this month i think so returned hurstwood
he said he would after a while hurstwood said dont worry about it
maybe the grocer will wait
he can do that
weve traded there long enough to make him trust us for a week or two do you think he will she asked
i think so on this account hurstwood this very day looked grocer oeslogge clearly in the eye as he ordered a pound of coffee and said do you mind carrying my account until the end of every week no no mr wheeler said mr oeslogge
dat iss all right hurstwood still tactful in distress added nothing to this
it seemed an easy thing
he looked out of the door and then gathered up his coffee when ready and came away
the game of a desperate man had begun
rent was paid and now came the grocer
hurstwood managed by paying out of his own ten and collecting from carrie at the end of the week
then he delayed a day next time settling with the grocer and so soon had his ten back with oeslogge getting his pay on this thursday or friday for last saturdays bill
this entanglement made carrie anxious for a change of some sort
hurstwood did not seem to realise that she had a right to anything
he schemed to make what she earned cover all expenses but seemed not to trouble over adding anything himself
he talks about worrying thought carrie
if he worried enough he couldnt sit there and wait for me
hed get something to do
no man could go seven months without finding something if he tried the sight of him always around in his untidy clothes and gloomy appearance drove carrie to seek relief in other places
twice a week there were matines and then hurstwood ate a cold snack which he prepared himself
two other days there were rehearsals beginning at ten in the morning and lasting usually until one
now to this carrie added a few visits to one or two chorus girls including the blueeyed soldier of the golden helmet
she did it because it was pleasant and a relief from dulness of the home over which her husband brooded
the blueeyed soldiers name was osbornelola osborne
her room was in nineteenth street near fourth avenue a block now given up wholly to office buildings
here she had a comfortable back room looking over a collection of back yards in which grew a number of shade trees pleasant to see
isnt your home in new york she asked of lola one day
yes but i cant get along with my people
they always want me to do what they want
do you live here yes said carrie
with your family carrie was ashamed to say that she was married
she had talked so much about getting more salary and confessed to so much anxiety about her future that now when the direct question of fact was waiting she could not tell this girl
with some relatives she answered
miss osborne took it for granted that like herself carries time was her own
she invariably asked her to stay proposing little outings and other things of that sort until carrie began neglecting her dinner hours
hurstwood noticed it but felt in no position to quarrel with her
several times she came so late as scarcely to have an hour in which to patch up a meal and start for the theatre
do you rehearse in the afternoons hurstwood once asked concealing almost completely the cynical protest and regret which prompted it
no i was looking around for another place said carrie
as a matter of fact she was but only in such a way as furnished the least straw of an excuse
miss osborne and she had gone to the office of the manager who was to produce the new opera at the broadway and returned straight to the formers room where they had been since three oclock
carrie felt this question to be an infringement on her liberty
she did not take into account how much liberty she was securing
only the latest step the newest freedom must not be questioned
hurstwood saw it all clearly enough
he was shrewd after his kind and yet there was enough decency in the man to stop him from making any effectual protest
in his almost inexplicable apathy he was content to droop supinely while carrie drifted out of his life just as he was willing supinely to see opportunity pass beyond his control
he could not help clinging and protesting in a mild irritating and ineffectual way howevera way that simply widened the breach by slow degrees
a further enlargement of this chasm between them came when the manager looking between the wings upon the brightly lighted stage where the chorus was going through some of its glittering evolutions said to the master of the ballet who is that fourth girl there on the rightthe one coming round at the end now oh said the balletmaster thats miss madenda shes good looking
why dont you let her head that line i will said the man
just do that
shell look better there than the woman youve got all right
i will do that said the master
the next evening carrie was called out much as if for an error
you lead your company tonight said the master
yes sir said carrie
put snap into it he added
we must have snap yes sir replied carrie
astonished at this change she thought that the heretofore leader must be ill but when she saw her in the line with a distinct expression of something unfavourable in her eye she began to think that perhaps it was merit
she had a chic way of tossing her head to one side and holding her arms as if for actionnot listlessly
in front of the line this showed up even more effectually
that girl knows how to carry herself said the manager another evening
he began to think that he should like to talk with her
if he hadnt made it a rule to have nothing to do with the members of the chorus he would have approached her most unbendingly
put that girl at the head of the white column he suggested to the man in charge of the ballet
this white column consisted of some twenty girls all in snowwhite flannel trimmed with silver and blue
its leader was most stunningly arrayed in the same colours elaborated however with epaulets and a belt of silver with a short sword dangling at one side
carrie was fitted for this costume and a few days later appeared proud of her new laurels
she was especially gratified to find that her salary was now eighteen instead of twelve
hurstwood heard nothing about this
ill not give him the rest of my money said carrie
i do enough
i am going to get me something to wear as a matter of fact during this second month she had been buying for herself as recklessly as she dared regardless of the consequences
there were impending more complications rent day and more extension of the credit system in the neighbourhood
now however she proposed to do better by herself
her first move was to buy a shirt waist and in studying these she found how little her money would buyhow much if she could only use all
she forgot that if she were alone she would have to pay for a room and board and imagined that every cent of her eighteen could be spent for clothes and things that she liked
at last she picked upon something which not only used up all her surplus above twelve but invaded that sum
she knew she was going too far but her feminine love of finery prevailed
the next day hurstwood said we owe the grocer five dollars and forty cents this week do we said carrie frowning a little
she looked in her purse to leave it
ive only got eight dollars and twenty cents altogether we owe the milkman sixty cents added hurstwood
yes and theres the coal man said carrie
hurstwood said nothing
he had seen the new things she was buying the way she was neglecting household duties the readiness with which she was slipping out afternoons and staying
he felt that something was going to happen
all at once she spoke i dont know she said i cant do it all
i dont earn enough this was a direct challenge
hurstwood had to take it up
he tried to be calm
i dont want you to do it all he said
i only want a little help until i can get something to do oh yes answered carrie
thats always the way
it takes more than i can earn to pay for things
i dont see what im going to do
well ive tried to get something he exclaimed
what do you want me to do you couldnt have tried so very hard said carrie
i got something well i did he said angered almost to harsh words
you neednt throw up your success to me
all i asked was a little help until i could get something
im not down yet
ill come up all right he tried to speak steadily but his voice trembled a little
carries anger melted on the instant
she felt ashamed
well she said heres the money and emptied it out on the table
i havent got quite enough to pay it all
if they can wait until saturday though ill have some more you keep it said hurstwood sadly
i only want enough to pay the grocer she put it back and proceeded to get dinner early and in good time
her little bravado made her feel as if she ought to make amends
in a little while their old thoughts returned to both
shes making more than she says thought hurstwood
she says shes making twelve but that wouldnt buy all those things
i dont care
let her keep her money
ill get something again one of these days
then she can go to the deuce he only said this in his anger but it prefigured a possible course of action and attitude well enough
i dont care thought carrie
he ought to be told to get out and do something
it isnt right that i should support him in these days carrie was introduced to several youths friends of miss osborne who were of the kind most aptly described as gay and festive
they called once to get miss osborne for an afternoon drive
carrie was with her at the time
come and go along said lola
no i cant said carrie
oh yes come and go
what have you got to do i have to be home by five said carrie
what for oh dinner theyll take us to dinner said lola
oh no said carrie
i wont go
i cant oh do come
theyre awful nice boys
well get you back in time
were only going for a drive in central park carrie thought a while and at last yielded
now i must be back by halfpast four she said
the information went in one ear of lola and out the other
after drouet and hurstwood there was the least touch of cynicism in her attitude toward young menespecially of the gay and frivolous sort
she felt a little older than they
some of their pretty compliments seemed silly
still she was young in heart and body and youth appealed to her
oh well be right back miss madenda said one of the chaps bowing
you wouldnt think wed keep you over time now would you well i dont know said carrie smiling
they were off for a driveshe looking about and noticing fine clothing the young men voicing those silly pleasantries and weak quips which pass for humour in coy circles
carrie saw the great park parade of carriages beginning at the fiftyninth street entrance and winding past the museum of art to the exit at one hundred and tenth street and seventh avenue
her eye was once more taken by the show of wealththe elaborate costumes elegant harnesses spirited horses and above all the beauty
once more the plague of poverty galled her but now she forgot in a measure her own troubles so far as to forget hurstwood
he waited until four five and even six
it was getting dark when he got up out of his chair
i guess she isnt coming home he said grimly
thats the way he thought
shes getting a start now
im out of it carrie had really discovered her neglect but only at a quarter after five and the open carriage was now far up seventh avenue near the harlem river
what time is it she inquired
i must be getting back a quarter after five said her companion consulting an elegant openfaced watch
oh dear me exclaimed carrie
then she settled back with a sigh
theres no use crying over spilt milk she said
its too late of course it is said the youth who saw visions of a fine dinner now and such invigorating talk as would result in a reunion after the show
he was greatly taken with carrie
well drive down to delmonicos now and have something there wont we orrin to be sure replied orrin gaily
carrie thought of hurstwood
never before had she neglected dinner without an excuse
they drove back and at sat down to dine
it was the sherry incident over again the remembrance of which came painfully back to carrie
she remembered mrs vance who had never called again after hurstwoods reception and ames
at this figure her mind halted
it was a strong clean vision
he liked better books than she read better people than she associated with
his ideals burned in her heart
its fine to be a good actress came distinctly back
what sort of an actress was she
what are you thinking about miss madenda inquired her merry companion
come now lets see if i can guess oh no said carrie
dont try she shook it off and ate
she forgot in part and was merry
when it came to the aftertheatre proposition however she shook her head
no she said i cant
i have a previous engagement oh now miss madenda pleaded the youth
no said carrie i cant
youve been so kind but youll have to excuse me the youth looked exceedingly crestfallen
cheer up old man whispered his companion
well go around anyhow
she may change her mind chapter xl
a public dissension a final appeal there was no aftertheatre lark however so far as carrie was concerned
she made her way homeward thinking about her absence
hurstwood was asleep but roused up to look as she passed through to her own bed
is that you he said
yes she answered
the next morning at breakfast she felt like apologising
i couldnt get home last evening she said
ah carrie he answered whats the use saying that
i dont care
you neednt tell me that though i couldnt said carrie her colour rising
then seeing that he looked as if he said i know she exclaimed oh all right
i dont care from now on her indifference to the flat was even greater
there seemed no common ground on which they could talk to one another
she let herself be asked for expenses
it became so with him that he hated to do it
he preferred standing off the butcher and baker
he ran up a grocery bill of sixteen dollars with oeslogge laying in a supply of staple articles so that they would not have to buy any of those things for some time to come
then he changed his grocery
it was the same with the butcher and several others
carrie never heard anything of this directly from him
he asked for such as he could expect drifting farther and farther into a situation which could have but one ending
in this fashion september went by
isnt mr drake going to open his hotel carrie asked several times
yes
he wont do it before october though now carrie became disgusted
such a man she said to herself frequently
more and more she visited
she put most of her spare money in clothes which after all was not an astonishing amount
at last the opera she was with announced its departure within four weeks
last two weeks of the great comic opera successthe etc was upon all billboards and in the newspapers before she acted
im not going out on the road said miss osborne
carrie went with her to apply to another manager
ever had any experience was one of his questions
im with the company at the casino now oh you are he said
the end of this was another engagement at twenty per week
carrie was delighted
she began to feel that she had a place in the world
people recognised ability
so changed was her state that the home atmosphere became intolerable
it was all poverty and trouble there or seemed to be because it was a load to bear
it became a place to keep away from
still she slept there and did a fair amount of work keeping it in order
it was a sitting place for hurstwood
he sat and rocked rocked and read enveloped in the gloom of his own fate
october went by and november
it was the dead of winter almost before he knew it and there he sat
carrie was doing better that he knew
her clothes were improved now even fine
he saw her coming and going sometimes picturing to himself her rise
little eating had thinned him somewhat
he had no appetite
his clothes too were a poor mans clothes
talk about getting something had become even too threadbare and ridiculous for him
so he folded his hands and waitedfor what he could not anticipate
at last however troubles became too thick
the hounding of creditors the indifference of carrie the silence of the flat and presence of winter all joined to produce a climax
it was effected by the arrival of oeslogge personally when carrie was there
i call about my bill said mr oeslogge
carrie was only faintly surprised
how much is it she asked
sixteen dollars he replied
oh that much said carrie
is this right she asked turning to hurstwood
yes he said
well i never heard anything about it she looked as if she thought he had been contracting some needless expense
well we had it all right he answered
then he went to the door
i cant pay you anything on that today he said mildly
well when can you said the grocer
not before saturday anyhow said hurstwood
huh returned the grocer
this is fine
i must have that
i need the money carrie was standing farther back in the room hearing it all
she was greatly distressed
it was so bad and commonplace
hurstwood was annoyed also
well he said theres no use talking about it now
if youll come in saturday ill pay you something on it the grocery man went away
how are we going to pay it asked carrie astonished by the bill
i cant do it well you dont have to he said
he cant get what he cant get
hell have to wait i dont see how we ran up such a bill as that said carrie
well we ate it said hurstwood
its funny she replied still doubting
whats the use of your standing there and talking like that now he asked
do you think ive had it alone
you talk as if id taken something well its too much anyhow said carrie
i oughtnt to be made to pay for it
ive got more than i can pay for now all right replied hurstwood sitting down in silence
he was sick of the grind of this thing
carrie went out and there he sat determining to do something
there had been appearing in the papers about this time rumours and notices of an approaching strike on the trolley lines in brooklyn
there was general dissatisfaction as to the hours of labour required and the wages paid
as usualand for some inexplicable reasonthe men chose the winter for the forcing of the hand of their employers and the settlement of their difficulties
hurstwood had been reading of this thing and wondering concerning the huge tieup which would follow
a day or two before this trouble with carrie it came
on a cold afternoon when everything was grey and it threatened to snow the papers announced that the men had been called out on all the lines
being so utterly idle and his mind filled with the numerous predictions which had been made concerning the scarcity of labour this winter and the panicky state of the financial market hurstwood read this with interest
he noted the claims of the striking motormen and conductors who said that they had been wont to receive two dollars a day in times past but that for a year or more trippers had been introduced which cut down their chance of livelihood onehalf and increased their hours of servitude from ten to twelve and even fourteen
these trippers were men put on during the busy and rush hours to take a car out for one trip
the compensation paid for such a trip was only twentyfive cents
when the rush or busy hours were over they were laid off
worst of all no man might know when he was going to get a car
he must come to the barns in the morning and wait around in fair and foul weather until such time as he was needed
two trips were an average reward for so much waitinga little over three hours work for fifty cents
the work of waiting was not counted
the men complained that this system was extending and that the time was not far off when but a few out of employees would have regular twodollaraday work at all
they demanded that the system be abolished and that ten hours be considered a days work barring unavoidable delays with pay
they demanded immediate acceptance of these terms which the various trolley companies refused
hurstwood at first sympathised with the demands of these menindeed it is a question whether he did not always sympathise with them to the end belie him as his actions might
reading nearly all the news he was attracted first by the scareheads with which the trouble was noted in the world he read it fullythe names of the seven companies involved the number of men
theyre foolish to strike in this sort of weather he thought to himself
let em win if they can though the next day there was even a larger notice of it
brooklynites walk said the world knights of labour tie up the trolley lines across the bridge about seven thousand men out hurstwood read this formulating to himself his own idea of what would be the outcome
he was a great believer in the strength of corporations
they cant win he said concerning the men
they havent any money
the police will protect the companies
theyve got to
the public has to have its cars he didnt sympathise with the corporations but strength was with them
so was property and public utility
those fellows cant win he thought
among other things he noticed a circular issued by one of the companies which read atlantic avenue railroad special notice the motormen and conductors and other employees of this company having abruptly left its service an opportunity is now given to all loyal men who have struck against their will to be reinstated providing they will make their applications by twelve oclock noon on wednesday january th
such men will be given employment with guaranteed protection in the order in which such applications are received and runs and positions assigned them accordingly
otherwise they will be considered discharged and every vacancy will be filled by a new man as soon as his services can be secured
signed benjamin norton president he also noted among the want ads
one which read wanted skilled motormen accustomed to westinghouse system to run us mail cars only in the city of brooklyn protection guaranteed
he noted particularly in each the protection guaranteed it signified to him the unassailable power of the companies
theyve got the militia on their side he thought
there isnt anything those men can do while this was still in his mind the incident with oeslogge and carrie occurred
there had been a good deal to irritate him but this seemed much the worst
never before had she accused him of stealingor very near that
she doubted the naturalness of so large a bill
and he had worked so hard to make expenses seem light
he had been doing butcher and baker in order not to call on her
he had eaten very littlealmost nothing
damn it all he said
i can get something
im not down yet he thought that he really must do something now
it was too cheap to sit around after such an insinuation as this
why after a little he would be standing anything
he got up and looked out the window into the chilly street
it came gradually into his mind as he stood there to go to brooklyn
why not his mind said
any one can get work over there
youll get two a day how about accidents said a voice
you might get hurt oh there wont be much of that he answered
theyve called out the police
any one who wants to run a car will be protected all right you dont know how to run a car rejoined the voice
i wont apply as a motorman he answered
i can ring up fares all right theyll want motormen mostly theyll take anybody that i know for several hours he argued pro and con with this mental counsellor feeling no need to act at once in a matter so sure of profit
in the morning he put on his best clothes which were poor enough and began stirring about putting some bread and meat into a page of a newspaper
carrie watched him interested in this new move
where are you going she asked
over to brooklyn he answered
then seeing her still inquisitive he added i think i can get on over there on the trolley lines said carrie astonished
yes he rejoined
arent you afraid she asked
what of he answered
the police are protecting them the paper said four men were hurt yesterday yes he returned but you cant go by what the papers say
theyll run the cars all right he looked rather determined now in a desolate sort of way and carrie felt very sorry
something of the old hurstwood was herethe least shadow of what was once shrewd and pleasant strength
outside it was cloudy and blowing a few flakes of snow
what a day to go over there thought carrie
now he left before she did which was a remarkable thing and tramped eastward to fourteenth street and sixth avenue where he took the car
he had read that scores of applicants were applying at the office of the brooklyn city railroad building and were being received
he made his way there by horsecar and ferrya dark silent manto the offices in question
it was a long way for no cars were running and the day was cold but he trudged along grimly
once in brooklyn he could clearly see and feel that a strike was on
people showed it in their manner
along the routes of certain tracks not a car was running
about certain corners and nearby saloons small groups of men were lounging
several spring wagons passed him equipped with plain wooden chairs and labelled flatbush or prospect park
fare ten cents he noticed cold and even gloomy faces
labour was having its little war
when he came near the office in question he saw a few men standing about and some policemen
on the far corners were other menwhom he took to be strikerswatching
all the houses were small and wooden the streets poorly paved
after new york brooklyn looked actually poor and hardup
he made his way into the heart of the small group eyed by policemen and the men already there
one of the officers addressed him
what are you looking for i want to see if i can get a place the offices are up those steps said the bluecoat
his face was a very neutral thing to contemplate
in his heart of hearts he sympathised with the strikers and hated this scab in his heart of hearts also he felt the dignity and use of the police force which commanded order
of its true social significance he never once dreamed
his was not the mind for that
the two feelings blended in himneutralised one another and him
he would have fought for this man as determinedly as for himself and yet only so far as commanded
strip him of his uniform and he would have soon picked his side
hurstwood ascended a dusty flight of steps and entered a small dustcoloured office in which were a railing a long desk and several clerks
well sir said a middleaged man looking up at him from the long desk
do you want to hire any men inquired hurstwood
what are youa motorman no im not anything said hurstwood
he was not at all abashed by his position
he knew these people needed men
if one didnt take him another would
this man could take him or leave him just as he chose
well we prefer experienced men of course said the man
he paused while hurstwood smiled indifferently
then he added still i guess you can learn
what is your name wheeler said hurstwood
the man wrote an order on a small card
take that to our barns he said and give it to the foreman
hell show you what to do hurstwood went down and out
he walked straight away in the direction indicated while the policemen looked after
theres another wants to try it said officer kiely to officer macey
i have my mind hell get his fill returned the latter quietly
they had been in strikes before
chapter xli
the strike the barn at which hurstwood applied was exceedingly shorthanded and was being operated practically by three men as directors
there were a lot of green hands aroundqueer hungrylooking men who looked as if want had driven them to desperate means
they tried to be lively and willing but there was an air of hangdog diffidence about the place
hurstwood went back through the barns and out into a large enclosed lot where were a series of tracks and loops
a halfdozen cars were there manned by instructors each with a pupil at the lever
more pupils were waiting at one of the rear doors of the barn
in silence hurstwood viewed this scene and waited
his companions took his eye for a while though they did not interest him much more than the cars
they were an uncomfortablelooking gang however
one or two were very thin and lean
several were quite stout
several others were rawboned and sallow as if they had been beaten upon by all sorts of rough weather
did you see by the paper they are going to call out the militia hurstwood heard one of them remark
oh theyll do that returned the other
they always do think were liable to have much trouble said another whom hurstwood did not see
not very that scotchman that went out on the last car put in a voice told me that they hit him in the ear with a cinder a small nervous laugh accompanied this
one of those fellows on the fifth avenue line must have had a hell of a time according to the papers drawled another
they broke his car windows and pulled him off into the street fore the police could stop em yes but there are more police around today was added by another
hurstwood hearkened without much mental comment
these talkers seemed scared to him
their gabbling was feverishthings said to quiet their own minds
he looked out into the yard and waited
two of the men got around quite near him but behind his back
they were rather social and he listened to what they said
are you a railroad man said one
me
no
ive always worked in a paper factory i had a job in newark until last october returned the other with reciprocal feeling
there were some words which passed too low to hear
then the conversation became strong again
i dont blame these fellers for striking said one
theyve got the right of it all right but i had to get something to do same here said the other
if i had any job in newark i wouldnt be over here takin chances like these its hell these days aint it said the man
a poor man aint nowhere
you could starve by god right in the streets and there aint most no one would help you right you are said the other
the job i had i lost cause they shut down
they run all summer and lay up a big stock and then shut down hurstwood paid some little attention to this
somehow he felt a little superior to these twoa little better off
to him these were ignorant and commonplace poor sheep in a drivers hand
poor devils he thought speaking out of the thoughts and feelings of a bygone period of success
next said one of the instructors
youre next said a neighbour touching him
he went out and climbed on the platform
the instructor took it for granted that no preliminaries were needed
you see this handle he said reaching up to an electric cutoff which was fastened to the roof
this throws the current off or on
if you want to reverse the car you turn it over here
if you want to send it forward you put it over here
if you want to cut off the power you keep it in the middle hurstwood smiled at the simple information
now this handle here regulates your speed
to here he said pointing with his finger gives you about four miles an hour
this is eight
when its full on you make about fourteen miles an hour hurstwood watched him calmly
he had seen motormen work before
he knew just about how they did it and was sure he could do as well with a very little practice
the instructor explained a few more details and then said now well back her up hurstwood stood placidly by while the car rolled back into the yard
one thing you want to be careful about and that is to start easy
give one degree time to act before you start another
the one fault of most men is that they always want to throw her wide open
thats bad
its dangerous too
wears out the motor
you dont want to do that i see said hurstwood
he waited and waited while the man talked on
now you take it he said finally
the exmanager laid hand to the lever and pushed it gently as he thought
it worked much easier than he imagined however with the result that the car jerked quickly forward throwing him back against the door
he straightened up sheepishly while the instructor stopped the car with the brake
you want to be careful about that was all he said
hurstwood found however that handling a brake and regulating speed were not so instantly mastered as he had imagined
once or twice he would have ploughed through the rear fence if it had not been for the hand and word of his companion
the latter was rather patient with him but he never smiled
youve got to get the knack of working both arms at once he said
it takes a little practice one oclock came while he was still on the car practising and he began to feel hungry
the day set in snowing and he was cold
he grew weary of running to and fro on the short track
they ran the car to the end and both got off
hurstwood went into the barn and sought a car step pulling out his paperwrapped lunch from his pocket
there was no water and the bread was dry but he enjoyed it
there was no ceremony about dining
he swallowed and looked about contemplating the dull homely labour of the thing
it was disagreeablemiserably disagreeablein all its phases
not because it was bitter but because it was hard
it would be hard to any one he thought
after eating he stood about as before waiting until his turn came
the intention was to give him an afternoon of practice but the greater part of the time was spent in waiting about
at last evening came and with it hunger and a debate with himself as to how he should spend the night
it was halfpast five
he must soon eat
if he tried to go home it would take him two hours and a half of cold walking and riding
besides he had orders to report at seven the next morning and going home would necessitate his rising at an unholy and disagreeable hour
he had only something like a dollar and fifteen cents of carries money with which he had intended to pay the two weeks coal bill before the present idea struck him
they must have some place around here he thought
where does that fellow from newark stay finally he decided to ask
there was a young fellow standing near one of the doors in the cold waiting a last turn
he was a mere boy in yearstwentyone aboutbut with a body lank and long because of privation
a little good living would have made this youth plump and swaggering
how do they arrange this if a man hasnt any money inquired hurstwood discreetly
the fellow turned a keen watchful face on the inquirer
you mean eat he replied
yes and sleep
i cant go back to new york tonight the foreman ll fix that if you ask him i guess
he did me that so yes
i just told him i didnt have anything
gee i couldnt go home
i live way over in hoboken hurstwood only cleared his throat by way of acknowledgment
theyve got a place upstairs here i understand
i dont know what sort of a thing it is
purty tough i guess
he gave me a meal ticket this noon
i know that wasnt much hurstwood smiled grimly and the boy laughed
it aint no fun is it he inquired wishing vainly for a cheery reply
not much answered hurstwood
id tackle him now volunteered the youth
he may go way hurstwood did so
isnt there some place i can stay around here tonight he inquired
if i have to go back to new york im afraid i wont therere some cots upstairs interrupted the man if you want one of them thatll do he assented
he meant to ask for a meal ticket but the seemingly proper moment never came and he decided to pay himself that night
ill ask him in the morning he ate in a cheap restaurant in the vicinity and being cold and lonely went straight off to seek the loft in question
the company was not attempting to run cars after nightfall
it was so advised by the police
the room seemed to have been a lounging place for night workers
there were some nine cots in the place two or three wooden chairs a soap box and a small roundbellied stove in which a fire was blazing
early as he was another man was there before him
the latter was sitting beside the stove warming his hands
hurstwood approached and held out his own toward the fire
he was sick of the bareness and privation of all things connected with his venture but was steeling himself to hold out
he fancied he could for a while
cold isnt it said the early guest
rather a long silence
not much of a place to sleep in is it said the man
better than nothing replied hurstwood
another silence
i believe ill turn in said the man
rising he went to one of the cots and stretched himself removing only his shoes and pulling the one blanket and dirty old comforter over him in a sort of bundle
the sight disgusted hurstwood but he did not dwell on it choosing to gaze into the stove and think of something else
presently he decided to retire and picked a cot also removing his shoes
while he was doing so the youth who had advised him to come here entered and seeing hurstwood tried to be genial
bettern nothin he observed looking around
hurstwood did not take this to himself
he thought it to be an expression of individual satisfaction and so did not answer
the youth imagined he was out of sorts and set to whistling softly
seeing another man asleep he quit that and lapsed into silence
hurstwood made the best of a bad lot by keeping on his clothes and pushing away the dirty covering from his head but at last he dozed in sheer weariness
the covering became more and more comfortable its character was forgotten and he pulled it about his neck and slept
in the morning he was aroused out of a pleasant dream by several men stirring about in the cold cheerless room
he had been back in chicago in fancy in his own comfortable home
jessica had been arranging to go somewhere and he had been talking with her about it
this was so clear in his mind that he was startled now by the contrast of this room
he raised his head and the cold bitter reality jarred him into wakefulness
guess id better get up he said
there was no water on this floor
he put on his shoes in the cold and stood up shaking himself in his stiffness
his clothes felt disagreeable his hair bad
hell he muttered as he put on his hat
downstairs things were stirring again
he found a hydrant with a trough which had once been used for horses but there was no towel here and his handkerchief was soiled from yesterday
he contented himself with wetting his eyes with the icecold water
then he sought the foreman who was already on the ground
had your breakfast yet inquired that worthy
no said hurstwood
better get it then your car wont be ready for a little while hurstwood hesitated
could you let me have a meal ticket he asked with an effort
here you are said the man handing him one
he breakfasted as poorly as the night before on some fried steak and bad coffee
then he went back
here said the foreman motioning him when he came in
you take this car out in a few minutes hurstwood climbed up on the platform in the gloomy barn and waited for a signal
he was nervous and yet the thing was a relief
anything was better than the barn
on this the fourth day of the strike the situation had taken a turn for the worse
the strikers following the counsel of their leaders and the newspapers had struggled peaceably enough
there had been no great violence done
cars had been stopped it is true and the men argued with
some crews had been won over and led away some windows broken some jeering and yelling done but in no more than five or six instances had men been seriously injured
these by crowds whose acts the leaders disclaimed
idleness however and the sight of the company backed by the police triumphing angered the men
they saw that each day more cars were going on each day more declarations were being made by the company officials that the effective opposition of the strikers was broken
this put desperate thoughts in the minds of the men
peaceful methods meant they saw that the companies would soon run all their cars and those who had complained would be forgotten
there was nothing so helpful to the companies as peaceful methods
all at once they blazed forth and for a week there was storm and stress
cars were assailed men attacked policemen struggled with tracks torn up and shots fired until at last street fights and mob movements became frequent and the city was invested with militia
hurstwood knew nothing of the change of temper
run your car out called the foreman waving a vigorous hand at him
a green conductor jumped up behind and rang the bell twice as a signal to start
hurstwood turned the lever and ran the car out through the door into the street in front of the barn
here two brawny policemen got up beside him on the platformone on either hand
at the sound of a gong near the barn door two bells were given by the conductor and hurstwood opened his lever
the two policemen looked about them calmly
tis cold all right this morning said the one on the left who possessed a rich brogue
i had enough of it yesterday said the other
i wouldnt want a steady job of this nor i neither paid the slightest attention to hurstwood who stood facing the cold wind which was chilling him completely and thinking of his orders
keep a steady gait the foreman had said
dont stop for any one who doesnt look like a real passenger
whatever you do dont stop for a crowd the two officers kept silent for a few moments
the last man must have gone through all right said the officer on the left
i dont see his car anywhere whos on there asked the second officer referring of course to its complement of policemen
schaeffer and ryan there was another silence in which the car ran smoothly along
there were not so many houses along this part of the way
hurstwood did not see many people either
the situation was not wholly disagreeable to him
if he were not so cold he thought he would do well enough
he was brought out of this feeling by the sudden appearance of a curve ahead which he had not expected
he shut off the current and did an energetic turn at the brake but not in time to avoid an unnaturally quick turn
it shook him up and made him feel like making some apologetic remarks but he refrained
you want to look out for them things said the officer on the left condescendingly
thats right agreed hurstwood shamefacedly
theres lots of them on this line said the officer on the right
around the corner a more populated way appeared
one or two pedestrians were in view ahead
a boy coming out of a gate with a tin milk bucket gave hurstwood his first objectionable greeting
scab he yelled
scab hurstwood heard it but tried to make no comment even to himself
he knew he would get that and much more of the same sort probably
at a corner farther up a man stood by the track and signalled the car to stop
never mind him said one of the officers
hes up to some game hurstwood obeyed
at the corner he saw the wisdom of it
no sooner did the man perceive the intention to ignore him than he shook his fist
ah you bloody coward he yelled
some half dozen men standing on the corner flung taunts and jeers after the speeding car
hurstwood winced the least bit
the real thing was slightly worse than the thoughts of it had been
now came in sight three or four blocks farther on a heap of something on the track
theyve been at work here all right said one of the policemen
well have an argument maybe said the other
hurstwood ran the car close and stopped
he had not done so wholly however before a crowd gathered about
it was composed of exmotormen and conductors in part with a sprinkling of friends and sympathisers
come off the car pardner said one of the men in a voice meant to be conciliatory
you dont want to take the bread out of another mans mouth do you hurstwood held to his brake and lever pale and very uncertain what to do
stand back yelled one of the officers leaning over the platform railing
clear out of this now
give the man a chance to do his work listen pardner said the leader ignoring the policeman and addressing hurstwood
were all working men like yourself
if you were a regular motorman and had been treated as weve been you wouldnt want any one to come in and take your place would you
you wouldnt want any one to do you out of your chance to get your rights would you shut her off
shut her off urged the other of the policemen roughly
get out of this now and he jumped the railing and landed before the crowd and began shoving
instantly the other officer was down beside him
stand back now they yelled
get out of this
what the hell do you mean
out now it was like a small swarm of bees
dont shove me said one of the strikers determinedly
im not doing anything get out of this cried the officer swinging his club
ill give ye a bat on the sconce
back now what the hell cried another of the strikers pushing the other way adding at the same time some lusty oaths
crack came an officers club on his forehead
he blinked his eyes blindly a few times wabbled on his legs threw up his hands and staggered back
in return a swift fist landed on the officers neck
infuriated by this the latter plunged left and right laying about madly with his club
he was ably assisted by his brother of the blue who poured ponderous oaths upon the troubled waters
no severe damage was done owing to the agility of the strikers in keeping out of reach
they stood about the sidewalk now and jeered
where is the conductor yelled one of the officers getting his eye on that individual who had come nervously forward to stand by hurstwood
the latter had stood gazing upon the scene with more astonishment than fear
why dont you come down here and get these stones off the track inquired the officer
what you standing there for
do you want to stay here all day
get down hurstwood breathed heavily in excitement and jumped down with the nervous conductor as if he had been called
hurry up now said the other policeman
cold as it was these officers were hot and mad
hurstwood worked with the conductor lifting stone after stone and warming himself by the work
ah you scab you yelled the crowd
you coward
steal a mans job will you
rob the poor will you you thief
well get you yet now
wait not all of this was delivered by one man
it came from here and there incorporated with much more of the same sort and curses
work you blackguards yelled a voice
do the dirty work
youre the suckers that keep the poor people down may god starve ye yet yelled an old irish woman who now threw open a nearby window and stuck out her head
yes and you she added catching the eye of one of the policemen
you bloody murtherin thafe
crack my son over the head will you you hardhearted murtherin divil
ah ye but the officer turned a deaf ear
go to the devil you old hag he half muttered as he stared round upon the scattered company
now the stones were off and hurstwood took his place again amid a continued chorus of epithets
both officers got up beside him and the conductor rang the bell when bang
bang
through window and door came rocks and stones
one narrowly grazed hurstwoods head
another shattered the window behind
throw open your lever yelled one of the officers grabbing at the handle himself
hurstwood complied and the car shot away followed by a rattle of stones and a rain of curses
that hit me in the neck said one of the officers
i gave him a good crack for it though i think i must have left spots on some of them said the other
i know that big guy that called us a said the first
ill get him yet for that i thought we were in for it sure once there said the second
hurstwood warmed and excited gazed steadily ahead
it was an astonishing experience for him
he had read of these things but the reality seemed something altogether new
he was no coward in spirit
the fact that he had suffered this much now rather operated to arouse a stolid determination to stick it out
he did not recur in thought to new york or the flat
this one trip seemed a consuming thing
they now ran into the business heart of brooklyn uninterrupted
people gazed at the broken windows of the car and at hurstwood in his plain clothes
voices called scab now and then as well as other epithets but no crowd attacked the car
at the downtown end of the line one of the officers went to call up his station and report the trouble
theres a gang out there he said laying for us yet
better send some one over there and clean them out the car ran back more quietlyhooted watched flung at but not attacked
hurstwood breathed freely when he saw the barns
well he observed to himself i came out of that all right the car was turned in and he was allowed to loaf a while but later he was again called
this time a new team of officers was aboard
slightly more confident he sped the car along the commonplace streets and felt somewhat less fearful
on one side however he suffered intensely
the day was raw with a sprinkling of snow and a gusty wind made all the more intolerable by the speed of the car
his clothing was not intended for this sort of work
he shivered stamped his feet and beat his arms as he had seen other motormen do in the past but said nothing
the novelty and danger of the situation modified in a way his disgust and distress at being compelled to be here but not enough to prevent him from feeling grim and sour
this was a dogs life he thought
it was a tough thing to have to come to
the one thought that strengthened him was the insult offered by carrie
he was not down so low as to take all that he thought
he could do somethingthis evenfor a while
it would get better
he would save a little
a boy threw a clod of mud while he was thus reflecting and hit him upon the arm
it hurt sharply and angered him more than he had been any time since morning
the little cur he muttered
hurt you asked one of the policemen
no he answered
at one of the corners where the car slowed up because of a turn an exmotorman standing on the sidewalk called to him wont you come out pardner and be a man
remember were fighting for decent days wages thats all
weve got families to support the man seemed most peaceably inclined
hurstwood pretended not to see him
he kept his eyes straight on before and opened the lever wide
the voice had something appealing in it
all morning this went on and long into the afternoon
he made three such trips
the dinner he had was no stay for such work and the cold was telling on him
at each end of the line he stopped to thaw out but he could have groaned at the anguish of it
one of the barnmen out of pity loaned him a heavy cap and a pair of sheepskin gloves and for once he was extremely thankful
on the second trip of the afternoon he ran into a crowd about half way along the line that had blocked the cars progress with an old telegraph pole
get that thing off the track shouted the two policemen
yah yah yah yelled the crowd
get it off yourself the two policemen got down and hurstwood started to follow
you stay there one called
some one will run away with your car amid the babel of voices hurstwood heard one close beside him
come down pardner and be a man
dont fight the poor
leave that to the corporations he saw the same fellow who had called to him from the corner
now as before he pretended not to hear him
come down the man repeated gently
you dont want to fight poor men
dont fight at all it was a most philosophic and jesuitical motorman
a third policeman joined the other two from somewhere and some one ran to telephone for more officers
hurstwood gazed about determined but fearful
a man grabbed him by the coat
come off of that he exclaimed jerking at him and trying to pull him over the railing
let go said hurstwood savagely
ill show youyou scab cried a young irishman jumping up on the car and aiming a blow at hurstwood
the latter ducked and caught it on the shoulder instead of the jaw
away from here shouted an officer hastening to the rescue and adding of course the usual oaths
hurstwood recovered himself pale and trembling
it was becoming serious with him now
people were looking up and jeering at him
one girl was making faces
he began to waver in his resolution when a patrol wagon rolled up and more officers dismounted
now the track was quickly cleared and the release effected
let her go now quick said the officer and again he was off
the end came with a real mob which met the car on its return trip a mile or two from the barns
it was an exceedingly poorlooking neighbourhood
he wanted to run fast through it but again the track was blocked
he saw men carrying something out to it when he was yet a halfdozen blocks away
there they are again exclaimed one policeman
ill give them something this time said the second officer whose patience was becoming worn
hurstwood suffered a qualm of body as the car rolled up
as before the crowd began hooting but now rather than come near they threw things
one or two windows were smashed and hurstwood dodged a stone
both policemen ran out toward the crowd but the latter replied by running toward the car
a womana mere girl in appearancewas among these bearing a rough stick
she was exceedingly wrathful and struck at hurstwood who dodged
thereupon her companions duly encouraged jumped on the car and pulled hurstwood over
he had hardly time to speak or shout before he fell
let go of me he said falling on his side
ah you sucker he heard some one say
kicks and blows rained on him
he seemed to be suffocating
then two men seemed to be dragging him off and he wrestled for freedom
let up said a voice youre all right
stand up he was let loose and recovered himself
now he recognised two officers
he felt as if he would faint from exhaustion
something was wet on his chin
he put up his hand and felt then looked
it was red
they cut me he said foolishly fishing for his handkerchief
now now said one of the officers
its only a scratch his senses became cleared now and he looked around
he was standing in a little store where they left him for the moment
outside he could see as he stood wiping his chin the car and the excited crowd
a patrol wagon was there and another
he walked over and looked out
it was an ambulance backing in
he saw some energetic charging by the police and arrests being made
come on now if you want to take your car said an officer opening the door and looking in
he walked out feeling rather uncertain of himself
he was very cold and frightened
wheres the conductor he asked
oh hes not here now said the policeman
hurstwood went toward the car and stepped nervously on
as he did so there was a pistol shot
something stung his shoulder
who fired that he heard an officer exclaim
by god
who did that both left him running toward a certain building
he paused a moment and then got down
george exclaimed hurstwood weakly this is too much for me he walked nervously to the corner and hurried down a side street
whew he said drawing in his breath
a half block away a small girl gazed at him
youd better sneak she called
he walked homeward in a blinding snowstorm reaching the ferry by dusk
the cabins were filled with comfortable souls who studied him curiously
his head was still in such a whirl that he felt confused
all the wonder of the twinkling lights of the river in a white storm passed for nothing
he trudged doggedly on until he reached the flat
there he entered and found the room warm
carrie was gone
a couple of evening papers were lying on the table where she left them
he lit the gas and sat down
then he got up and stripped to examine his shoulder
it was a mere scratch
he washed his hands and face still in a brown study apparently and combed his hair
then he looked for something to eat and finally his hunger gone sat down in his comfortable rockingchair
it was a wonderful relief
he put his hand to his chin forgetting for the moment the papers
well he said after a time his nature recovering itself thats a pretty tough game over there then he turned and saw the papers
with half a sigh he picked up the world strike spreading in brooklyn he read
rioting breaks out in all parts of the city he adjusted his paper very comfortably and continued
it was the one thing he read with absorbing interest
chapter xlii
a touch of spring the empty shell those who look upon hurstwoods brooklyn venture as an error of judgment will none the less realise the negative influence on him of the fact that he had tried and failed
carrie got a wrong idea of it
he said so little that she imagined he had encountered nothing worse than the ordinary roughnessquitting so soon in the face of this seemed trifling
he did not want to work
she was now one of a group of oriental beauties who in the second act of the comic opera were paraded by the vizier before the new potentate as the treasures of his harem
there was no word assigned to any of them but on the evening when hurstwood was housing himself in the loft of the streetcar barn the leading comedian and star feeling exceedingly facetious said in a profound voice which created a ripple of laughter well who are you it merely happened to be carrie who was courtesying before him
it might as well have been any of the others so far as he was concerned
he expected no answer and a dull one would have been reproved
but carrie whose experience and belief in herself gave her daring courtesied sweetly again and answered i am yours truly it was a trivial thing to say and yet something in the way she did it caught the audience which laughed heartily at the mockfierce potentate towering before the young woman
the comedian also liked it hearing the laughter
i thought your name was smith he returned endeavouring to get the last laugh
carrie almost trembled for her daring after she had said this
all members of the company had been warned that to interpolate lines or business meant a fine or worse
she did not know what to think
as she was standing in her proper position in the wings awaiting another entry the great comedian made his exit past her and paused in recognition
you can just leave that in hereafter he remarked seeing how intelligent she appeared
dont add any more though thank you said carrie humbly
when he went on she found herself trembling violently
well youre in luck remarked another member of the chorus
there isnt another one of us has got a line there was no gainsaying the value of this
everybody in the company realised that she had got a start
carrie hugged herself when next evening the lines got the same applause
she went home rejoicing knowing that soon something must come of it
it was hurstwood who by his presence caused her merry thoughts to flee and replaced them with sharp longings for an end of distress
the next day she asked him about his venture
theyre not trying to run any cars except with police
they dont want anybody just nownot before next week next week came but carrie saw no change
hurstwood seemed more apathetic than ever
he saw her off mornings to rehearsals and the like with the utmost calm
he read and read
several times he found himself staring at an item but thinking of something else
the first of these lapses that he sharply noticed concerned a hilarious party he had once attended at a driving club of which he had been a member
he sat gazing downward and gradually thought he heard the old voices and the clink of glasses
youre a dandy hurstwood his friend walker said
he was standing again well dressed smiling goodnatured the recipient of encores for a good story
all at once he looked up
the room was so still it seemed ghostlike
he heard the clock ticking audibly and half suspected that he had been dozing
the paper was so straight in his hands however and the items he had been reading so directly before him that he rid himself of the doze idea
still it seemed peculiar
when it occurred a second time however it did not seem quite so strange
butcher and grocery man baker and coal mannot the group with whom he was then dealing but those who had trusted him to the limitcalled
he met them all blandly becoming deft in excuse
at last he became bold pretended to be out or waved them off
they cant get blood out of a turnip he said if i had it id pay them carries little soldier friend miss osborne seeing her succeeding had become a sort of satellite
little osborne could never of herself amount to anything
she seemed to realise it in a sort of pussylike way and instinctively concluded to cling with her soft little claws to carrie
oh youll get up she kept telling carrie with admiration
youre so good timid as carrie was she was strong in capability
the reliance of others made her feel as if she must and when she must she dared
experience of the world and of necessity was in her favour
no longer the lightest word of a man made her head dizzy
she had learned that men could change and fail
flattery in its most palpable form had lost its force with her
it required superioritykindly superiorityto move herthe superiority of a genius like ames
i dont like the actors in our company she told lola one day
theyre all so struck on themselves dont you think mr barclays pretty nice inquired lola who had received a condescending smile or two from that quarter
oh hes nice enough answered carrie but he isnt sincere
he assumes such an air lola felt for her first hold upon carrie in the following manner are you paying roomrent where you are certainly answered carrie
why i know where i could get the loveliest room and bath cheap
its too big for me but it would be just right for two and the rent is only six dollars a week for both where said carrie
in seventeenth street well i dont know as id care to change said carrie who was already turning over the threedollar rate in her mind
she was thinking if she had only herself to support this would leave her seventeen for herself
nothing came of this until after the brooklyn adventure of hurstwoods and her success with the speaking part
then she began to feel as if she must be free
she thought of leaving hurstwood and thus making him act for himself but he had developed such peculiar traits she feared he might resist any effort to throw him off
he might hunt her out at the show and hound her in that way
she did not wholly believe that he would but he might
this she knew would be an embarrassing thing if he made himself conspicuous in any way
it troubled her greatly
things were precipitated by the offer of a better part
one of the actresses playing the part of a modest sweetheart gave notice of leaving and carrie was selected
how much are you going to get asked miss osborne on hearing the good news
i didnt ask him said carrie
well find out
goodness youll never get anything if you dont ask
tell them you must have forty dollars anyhow oh no said carrie
certainly exclaimed lola
ask em anyway carrie succumbed to this prompting waiting however until the manager gave her notice of what clothing she must have to fit the part
how much do i get she inquired
thirtyfive dollars he replied
carrie was too much astonished and delighted to think of mentioning forty
she was nearly beside herself and almost hugged lola who clung to her at the news
it isnt as much as you ought to get said the latter especially when youve got to buy clothes carrie remembered this with a start
where to get the money
she had none laid up for such an emergency
rent day was drawing near
ill not do it she said remembering her necessity
i dont use the flat
im not going to give up my money this time
ill move fitting into this came another appeal from miss osborne more urgent than ever
come live with me wont you she pleaded
we can have the loveliest room
it wont cost you hardly anything that way id like to said carrie frankly
oh do said lola
well have such a good time carrie thought a while
i believe i will she said and then added ill have to see first though with the idea thus grounded rent day approaching and clothes calling for instant purchase she soon found excuse in hurstwoods lassitude
he said less and drooped more than ever
as rent day approached an idea grew in him
it was fostered by the demands of creditors and the impossibility of holding up many more
twentyeight dollars was too much for rent
its hard on her he thought
we could get a cheaper place stirred with this idea he spoke at the breakfast table
dont you think we pay too much rent here he asked
indeed i do said carrie not catching his drift
i should think we could get a smaller place he suggested
we dont need four rooms her countenance had he been scrutinising her would have exhibited the disturbance she felt at this evidence of his determination to stay by her
he saw nothing remarkable in asking her to come down lower
oh i dont know she answered growing wary
there must be places around here where we could get a couple of rooms which would do just as well her heart revolted
never she thought
who would furnish the money to move
to think of being in two rooms with him
she resolved to spend her money for clothes quickly before something terrible happened
that very day she did it
having done so there was but one other thing to do
lola she said visiting her friend i think ill come oh jolly cried the latter
can we get it right away she asked meaning the room
certainly cried lola
they went to look at it
carrie had saved ten dollars from her expendituresenough for this and her board beside
her enlarged salary would not begin for ten days yetwould not reach her for seventeen
she paid half of the six dollars with her friend
now ive just enough to get on to the end of the week she confided
oh ive got some said lola
ive got twentyfive dollars if you need it no said carrie
i guess ill get along they decided to move friday which was two days away
now that the thing was settled carries heart misgave her
she felt very much like a criminal in the matter
each day looking at hurstwood she had realised that along with the disagreeableness of his attitude there was something pathetic
she looked at him the same evening she had made up her mind to go and now he seemed not so shiftless and worthless but run down and beaten upon by chance
his eyes were not keen his face marked his hands flabby
she thought his hair had a touch of grey
all unconscious of his doom he rocked and read his paper while she glanced at him
knowing that the end was so near she became rather solicitous
will you go over and get some canned peaches she asked hurstwood laying down a twodollar bill
certainly he said looking in wonder at the money
see if you can get some nice asparagus she added
ill cook it for dinner hurstwood rose and took the money slipping on his overcoat and getting his hat
carrie noticed that both of these articles of apparel were old and poor looking in appearance
it was plain enough before but now it came home with peculiar force
perhaps he couldnt help it after all
he had done well in chicago
she remembered his fine appearance the days he had met her in the park
then he was so sprightly so clean
had it been all his fault
he came back and laid the change down with the food
youd better keep it she observed
well need other things no he said with a sort of pride you keep it oh go on and keep it she replied rather unnerved
therell be other things he wondered at this not knowing the pathetic figure he had become in her eyes
she restrained herself with difficulty from showing a quaver in her voice
to say truly this would have been carries attitude in any case
she had looked back at times upon her parting from drouet and had regretted that she had served him so badly
she hoped she would never meet him again but she was ashamed of her conduct
not that she had any choice in the final separation
she had gone willingly to seek him with sympathy in her heart when hurstwood had reported him ill
there was something cruel somewhere and not being able to track it mentally to its logical lair she concluded with feeling that he would never understand what hurstwood had done and would see hardhearted decision in her deed hence her shame
not that she cared for him
she did not want to make any one who had been good to her feel badly
she did not realise what she was doing by allowing these feelings to possess her
hurstwood noticing the kindness conceived better of her
carries goodnatured anyhow he thought
going to miss osbornes that afternoon she found that little lady packing and singing
why dont you come over with me today she asked
oh i cant said carrie
ill be there friday
would you mind lending me the twentyfive dollars you spoke of why no said lola going for her purse
i want to get some other things said carrie
oh thats all right answered the little girl goodnaturedly glad to be of service
it had been days since hurstwood had done more than go to the grocery or to the newsstand
now the weariness of indoors was upon himhad been for two daysbut chill grey weather had held him back
friday broke fair and warm
it was one of those lovely harbingers of spring given as a sign in dreary winter that earth is not forsaken of warmth and beauty
the blue heaven holding its one golden orb poured down a crystal wash of warm light
it was plain from the voice of the sparrows that all was halcyon outside
carrie raised the front windows and felt the south wind blowing
its lovely out today she remarked
is it said hurstwood
after breakfast he immediately got his other clothes
will you be back for lunch asked carrie nervously
no he said
he went out into the streets and tramped north along seventh avenue idly fixing upon the harlem river as an objective point
he had seen some ships up there the time he had called upon the brewers
he wondered how the territory thereabouts was growing
passing fiftyninth street he took the west side of central park which he followed to seventyeighth street
then he remembered the neighbourhood and turned over to look at the mass of buildings erected
it was very much improved
the great open spaces were filling up
coming back he kept to the park until th street and then turned into seventh avenue again reaching the pretty river by one oclock
there it ran winding before his gaze shining brightly in the clear light between the undulating banks on the right and the tall treecovered heights on the left
the springlike atmosphere woke him to a sense of its loveliness and for a few moments he stood looking at it folding his hands behind his back
then he turned and followed it toward the east side idly seeking the ships he had seen
it was four oclock before the waning day with its suggestion of a cooler evening caused him to return
he was hungry and would enjoy eating in the warm room
when he reached the flat by halfpast five it was still dark
he knew that carrie was not there not only because there was no light showing through the transom but because the evening papers were stuck between the outside knob and the door
he opened with his key and went in
everything was still dark
lighting the gas he sat down preparing to wait a little while
even if carrie did come now dinner would be late
he read until six then got up to fix something for himself
as he did so he noticed that the room seemed a little queer
what was it
he looked around as if he missed something and then saw an envelope near where he had been sitting
it spoke for itself almost without further action on his part
reaching over he took it a sort of chill settling upon him even while he reached
the crackle of the envelope in his hands was loud
green paper money lay soft within the note
dear george he read crunching the money in one hand im going away
im not coming back any more
its no use trying to keep up the flat i cant do it
i wouldnt mind helping you if i could but i cant support us both and pay the rent
i need what little i make to pay for my clothes
im leaving twenty dollars
its all i have just now
you can do whatever you like with the furniture
i wont want itcarrie he dropped the note and looked quietly round
now he knew what he missed
it was the little ornamental clock which was hers
it had gone from the mantelpiece
he went into the front room his bedroom the parlour lighting the gas as he went
from the chiffonier had gone the knickknacks of silver and plate
from the tabletop the lace coverings
he opened the wardrobeno clothes of hers
he opened the drawersnothing of hers
her trunk was gone from its accustomed place
back in his own room hung his old clothes just as he had left them
nothing else was gone
he stepped into the parlour and stood for a few moments looking vacantly at the floor
the silence grew oppressive
the little flat seemed wonderfully deserted
he wholly forgot that he was hungry that it was only dinnertime
it seemed later in the night
suddenly he found that the money was still in his hands
there were twenty dollars in all as she had said
now he walked back leaving the lights ablaze and feeling as if the flat were empty
ill get out of this he said to himself
then the sheer loneliness of his situation rushed upon him in full
left me he muttered and repeated left me the place that had been so comfortable where he had spent so many days of warmth was now a memory
something colder and chillier confronted him
he sank down in his chair resting his chin in his handmere sensation without thought holding him
then something like a bereaved affection and selfpity swept over him
she neednt have gone away he said
id have got something he sat a long while without rocking and added quite clearly out loud i tried didnt i at midnight he was still rocking staring at the floor
chapter xliii
the world turns flatterer an eye in the dark installed in her comfortable room carrie wondered how hurstwood had taken her departure
she arranged a few things hastily and then left for the theatre half expecting to encounter him at the door
not finding him her dread lifted and she felt more kindly toward him
she quite forgot him until about to come out after the show when the chance of his being there frightened her
as day after day passed and she heard nothing at all the thought of being bothered by him passed
in a little while she was except for occasional thoughts wholly free of the gloom with which her life had been weighed in the flat
it is curious to note how quickly a profession absorbs one
carrie became wise in theatrical lore hearing the gossip of little lola
she learned what the theatrical papers were which ones published items about actresses and the like
she began to read the newspaper notices not only of the opera in which she had so small a part but of others
gradually the desire for notice took hold of her
she longed to be renowned like others and read with avidity all the complimentary or critical comments made concerning others high in her profession
the showy world in which her interest lay completely absorbed her
it was about this time that the newspapers and magazines were beginning to pay that illustrative attention to the beauties of the stage which has since become fervid
the newspapers and particularly the sunday newspapers indulged in large decorative theatrical pages in which the faces and forms of wellknown theatrical celebrities appeared enclosed with artistic scrolls
the magazines also or at least one or two of the newer onespublished occasional portraits of pretty stars and now and again photos of scenes from various plays
carrie watched these with growing interest
when would a scene from her opera appear
when would some paper think her photo worth while
the sunday before taking her new part she scanned the theatrical pages for some little notice
it would have accorded with her expectations if nothing had been said but there in the squibs tailing off several more substantial items was a wee notice
carrie read it with a tingling body the part of katisha the country maid in the wives of abdul at the broadway heretofore played by inez carew will be hereafter filled by carrie madenda one of the cleverest members of the chorus carrie hugged herself with delight
oh wasnt it just fine
at last
the first the longhoped for the delightful notice
and they called her clever
she could hardly restrain herself from laughing loudly
had lola seen it
theyve got a notice here of the part im going to play tomorrow night said carrie to her friend
oh jolly
have they cried lola running to her
thats all right she said looking
youll get more now if you do well
i had my picture in the world once did you asked carrie
did i
well i should say returned the little girl
they had a frame around it carrie laughed
theyve never published my picture but they will said lola
youll see
you do better than most that get theirs in now carrie felt deeply grateful for this
she almost loved lola for the sympathy and praise she extended
it was so helpful to herso almost necessary
fulfilling her part capably brought another notice in the papers that she was doing her work acceptably
this pleased her immensely
she began to think the world was taking note of her
the first week she got her thirtyfive dollars it seemed an enormous sum
paying only three dollars for room rent seemed ridiculous
after giving lola her twentyfive she still had seven dollars left
with four left over from previous earnings she had eleven
five of this went to pay the regular installment on the clothes she had to buy
the next week she was even in greater feather
now only three dollars need be paid for room rent and five on her clothes
the rest she had for food and her own whims
youd better save a little for summer cautioned lola
well probably close in may i intend to said carrie
the regular entrance of thirtyfive dollars a week to one who has endured scant allowances for several years is a demoralising thing
carrie found her purse bursting with good green bills of comfortable denominations
having no one dependent upon her she began to buy pretty clothes and pleasing trinkets to eat well and to ornament her room
friends were not long in gathering about
she met a few young men who belonged to lolas staff
the members of the opera company made her acquaintance without the formality of introduction
one of these discovered a fancy for her
on several occasions he strolled home with her
lets stop in and have a rarebit he suggested one midnight
very well said carrie
in the rosy restaurant filled with the merry lovers of late hours she found herself criticising this man
he was too stilted too selfopinionated
he did not talk of anything that lifted her above the common run of clothes and material success
when it was all over he smiled most graciously
got to go straight home have you he said
yes she answered with an air of quiet understanding
shes not so inexperienced as she looks he thought and thereafter his respect and ardour were increased
she could not help sharing in lolas love for a good time
there were days when they went carriage riding nights when after the show they dined afternoons when they strolled along broadway tastefully dressed
she was getting in the metropolitan whirl of pleasure
at last her picture appeared in one of the weeklies
she had not known of it and it took her breath
miss carrie madenda it was labelled
one of the favourites of the wives of abdul company at lolas advice she had had some pictures taken by sarony
they had got one there
she thought of going down and buying a few copies of the paper but remembered that there was no one she knew well enough to send them to
only lola apparently in all the world was interested
the metropolis is a cold place socially and carrie soon found that a little money brought her nothing
the world of wealth and distinction was quite as far away as ever
she could feel that there was no warm sympathetic friendship back of the easy merriment with which many approached her
all seemed to be seeking their own amusement regardless of the possible sad consequence to others
so much for the lessons of hurstwood and drouet
in april she learned that the opera would probably last until the middle or the end of may according to the size of the audiences
next season it would go on the road
she wondered if she would be with it
as usual miss osborne owing to her moderate salary was for securing a home engagement
theyre putting on a summer play at the casino she announced after figuratively putting her ear to the ground
lets try and get in that im willing said carrie
they tried in time and were apprised of the proper date to apply again
that was may th
meanwhile their own show closed may th
those that want to go with the show next season said the manager will have to sign this week dont you sign advised lola
i wouldnt go i know said carrie but maybe i cant get anything else well i wont said the little girl who had a resource in her admirers
i went once and i didnt have anything at the end of the season carrie thought this over
she had never been on the road
we can get along added lola
i always have carrie did not sign
the manager who was putting on the summer skit at the casino had never heard of carrie but the several notices she had received her published picture and the programme bearing her name had some little weight with him
he gave her a silent part at thirty dollars a week
didnt i tell you said lola
it doesnt do you any good to go away from new york
they forget all about you if you do now because carrie was pretty the gentlemen who made up the advance illustrations of shows about to appear for the sunday papers selected carries photo along with others to illustrate the announcement
because she was very pretty they gave it excellent space and drew scrolls about it
carrie was delighted
still the management did not seem to have seen anything of it
at least no more attention was paid to her than before
at the same time there seemed very little in her part
it consisted of standing around in all sorts of scenes a silent little quakeress
the author of the skit had fancied that a great deal could be made of such a part given to the right actress but now since it had been doled out to carrie he would as leave have had it cut out
dont kick old man remarked the manager
if it dont go the first week we will cut it out carrie had no warning of this halcyon intention
she practised her part ruefully feeling that she was effectually shelved
at the dress rehearsal she was disconsolate
that isnt so bad said the author the manager noting the curious effect which carries blues had upon the part
tell her to frown a little more when sparks dances carrie did not know it but there was the least show of wrinkles between her eyes and her mouth was puckered quaintly
frown a little more miss madenda said the stage manager
carrie instantly brightened up thinking he had meant it as a rebuke
no frown he said
frown as you did before carrie looked at him in astonishment
i mean it he said
frown hard when mr sparks dances
i want to see how it looks it was easy enough to do
carrie scowled
the effect was something so quaint and droll it caught even the manager
that is good he said
if shell do that all through i think it will take going over to carrie he said suppose you try frowning all through
do it hard
look mad
itll make the part really funny on the opening night it looked to carrie as if there were nothing to her part after all
the happy sweltering audience did not seem to see her in the first act
she frowned and frowned but to no effect
eyes were riveted upon the more elaborate efforts of the stars
in the second act the crowd wearied by a dull conversation roved with its eyes about the stage and sighted her
there she was greysuited sweetfaced demure but scowling
at first the general idea was that she was temporarily irritated that the look was genuine and not fun at all
as she went on frowning looking now at one principal and now at the other the audience began to smile
the portly gentlemen in the front rows began to feel that she was a delicious little morsel
it was the kind of frown they would have loved to force away with kisses
all the gentlemen yearned toward her
she was capital
at last the chief comedian singing in the centre of the stage noticed a giggle where it was not expected
then another and another
when the place came for loud applause it was only moderate
what could be the trouble
he realised that something was up
all at once after an exit he caught sight of carrie
she was frowning alone on the stage and the audience was giggling and laughing
by george i wont stand that thought the thespian
im not going to have my work cut up by some one else
either she quits that when i do my turn or i quit why thats all right said the manager when the kick came
thats what shes supposed to do
you neednt pay any attention to that but she ruins my work no she dont returned the former soothingly
its only a little fun on the side it is eh exclaimed the big comedian
she killed my hand all right
im not going to stand that well wait until after the show
wait until tomorrow
well see what we can do the next act however settled what was to be done
carrie was the chief feature of the play
the audience the more it studied her the more it indicated its delight
every other feature paled beside the quaint teasing delightful atmosphere which carrie contributed while on the stage
manager and company realised she had made a hit
the critics of the daily papers completed her triumph
there were long notices in praise of the quality of the burlesque touched with recurrent references to carrie
the contagious mirth of the thing was repeatedly emphasised
miss madenda presents one of the most delightful bits of character work ever seen on the casino stage observed the stage critic of the sun it is a bit of quiet unassuming drollery which warms like good wine
evidently the part was not intended to take precedence as miss madenda is not often on the stage but the audience with the characteristic perversity of such bodies selected for itself
the little quakeress was marked for a favourite the moment she appeared and thereafter easily held attention and applause
the vagaries of fortune are indeed curious the critic of the evening world seeking as usual to establish a catch phrase which should go with the town wound up by advising if you wish to be merry see carrie frown the result was miraculous so far as carries fortune was concerned
even during the morning she received a congratulatory message from the manager
you seem to have taken the town by storm he wrote
this is delightful
i am as glad for your sake as for my own the author also sent word
that evening when she entered the theatre the manager had a most pleasant greeting for her
mr
stevens he said referring to the author is preparing a little song which he would like you to sing next week oh i cant sing returned carrie
it isnt anything difficult
its something that is very simple he says and would suit you exactly of course i wouldnt mind trying said carrie archly
would you mind coming to the boxoffice a few moments before you dress observed the manager in addition
theres a little matter i want to speak to you about certainly replied carrie
in that latter place the manager produced a paper
now of course he said we want to be fair with you in the matter of salary
your contract here only calls for thirty dollars a week for the next three months
how would it do to make it say one hundred and fifty a week and extend it for twelve months oh very well said carrie scarcely believing her ears
supposing then you just sign this carrie looked and beheld a new contract made out like the other one with the exception of the new figures of salary and time
with a hand trembling from excitement she affixed her name
one hundred and fifty a week she murmured when she was again alone
she found after allas what millionaire has notthat there was no realising in consciousness the meaning of large sums
it was only a shimmering glittering phrase in which lay a world of possibilities
down in a thirdrate bleecker street hotel the brooding hurstwood read the dramatic item covering carries success without at first realising who was meant
then suddenly it came to him and he read the whole thing over again
thats her all right i guess he said
then he looked about upon a dingy motheaten hotel lobby
i guess shes struck it he thought a picture of the old shiny plushcovered world coming back with its lights its ornaments its carriages and flowers
ah she was in the walled city now
its splendid gates had opened admitting her from a cold dreary outside
she seemed a creature afar offlike every other celebrity he had known
well let her have it he said
i wont bother her it was the grim resolution of a bent bedraggled but unbroken pride
chapter xliv
and this is not elf land what gold will not buy when carrie got back on the stage she found that over night her dressingroom had been changed
you are to use this room miss madenda said one of the stage lackeys
no longer any need of climbing several flights of steps to a small coop shared with another
instead a comparatively large and commodious chamber with conveniences not enjoyed by the small fry overhead
she breathed deeply and with delight
her sensations were more physical than mental
in fact she was scarcely thinking at all
heart and body were having their say
gradually the deference and congratulation gave her a mental appreciation of her state
she was no longer ordered but requested and that politely
the other members of the cast looked at her enviously as she came out arrayed in her simple habit which she wore all through the play
all those who had supposedly been her equals and superiors now smiled the smile of sociability as much as to say how friendly we have always been only the star comedian whose part had been so deeply injured stalked by himself
figuratively he could not kiss the hand that smote him
doing her simple part carrie gradually realised the meaning of the applause which was for her and it was sweet
she felt mildly guilty of somethingperhaps unworthiness
when her associates addressed her in the wings she only smiled weakly
the pride and daring of place were not for her
it never once crossed her mind to be reserved or haughtyto be other than she had been
after the performances she rode to her room with lola in a carriage provided
then came a week in which the first fruits of success were offered to her lipsbowl after bowl
it did not matter that her splendid salary had not begun
the world seemed satisfied with the promise
she began to get letters and cards
a mr witherswhom she did not know from adamhaving learned by some hook or crook where she resided bowed himself politely in
you will excuse me for intruding he said but have you been thinking of changing your apartments i hadnt thought of it returned carrie
well i am connected with the wellingtonthe new hotel on broadway
you have probably seen notices of it in the papers carrie recognised the name as standing for one of the newest and most imposing hostelries
she had heard it spoken of as having a splendid restaurant
just so went on mr withers accepting her acknowledgment of familiarity
we have some very elegant rooms at present which we would like to have you look at if you have not made up your mind where you intend to reside for the summer
our apartments are perfect in every detailhot and cold water private baths special hall service for every floor elevators and all that
you know what our restaurant is carrie looked at him quietly
she was wondering whether he took her to be a millionaire
what are your rates she inquired
well now that is what i came to talk with you privately about
our regular rates are anywhere from three to fifty dollars a day mercy interrupted carrie
i couldnt pay any such rate as that i know how you feel about it exclaimed mr withers halting
but just let me explain
i said those are our regular rates
like every other hotel we make special ones however
possibly you have not thought about it but your name is worth something to us oh ejaculated carrie seeing at a glance
of course
every hotel depends upon the repute of its patrons
a wellknown actress like yourself and he bowed politely while carrie flushed draws attention to the hotel andalthough you may not believe itpatrons oh yes returned carrie vacantly trying to arrange this curious proposition in her mind
now continued mr withers swaying his derby hat softly and beating one of his polished shoes upon the floor i want to arrange if possible to have you come and stop at the wellington
you need not trouble about terms
in fact we need hardly discuss them
anything will do for the summera mere figureanything that you think you could afford to pay carrie was about to interrupt but he gave her no chance
you can come today or tomorrowthe earlier the betterand we will give you your choice of nice light outside roomsthe very best we have youre very kind said carrie touched by the agents extreme affability
i should like to come very much
i would want to pay what is right however
i shouldnt want to you need not trouble about that at all interrupted mr withers
we can arrange that to your entire satisfaction at any time
if three dollars a day is satisfactory to you it will be so to us
all you have to do is to pay that sum to the clerk at the end of the week or month just as you wish and he will give you a receipt for what the rooms would cost if charged for at our regular rates the speaker paused
suppose you come and look at the rooms he added
id be glad to said carrie but i have a rehearsal this morning i did not mean at once he returned
any time will do
would this afternoon be inconvenient not at all said carrie
suddenly she remembered lola who was out at the time
i have a roommate she added who will have to go wherever i do
i forgot about that oh very well said mr withers blandly
it is for you to say whom you want with you
as i say all that can be arranged to suit yourself he bowed and backed toward the door
at four then we may expect you yes said carrie
i will be there to show you and so mr withers withdrew
after rehearsal carrie informed lola
did they really exclaimed the latter thinking of the wellington as a group of managers
isnt that fine
oh jolly
its so swell
thats where we dined that night we went with those two cushing boys
dont you know i remember said carrie
oh its as fine as it can be wed better be going up there observed carrie later in the afternoon
the rooms which mr withers displayed to carrie and lola were three and batha suite on the parlour floor
they were done in chocolate and dark red with rugs and hangings to match
three windows looked down into busy broadway on the east three into a side street which crossed there
there were two lovely bedrooms set with brass and white enamel beds white ribbontrimmed chairs and chiffoniers to match
in the third room or parlour was a piano a heavy piano lamp with a shade of gorgeous pattern a library table several huge easy rockers some dado book shelves and a gilt curio case filled with oddities
pictures were upon the walls soft turkish pillows upon the divan footstools of brown plush upon the floor
such accommodations would ordinarily cost a hundred dollars a week
oh lovely exclaimed lola walking about
it is comfortable said carrie who was lifting a lace curtain and looking down into crowded broadway
the bath was a handsome affair done in white enamel with a large bluebordered stone tub and nickel trimmings
it was bright and commodious with a bevelled mirror set in the wall at one end and incandescent lights arranged in three places
do you find these satisfactory observed mr withers
oh very answered carrie
well then any time you find it convenient to move in they are ready
the boy will bring you the keys at the door carrie noted the elegantly carpeted and decorated hall the marbled lobby and showy waitingroom
it was such a place as she had often dreamed of occupying
i guess wed better move right away dont you think so she observed to lola thinking of the commonplace chamber in seventeenth street
oh by all means said the latter
the next day her trunks left for the new abode
dressing after the matine on wednesday a knock came at her dressingroom door
carrie looked at the card handed by the boy and suffered a shock of surprise
tell her ill be right out she said softly
then looking at the card added mrs
vance why you little sinner the latter exclaimed as she saw carrie coming toward her across the now vacant stage
how in the world did this happen carrie laughed merrily
there was no trace of embarrassment in her friends manner
you would have thought that the long separation had come about accidentally
i dont know returned carrie warming in spite of her first troubled feelings toward this handsome goodnatured young matron
well you know i saw your picture in the sunday paper but your name threw me off
i thought it must be you or somebody that looked just like you and i said well now i will go right down there and see i was never more surprised in my life
how are you anyway oh very well returned carrie
how have you been fine
but arent you a success
dear oh
all the papers talking about you
i should think you would be just too proud to breathe
i was almost afraid to come back here this afternoon oh nonsense said carrie blushing
you know id be glad to see you well anyhow here you are
cant you come up and take dinner with me now
where are you stopping at the wellington said carrie who permitted herself a touch of pride in the acknowledgment
oh are you exclaimed the other upon whom the name was not without its proper effect
tactfully mrs vance avoided the subject of hurstwood of whom she could not help thinking
no doubt carrie had left him
that much she surmised
oh i dont think i can said carrie tonight
i have so little time
i must be back here by
wont you come and dine with me id be delighted but i cant tonight said mrs vance studying carries fine appearance
the latters good fortune made her seem more than ever worthy and delightful in the others eyes
i promised faithfully to be home at six glancing at the small gold watch pinned to her bosom she added i must be going too
tell me when youre coming up if at all why any time you like said carrie
well tomorrow then
im living at the chelsea now moved again exclaimed carrie laughing
yes
you know i cant stay six months in one place
i just have to move
remember nowhalfpast five i wont forget said carrie casting a glance at her as she went away
then it came to her that she was as good as this woman nowperhaps better
something in the others solicitude and interest made her feel as if she were the one to condescend
now as on each preceding day letters were handed her by the doorman at the casino
this was a feature which had rapidly developed since monday
what they contained she well knew
mash notes were old affairs in their mildest form
she remembered having received her first one far back in columbia city
since then as a chorus girl she had received othersgentlemen who prayed for an engagement
they were common sport between her and lola who received some also
they both frequently made light of them
now however they came thick and fast
gentlemen with fortunes did not hesitate to note as an addition to their own amiable collection of virtues that they had their horses and carriages
thus one i have a million in my own right
i could give you every luxury
there isnt anything you could ask for that you couldnt have
i say this not because i want to speak of my money but because i love you and wish to gratify your every desire
it is love that prompts me to write
will you not give me one halfhour in which to plead my cause such of these letters as came while carrie was still in the seventeenth street place were read with more interestthough never delightthan those which arrived after she was installed in her luxurious quarters at the wellington
even there her vanityor that selfappreciation which in its more rabid form is called vanitywas not sufficiently cloyed to make these things wearisome
adulation being new in any form pleased her
only she was sufficiently wise to distinguish between her old condition and her new one
she had not had fame or money before
now they had come
she had not had adulation and affectionate propositions before
now they had come
wherefore
she smiled to think that men should suddenly find her so much more attractive
in the least way it incited her to coolness and indifference
do look here she remarked to lola
see what this man says if you will only deign to grant me one halfhour she repeated with an imitation of languor
the idea
arent men silly he must have lots of money the way he talks observed lola
thats what they all say said carrie innocently
why dont you see him suggested lola and hear what he has to say indeed i wont said carrie
i know what hed say
i dont want to meet anybody that way lola looked at her with big merry eyes
he couldnt hurt you she returned
you might have some fun with him carrie shook her head
youre awfully queer returned the little blueeyed soldier
thus crowded fortune
for this whole week though her large salary had not yet arrived it was as if the world understood and trusted her
without moneyor the requisite sum at leastshe enjoyed the luxuries which money could buy
for her the doors of fine places seemed to open quite without the asking
these palatial chambers how marvellously they came to her
the elegant apartments of mrs vance in the chelseathese were hers
men sent flowers love notes offers of fortune
and still her dreams ran riot
the one hundred and fifty
the one hundred and fifty
what a door to an aladdins cave it seemed to be
each day her head almost turned by developments her fancies of what her fortune must be with ample money grew and multiplied
she conceived of delights which were notsaw lights of joy that never were on land or sea
then at last after a world of anticipation came her first installment of one hundred and fifty dollars
it was paid to her in greenbacksthree twenties six tens and six fives
thus collected it made a very convenient roll
it was accompanied by a smile and a salutation from the cashier who paid it
ah yes said the latter when she applied miss madendaone hundred and fifty dollars
quite a success the show seems to have made yes indeed returned carrie
right after came one of the insignificant members of the company and she heard the changed tone of address
how much said the same cashier sharply
one such as she had only recently been was waiting for her modest salary
it took her back to the few weeks in which she had collectedor rather had receivedalmost with the air of a domestic fourfifty per week from a lordly foreman in a shoe factorya man who in distributing the envelopes had the manner of a prince doling out favours to a servile group of petitioners
she knew that out in chicago this very day the same factory chamber was full of poor homelyclad girls working in long lines at clattering machines that at noon they would eat a miserable lunch in a halfhour that saturday they would gather as they had when she was one of them and accept the small pay for work a hundred times harder than she was now doing
oh it was so easy now
the world was so rosy and bright
she felt so thrilled that she must needs walk back to the hotel to think wondering what she should do
it does not take money long to make plain its impotence providing the desires are in the realm of affection
with her one hundred and fifty in hand carrie could think of nothing particularly to do
in itself as a tangible apparent thing which she could touch and look upon it was a diverting thing for a few days but this soon passed
her hotel bill did not require its use
her clothes had for some time been wholly satisfactory
another day or two and she would receive another hundred and fifty
it began to appear as if this were not so startlingly necessary to maintain her present state
if she wanted to do anything better or move higher she must have morea great deal more
now a critic called to get up one of those tinsel interviews which shine with clever observations show up the wit of critics display the folly of celebrities and divert the public
he liked carrie and said so publiclyadding however that she was merely pretty goodnatured and lucky
this cut like a knife
the herald getting up an entertainment for the benefit of its free ice fund did her the honour to beg her to appear along with celebrities for nothing
she was visited by a young author who had a play which he thought she could produce
alas she could not judge
it hurt her to think it
then she found she must put her money in the bank for safety and so moving finally reached the place where it struck her that the door to lifes perfect enjoyment was not open
gradually she began to think it was because it was summer
nothing was going on much save such entertainments as the one in which she was the star
fifth avenue was boarded up where the rich had deserted their mansions
madison avenue was little better
broadway was full of loafing thespians in search of next seasons engagements
the whole city was quiet and her nights were taken up with her work
hence the feeling that there was little to do
i dont know she said to lola one day sitting at one of the windows which looked down into broadway i get lonely dont you no said lola not very often
you wont go anywhere
thats whats the matter with you where can i go why therere lots of places returned lola who was thinking of her own lightsome tourneys with the gay youths
you wont go with anybody i dont want to go with these people who write to me
i know what kind they are you oughtnt to be lonely said lola thinking of carries success
therere lots would give their ears to be in your shoes carrie looked out again at the passing crowd
i dont know she said
unconsciously her idle hands were beginning to weary
chapter xlv
curious shifts of the poor the gloomy hurstwood sitting in his cheap hotel where he had taken refuge with seventy dollarsthe price of his furniturebetween him and nothing saw a hot summer out and a cool fall in reading
he was not wholly indifferent to the fact that his money was slipping away
as fifty cents after fifty cents were paid out for a days lodging he became uneasy and finally took a cheaper roomthirtyfive cents a dayto make his money last longer
frequently he saw notices of carrie
her picture was in the world once or twice and an old herald he found in a chair informed him that she had recently appeared with some others at a benefit for something or other
he read these things with mingled feelings
each one seemed to put her farther and farther away into a realm which became more imposing as it receded from him
on the billboards too he saw a pretty poster showing her as the quaker maid demure and dainty
more than once he stopped and looked at these gazing at the pretty face in a sullen sort of way
his clothes were shabby and he presented a marked contrast to all that she now seemed to be
somehow so long as he knew she was at the casino though he had never any intention of going near her there was a subconscious comfort for himhe was not quite alone
the show seemed such a fixture that after a month or two he began to take it for granted that it was still running
in september it went on the road and he did not notice it
when all but twenty dollars of his money was gone he moved to a fifteencent lodginghouse in the bowery where there was a bare loungingroom filled with tables and benches as well as some chairs
here his preference was to close his eyes and dream of other days a habit which grew upon him
it was not sleep at first but a mental hearkening back to scenes and incidents in his chicago life
as the present became darker the past grew brighter and all that concerned it stood in relief
he was unconscious of just how much this habit had hold of him until one day he found his lips repeating an old answer he had made to one of his friends
they were in fitzgerald and moys
it was as if he stood in the door of his elegant little office comfortably dressed talking to sagar morrison about the value of south chicago real estate in which the latter was about to invest
how would you like to come in on that with me he heard morrison say
not me he answered just as he had years before
i have my hands full now the movement of his lips aroused him
he wondered whether he had really spoken
the next time he noticed anything of the sort he really did talk
why dont you jump you bloody fool he was saying
jump it was a funny english story he was telling to a company of actors
even as his voice recalled him he was smiling
a crusty old codger sitting near by seemed disturbed at least he stared in a most pointed way
hurstwood straightened up
the humour of the memory fled in an instant and he felt ashamed
for relief he left his chair and strolled out into the streets
one day looking down the ad
columns of the evening world he saw where a new play was at the casino
instantly he came to a mental halt
carrie had gone
he remembered seeing a poster of her only yesterday but no doubt it was one left uncovered by the new signs
curiously this fact shook him up
he had almost to admit that somehow he was depending upon her being in the city
now she was gone
he wondered how this important fact had skipped him
goodness knows when she would be back now
impelled by a nervous fear he rose and went into the dingy hall where he counted his remaining money unseen
there were but ten dollars in all
he wondered how all these other lodginghouse people around him got along
they didnt seem to do anything
perhaps they beggedunquestionably they did
many was the dime he had given to such as they in his day
he had seen other men asking for money on the streets
maybe he could get some that way
there was horror in this thought
sitting in the lodginghouse room he came to his last fifty cents
he had saved and counted until his health was affected
his stoutness had gone
with it even the semblance of a fit in his clothes
now he decided he must do something and walking about saw another day go by bringing him down to his last twenty centsnot enough to eat for the morrow
summoning all his courage he crossed to broadway and up to the broadway central hotel
within a block he halted undecided
a big heavyfaced porter was standing at one of the side entrances looking out
hurstwood purposed to appeal to him
walking straight up he was upon him before he could turn away
my friend he said recognising even in his plight the mans inferiority is there anything about this hotel that i could get to do the porter stared at him the while he continued to talk
im out of work and out of money and ive got to get somethingit doesnt matter what
i dont care to talk about what ive been but if youd tell me how to get something to do id be much obliged to you
it wouldnt matter if it only lasted a few days just now
ive got to have something the porter still gazed trying to look indifferent
then seeing that hurstwood was about to go on he said ive nothing to do with it
youll have to ask inside curiously this stirred hurstwood to further effort
i thought you might tell me the fellow shook his head irritably
inside went the exmanager and straight to an office off the clerks desk
one of the managers of the hotel happened to be there
hurstwood looked him straight in the eye
could you give me something to do for a few days he said
im in a position where i have to get something at once the comfortable manager looked at him as much as to say well i should judge so i came here explained hurstwood nervously because ive been a manager myself in my day
ive had bad luck in a way but im not here to tell you that
i want something to do if only for a week the man imagined he saw a feverish gleam in the applicants eye
what hotel did you manage he inquired
it wasnt a hotel said hurstwood
i was manager of fitzgerald and moys place in chicago for fifteen years is that so said the hotel man
how did you come to get out of that the figure of hurstwood was rather surprising in contrast to the fact
well by foolishness of my own
it isnt anything to talk about now
you could find out if you wanted to
im broke now and if you will believe me i havent eaten anything today the hotel man was slightly interested in this story
he could hardly tell what to do with such a figure and yet hurstwoods earnestness made him wish to do something
call olsen he said turning to the clerk
in reply to a bell and a disappearing hallboy olsen the head porter appeared
olsen said the manager is there anything downstairs you could find for this man to do
id like to give him something i dont know sir said olsen
we have about all the help we need
i think i could find something sir though if you like do
take him to the kitchen and tell wilson to give him something to eat all right sir said olsen
hurstwood followed
out of the managers sight the head porters manner changed
i dont know what the devil there is to do he observed
hurstwood said nothing
to him the big trunk hustler was a subject for private contempt
youre to give this man something to eat he observed to the cook
the latter looked hurstwood over and seeing something keen and intellectual in his eyes said well sit down over there thus was hurstwood installed in the broadway central but not for long
he was in no shape or mood to do the scrub work that exists about the foundation of every hotel
nothing better offering he was set to aid the fireman to work about the basement to do anything and everything that might offer
porters cooks firemen clerksall were over him
moreover his appearance did not please these individualshis temper was too lonelyand they made it disagreeable for him
with the stolidity and indifference of despair however he endured it all sleeping in an attic at the roof of the house eating what the cook gave him accepting a few dollars a week which he tried to save
his constitution was in no shape to endure
one day the following february he was sent on an errand to a large coal companys office
it had been snowing and thawing and the streets were sloppy
he soaked his shoes in his progress and came back feeling dull and weary
all the next day he felt unusually depressed and sat about as much as possible to the irritation of those who admired energy in others
in the afternoon some boxes were to be moved to make room for new culinary supplies
he was ordered to handle a truck
encountering a big box he could not lift it
whats the matter there said the head porter
cant you handle it he was straining to lift it but now he quit
no he said weakly
the man looked at him and saw that he was deathly pale
not sick are you he asked
i think i am returned hurstwood
well youd better go sit down then this he did but soon grew rapidly worse
it seemed all he could do to crawl to his room where he remained for a day
that man wheelers sick reported one of the lackeys to the night clerk
whats the matter with him i dont know
hes got a high fever the hotel physician looked at him
better send him to bellevue he recommended
hes got pneumonia accordingly he was carted away
in three weeks the worst was over but it was nearly the first of may before his strength permitted him to be turned out
then he was discharged
no more weakly looking object ever strolled out into the spring sunshine than the once hale lusty manager
all his corpulency had fled
his face was thin and pale his hands white his body flabby
clothes and all he weighed but one hundred and thirtyfive pounds
some old garments had been given hima cheap brown coat and misfit pair of trousers
also some change and advice
he was told to apply to the charities
again he resorted to the bowery lodginghouse brooding over where to look
from this it was but a step to beggary
what can a man do he said
i cant starve his first application was in sunny second avenue
a welldressed man came leisurely strolling toward him out of stuyvesant park
hurstwood nerved himself and sidled near
would you mind giving me ten cents he said directly
im in a position where i must ask some one the man scarcely looked at him fished in his vest pocket and took out a dime
there you are he said
much obliged said hurstwood softly but the other paid no more attention to him
satisfied with his success and yet ashamed of his situation he decided that he would only ask for twentyfive cents more since that would be sufficient
he strolled about sizing up people but it was long before just the right face and situation arrived
when he asked he was refused
shocked by this result he took an hour to recover and then asked again
this time a nickel was given him
by the most watchful effort he did get twenty cents more but it was painful
the next day he resorted to the same effort experiencing a variety of rebuffs and one or two generous receptions
at last it crossed his mind that there was a science of faces and that a man could pick the liberal countenance if he tried
it was no pleasure to him however this stopping of passersby
he saw one man taken up for it and now troubled lest he should be arrested
nevertheless he went on vaguely anticipating that indefinite something which is always better
it was with a sense of satisfaction then that he saw announced one morning the return of the casino company with miss carrie madenda he had thought of her often enough in days past
how successful she washow much money she must have
even now however it took a severe run of ill luck to decide him to appeal to her
he was truly hungry before he said ill ask her
she wont refuse me a few dollars accordingly he headed for the casino one afternoon passing it several times in an effort to locate the stage entrance
then he sat in bryant park a block away waiting
she cant refuse to help me a little he kept saying to himself
beginning with halfpast six he hovered like a shadow about the thirtyninth street entrance pretending always to be a hurrying pedestrian and yet fearful lest he should miss his object
he was slightly nervous too now that the eventful hour had arrived but being weak and hungry his ability to suffer was modified
at last he saw that the actors were beginning to arrive and his nervous tension increased until it seemed as if he could not stand much more
once he thought he saw carrie coming and moved forward only to see that he was mistaken
she cant be long now he said to himself half fearing to encounter her and equally depressed at the thought that she might have gone in by another way
his stomach was so empty that it ached
individual after individual passed him nearly all well dressed almost all indifferent
he saw coaches rolling by gentlemen passing with ladiesthe evenings merriment was beginning in this region of theatres and hotels
suddenly a coach rolled up and the driver jumped down to open the door
before hurstwood could act two ladies flounced across the broad walk and disappeared in the stage door
he thought he saw carrie but it was so unexpected so elegant and far away he could hardly tell
he waited a while longer growing feverish with want and then seeing that the stage door no longer opened and that a merry audience was arriving he concluded it must have been carrie and turned away
lord he said hastening out of the street into which the more fortunate were pouring ive got to get something at that hour when broadway is wont to assume its most interesting aspect a peculiar individual invariably took his stand at the corner of twentysixth street and broadwaya spot which is also intersected by fifth avenue
this was the hour when the theatres were just beginning to receive their patrons
fire signs announcing the nights amusements blazed on every hand
cabs and carriages their lamps gleaming like yellow eyes pattered by
couples and parties of three and four freely mingled in the common crowd which poured by in a thick stream laughing and jesting
on fifth avenue were loungersa few wealthy strollers a gentleman in evening dress with his lady on his arm some clubmen passing from one smokingroom to another
across the way the great hotels showed a hundred gleaming windows their cafs and billiardrooms filled with a comfortable welldressed and pleasureloving throng
all about was the night pulsating with the thoughts of pleasure and exhilarationthe curious enthusiasm of a great city bent upon finding joy in a thousand different ways
this unique individual was no less than an exsoldier turned religionist who having suffered the whips and privations of our peculiar social system had concluded that his duty to the god which he conceived lay in aiding his fellowman
the form of aid which he chose to administer was entirely original with himself
it consisted of securing a bed for all such homeless wayfarers as should apply to him at this particular spot though he had scarcely the wherewithal to provide a comfortable habitation for himself
taking his place amid this lightsome atmosphere he would stand his stocky figure cloaked in a great cape overcoat his head protected by a broad slouch hat awaiting the applicants who had in various ways learned the nature of his charity
for a while he would stand alone gazing like any idler upon an everfascinating scene
on the evening in question a policeman passing saluted him as captain in a friendly way
an urchin who had frequently seen him before stopped to gaze
all others took him for nothing out of the ordinary save in the matter of dress and conceived of him as a stranger whistling and idling for his own amusement
as the first halfhour waned certain characters appeared
here and there in the passing crowds one might see now and then a loiterer edging interestedly near
a slouchy figure crossed the opposite corner and glanced furtively in his direction
another came down fifth avenue to the corner of twentysixth street took a general survey and hobbled off again
two or three noticeable bowery types edged along the fifth avenue side of madison square but did not venture over
the soldier in his cape overcoat walked a short line of ten feet at his corner to and fro indifferently whistling
as nine oclock approached some of the hubbub of the earlier hour passed
the atmosphere of the hotels was not so youthful
the air too was colder
on every hand curious figures were movingwatchers and peepers without an imaginary circle which they seemed afraid to entera dozen in all
presently with the arrival of a keener sense of cold one figure came forward
it crossed broadway from out the shadow of twentysixth street and in a halting circuitous way arrived close to the waiting figure
there was something shamefaced or diffident about the movement as if the intention were to conceal any idea of stopping until the very last moment
then suddenly close to the soldier came the halt
the captain looked in recognition but there was no especial greeting
the newcomer nodded slightly and murmured something like one who waits for gifts
the other simply motioned toward the edge of the walk
stand over there he said
by this the spell was broken
even while the soldier resumed his short solemn walk other figures shuffled forward
they did not so much as greet the leader but joined the one sniffling and hitching and scraping their feet
cold aint it im glad winters over looks as though it might rain the motley company had increased to ten
one or two knew each other and conversed
others stood off a few feet not wishing to be in the crowd and yet not counted out
they were peevish crusty silent eying nothing in particular and moving their feet
there would have been talking soon but the soldier gave them no chance
counting sufficient to begin he came forward
beds eh all of you there was a general shuffle and murmur of approval
well line up here
ill see what i can do
i havent a cent myself they fell into a sort of broken ragged line
one might see now some of the chief characteristics by contrast
there was a wooden leg in the line
hats were all drooping a group that would ill become a secondhand hester street basement collection
trousers were all warped and frayed at the bottom and coats worn and faded
in the glare of the store lights some of the faces looked dry and chalky others were red with blotches and puffed in the cheeks and under the eyes one or two were rawboned and reminded one of railroad hands
a few spectators came near drawn by the seemingly conferring group then more and more and quickly there was a pushing gaping crowd
some one in the line began to talk
silence exclaimed the captain
now then gentlemen these men are without beds
they have to have some place to sleep tonight
they cant lie out in the streets
i need twelve cents to put one of them to bed
who will give it to me no reply
well well have to wait here boys until some one does
twelve cents isnt so very much for one man heres fifteen exclaimed a young man peering forward with strained eyes
its all i can afford all right
now i have fifteen
step out of the line and seizing one by the shoulder the captain marched him off a little way and stood him up alone
coming back he resumed his place and began again
i have three cents left
these men must be put to bed somehow
there arecountingone two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve men
nine cents more will put the next man to bed give him a good comfortable bed for the night
i go right along and look after that myself
who will give me nine cents one of the watchers this time a middleaged man handed him a fivecent piece
now i have eight cents
four more will give this man a bed
come gentlemen
we are going very slow this evening
you all have good beds
how about these here you are remarked a bystander putting a coin into his hand
that said the captain looking at the coin pays for two beds for two men and gives me five on the next one
who will give me seven cents more i will said a voice
coming down sixth avenue this evening hurstwood chanced to cross east through twentysixth street toward third avenue
he was wholly disconsolate in spirit hungry to what he deemed an almost mortal extent weary and defeated
how should he get at carrie now
it would be eleven before the show was over
if she came in a coach she would go away in one
he would need to interrupt under most trying circumstances
worst of all he was hungry and weary and at best a whole day must intervene for he had not heart to try again tonight
he had no food and no bed
when he neared broadway he noticed the captains gathering of wanderers but thinking it to be the result of a street preacher or some patent medicine fakir was about to pass on
however in crossing the street toward madison square park he noticed the line of men whose beds were already secured stretching out from the main body of the crowd
in the glare of the neighbouring electric light he recognised a type of his own kindthe figures whom he saw about the streets and in the lodginghouses drifting in mind and body like himself
he wondered what it could be and turned back
there was the captain curtly pleading as before
he heard with astonishment and a sense of relief the oftrepeated words these men must have a bed before him was the line of unfortunates whose beds were yet to be had and seeing a newcomer quietly edge up and take a position at the end of the line he decided to do likewise
what use to contend
he was weary tonight
it was a simple way out of one difficulty at least
tomorrow maybe he would do better
back of him where some of those were whose beds were safe a relaxed air was apparent
the strain of uncertainty being removed he heard them talking with moderate freedom and some leaning toward sociability
politics religion the state of the government some newspaper sensations and the more notorious facts the world over found mouthpieces and auditors there
cracked and husky voices pronounced forcibly upon odd matters
vague and rambling observations were made in reply
there were squints and leers and some dull oxlike stares from those who were too dull or too weary to converse
standing tells
hurstwood became more weary waiting
he thought he should drop soon and shifted restlessly from one foot to the other
at last his turn came
the man ahead had been paid for and gone to the blessed line of success
he was now first and already the captain was talking for him
twelve cents gentlementwelve cents puts this man to bed
he wouldnt stand here in the cold if he had any place to go hurstwood swallowed something that rose to his throat
hunger and weakness had made a coward of him
here you are said a stranger handing money to the captain
now the latter put a kindly hand on the exmanagers shoulder
line up over there he said
once there hurstwood breathed easier
he felt as if the world were not quite so bad with such a good man in it
others seemed to feel like himself about this
captains a great feller aint he said the man aheada little woebegone helplesslooking sort of individual who looked as though he had ever been the sport and care of fortune
yes said hurstwood indifferently
huh
theres a lot back there yet said a man farther up leaning out and looking back at the applicants for whom the captain was pleading
yes
must be over a hundred tonight said another
look at the guy in the cab observed a third
a cab had stopped
some gentleman in evening dress reached out a bill to the captain who took it with simple thanks and turned away to his line
there was a general craning of necks as the jewel in the white shirt front sparkled and the cab moved off
even the crowd gaped in awe
that fixes up nine men for the night said the captain counting out as many of the line near him
line up over there
now then there are only seven
i need twelve cents money came slowly
in the course of time the crowd thinned out to a meagre handful
fifth avenue save for an occasional cab or foot passenger was bare
broadway was thinly peopled with pedestrians
only now and then a stranger passing noticed the small group handed out a coin and went away unheeding
the captain remained stolid and determined
he talked on very slowly uttering the fewest words and with a certain assurance as though he could not fail
come i cant stay out here all night
these men are getting tired and cold
some one give me four cents there came a time when he said nothing at all
money was handed him and for each twelve cents he singled out a man and put him in the other line
then he walked up and down as before looking at the ground
the theatres let out
fire signs disappeared
a clock struck eleven
another halfhour and he was down to the last two men
come now he exclaimed to several curious observers eighteen cents will fix us all up for the night
eighteen cents
i have six
somebody give me the money
remember i have to go over to brooklyn yet tonight
before that i have to take these men down and put them to bed
eighteen cents no one responded
he walked to and fro looking down for several minutes occasionally saying softly eighteen cents it seemed as if this paltry sum would delay the desired culmination longer than all the rest had
hurstwood buoyed up slightly by the long line of which he was a part refrained with an effort from groaning he was so weak
at last a lady in opera cape and rustling skirts came down fifth avenue accompanied by her escort
hurstwood gazed wearily reminded by her both of carrie in her new world and of the time when he had escorted his own wife in like manner
while he was gazing she turned and looking at the remarkable company sent her escort over
he came holding a bill in his fingers all elegant and graceful
here you are he said
thanks said the captain turning to the two remaining applicants
now we have some for tomorrow night he added
therewith he lined up the last two and proceeded to the head counting as he went
one hundred and thirtyseven he announced
now boys line up
right dress there
we wont be much longer about this
steady now he placed himself at the head and called out forward hurstwood moved with the line
across fifth avenue through madison square by the winding paths east on twentythird street and down third avenue wound the long serpentine company
midnight pedestrians and loiterers stopped and stared as the company passed
chatting policemen at various corners stared indifferently or nodded to the leader whom they had seen before
on third avenue they marched a seemingly weary way to eighth street where there was a lodginghouse closed apparently for the night
they were expected however
outside in the gloom they stood while the leader parleyed within
then doors swung open and they were invited in with a steady now some one was at the head showing rooms so that there was no delay for keys
toiling up the creaky stairs hurstwood looked back and saw the captain watching the last one of the line being included in his broad solicitude
then he gathered his cloak about him and strolled out into the night
i cant stand much of this said hurstwood whose legs ached him painfully as he sat down upon the miserable bunk in the small lightless chamber allotted to him
ive got to eat or ill die chapter xlvi
stirring troubled waters playing in new york one evening on this her return carrie was putting the finishing touches to her toilet before leaving for the night when a commotion near the stage door caught her ear
it included a familiar voice
never mind now
i want to see miss madenda youll have to send in your card oh come off
here a halfdollar was passed over and now a knock came at her dressingroom door
carrie opened it
well well said drouet
i do swear
why how are you
i knew that was you the moment i saw you carrie fell back a pace expecting a most embarrassing conversation
arent you going to shake hands with me
well youre a dandy
thats all right shake hands carrie put out her hand smiling if for nothing more than the mans exuberant goodnature
though older he was but slightly changed
the same fine clothes the same stocky body the same rosy countenance
that fellow at the door there didnt want to let me in until i paid him
i knew it was you all right
say youve got a great show
you do your part fine
i knew you would
i just happened to be passing tonight and thought id drop in for a few minutes
i saw your name on the programme but i didnt remember it until you came on the stage
then it struck me all at once
say you could have knocked me down with a feather
thats the same name you used out there in chicago isnt it yes answered carrie mildly overwhelmed by the mans assurance
i knew it was the moment i saw you
well how have you been anyhow oh very well said carrie lingering in her dressingroom
she was rather dazed by the assault
how have you been me
oh fine
im here now is that so said carrie
yes
ive been here for six months
ive got charge of a branch here how nice well when did you go on the stage anyhow inquired drouet
about three years ago said carrie
you dont say so
well sir this is the first ive heard of it
i knew you would though
i always said you could actdidnt i carrie smiled
yes you did she said
well you do look great he said
i never saw anybody improve so
youre taller arent you me
oh a little maybe he gazed at her dress then at her hair where a becoming hat was set jauntily then into her eyes which she took all occasion to avert
evidently he expected to restore their old friendship at once and without modification
well he said seeing her gather up her purse handkerchief and the like preparatory to departing i want you to come out to dinner with me wont you
ive got a friend out here oh i cant said carrie
not tonight
i have an early engagement tomorrow aw let the engagement go
come on
i can get rid of him
i want to have a good talk with you no no said carrie i cant
you mustnt ask me any more
i dont care for a late dinner well come on and have a talk then anyhow not tonight she said shaking her head
well have a talk some other time as a result of this she noticed a shade of thought pass over his face as if he were beginning to realise that things were changed
goodnature dictated something better than this for one who had always liked her
you come around to the hotel tomorrow she said as sort of penance for error
you can take dinner with me all right said drouet brightening
where are you stopping at the waldorf she answered mentioning the fashionable hostelry then but newly erected
what time well come at three said carrie pleasantly
the next day drouet called but it was with no especial delight that carrie remembered her appointment
however seeing him handsome as ever after his kind and most genially disposed her doubts as to whether the dinner would be disagreeable were swept away
he talked as volubly as ever
they put on a lot of lugs here dont they was his first remark
yes they do said carrie
genial egotist that he was he went at once into a detailed account of his own career
im going to have a business of my own pretty soon he observed in one place
i can get backing for two hundred thousand dollars carrie listened most goodnaturedly
say he said suddenly where is hurstwood now carrie flushed a little
hes here in new york i guess she said
i havent seen him for some time drouet mused for a moment
he had not been sure until now that the exmanager was not an influential figure in the background
he imagined not but this assurance relieved him
it must be that carrie had got rid of himas well she ought he thought
a man always makes a mistake when he does anything like that he observed
like what said carrie unwitting of what was coming
oh you know and drouet waved her intelligence as it were with his hand
no i dont she answered
what do you mean why that affair in chicagothe time he left i dont know what you are talking about said carrie
could it be he would refer so rudely to hurstwoods flight with her
oho said drouet incredulously
you knew he took ten thousand dollars with him when he left didnt you what said carrie
you dont mean to say he stole money do you why said drouet puzzled at her tone you knew that didnt you why no said carrie
of course i didnt well thats funny said drouet
he did you know
it was in all the papers how much did you say he took said carrie
ten thousand dollars
i heard he sent most of it back afterwards though carrie looked vacantly at the richly carpeted floor
a new light was shining upon all the years since her enforced flight
she remembered now a hundred things that indicated as much
she also imagined that he took it on her account
instead of hatred springing up there was a kind of sorrow generated
poor fellow
what a thing to have had hanging over his head all the time
at dinner drouet warmed up by eating and drinking and softened in mood fancied he was winning carrie to her oldtime goodnatured regard for him
he began to imagine it would not be so difficult to enter into her life again high as she was
ah what a prize
he thought
how beautiful how elegant how famous
in her theatrical and waldorf setting carrie was to him the all desirable
do you remember how nervous you were that night at the avery he asked
carrie smiled to think of it
i never saw anybody do better than you did then cad he added ruefully as he leaned an elbow on the table i thought you and i were going to get along fine those days you mustnt talk that way said carrie bringing in the least touch of coldness
wont you let me tell you no she answered rising
besides its time i was getting ready for the theatre
ill have to leave you
come now oh stay a minute pleaded drouet
youve got plenty of time no said carrie gently
reluctantly drouet gave up the bright table and followed
he saw her to the elevator and standing there said when do i see you again oh some time possibly said carrie
ill be here all summer
goodnight the elevator door was open
goodnight said drouet as she rustled in
then he strolled sadly down the hall all his old longing revived because she was now so far off
the merry froufrou of the place spoke all of her
he thought himself hardly dealt with
carrie however had other thoughts
that night it was that she passed hurstwood waiting at the casino without observing him
the next night walking to the theatre she encountered him face to face
he was waiting more gaunt than ever determined to see her if he had to send in word
at first she did not recognise the shabby baggy figure
he frightened her edging so close a seemingly hungry stranger
carrie he half whispered can i have a few words with you she turned and recognised him on the instant
if there ever had lurked any feeling in her heart against him it deserted her now
still she remembered what drouet said about his having stolen the money
why george she said whats the matter with you ive been sick he answered
ive just got out of the hospital
for gods sake let me have a little money will you of course said carrie her lip trembling in a strong effort to maintain her composure
but whats the matter with you anyhow she was opening her purse and now pulled out all the bills in ita five and two twos
ive been sick i told you he said peevishly almost resenting her excessive pity
it came hard to him to receive it from such a source
here she said
its all i have with me all right he answered softly
ill give it back to you some day carrie looked at him while pedestrians stared at her
she felt the strain of publicity
so did hurstwood
why dont you tell me whats the matter with you she asked hardly knowing what to do
where are you living oh ive got a room down in the bowery he answered
theres no use trying to tell you here
im all right now he seemed in a way to resent her kindly inquiriesso much better had fate dealt with her
better go on in he said
im much obliged but i wont bother you any more she tried to answer but he turned away and shuffled off toward the east
for days this apparition was a drag on her soul before it began to wear partially away
drouet called again but now he was not even seen by her
his attentions seemed out of place
im out was her reply to the boy
so peculiar indeed was her lonely selfwithdrawing temper that she was becoming an interesting figure in the public eyeshe was so quiet and reserved
not long after the management decided to transfer the show to london
a second summer season did not seem to promise well here
how would you like to try subduing london asked her manager one afternoon
it might be just the other way said carrie
i think well go in june he answered
in the hurry of departure hurstwood was forgotten
both he and drouet were left to discover that she was gone
the latter called once and exclaimed at the news
then he stood in the lobby chewing the ends of his moustache
at last he reached a conclusionthe old days had gone for good
she isnt so much he said but in his heart of hearts he did not believe this
hurstwood shifted by curious means through a long summer and fall
a small job as janitor of a dance hall helped him for a month
begging sometimes going hungry sometimes sleeping in the park carried him over more days
resorting to those peculiar charities several of which in the press of hungry search he accidentally stumbled upon did the rest
toward the dead of winter carrie came back appearing on broadway in a new play but he was not aware of it
for weeks he wandered about the city begging while the fire sign announcing her engagement blazed nightly upon the crowded street of amusements
drouet saw it but did not venture in
about this time ames returned to new york
he had made a little success in the west and now opened a laboratory in wooster street
of course he encountered carrie through mrs vance but there was nothing responsive between them
he thought she was still united to hurstwood until otherwise informed
not knowing the facts then he did not profess to understand and refrained from comment
with mrs vance he saw the new play and expressed himself accordingly
she ought not to be in comedy he said
i think she could do better than that one afternoon they met at the vances accidentally and began a very friendly conversation
she could hardly tell why the onetime keen interest in him was no longer with her
unquestionably it was because at that time he had represented something which she did not have but this she did not understand
success had given her the momentary feeling that she was now blessed with much of which he would approve
as a matter of fact her little newspaper fame was nothing at all to him
he thought she could have done better by far
you didnt go into comedydrama after all he said remembering her interest in that form of art
no she answered i havent so far he looked at her in such a peculiar way that she realised she had failed
it moved her to add i want to though i should think you would he said
you have the sort of disposition that would do well in comedydrama it surprised her that he should speak of disposition
was she then so clearly in his mind
why she asked
well he said i should judge you were rather sympathetic in your nature carrie smiled and coloured slightly
he was so innocently frank with her that she drew nearer in friendship
the old call of the ideal was sounding
i dont know she answered pleased nevertheless beyond all concealment
i saw your play he remarked
its very good im glad you liked it very good indeed he said for a comedy this is all that was said at the time owing to an interruption but later they met again
he was sitting in a corner after dinner staring at the floor when carrie came up with another of the guests
hard work had given his face the look of one who is weary
it was not for carrie to know the thing in it which appealed to her
all alone she said
i was listening to the music ill be back in a moment said her companion who saw nothing in the inventor
now he looked up in her face for she was standing a moment while he sat
isnt that a pathetic strain he inquired listening
oh very she returned also catching it now that her attention was called
sit down he added offering her the chair beside him
they listened a few moments in silence touched by the same feeling only hers reached her through the heart
music still charmed her as in the old days
i dont know what it is about music she started to say moved by the inexplicable longings which surged within her but it always makes me feel as if i wanted somethingi yes he replied i know how you feel suddenly he turned to considering the peculiarity of her disposition expressing her feelings so frankly
you ought not to be melancholy he said
he thought a while and then went off into a seemingly alien observation which however accorded with their feelings
the world is full of desirable situations but unfortunately we can occupy but one at a time
it doesnt do us any good to wring our hands over the faroff things the music ceased and he arose taking a standing position before her as if to rest himself
why dont you get into some good strong comedydrama he said
he was looking directly at her now studying her face
her large sympathetic eyes and paintouched mouth appealed to him as proofs of his judgment
perhaps i shall she returned
thats your field he added
do you think so yes he said i do
i dont suppose youre aware of it but there is something about your eyes and mouth which fits you for that sort of work carrie thrilled to be taken so seriously
for the moment loneliness deserted her
here was praise which was keen and analytical
its in your eyes and mouth he went on abstractedly
i remember thinking the first time i saw you that there was something peculiar about your mouth
i thought you were about to cry how odd said carrie warm with delight
this was what her heart craved
then i noticed that that was your natural look and tonight i saw it again
theres a shadow about your eyes too which gives your face much this same character
its in the depth of them i think carrie looked straight into his face wholly aroused
you probably are not aware of it he added
she looked away pleased that he should speak thus longing to be equal to this feeling written upon her countenance
it unlocked the door to a new desire
she had cause to ponder over this until they met againseveral weeks or more
it showed her she was drifting away from the old ideal which had filled her in the dressingrooms of the avery stage and thereafter for a long time
why had she lost it
i know why you should be a success he said another time if you had a more dramatic part
ive studied it out what is it said carrie
well he said as one pleased with a puzzle the expression in your face is one that comes out in different things
you get the same thing in a pathetic song or any picture which moves you deeply
its a thing the world likes to see because its a natural expression of its longing carrie gazed without exactly getting the import of what he meant
the world is always struggling to express itself he went on
most people are not capable of voicing their feelings
they depend upon others
that is what genius is for
one man expresses their desires for them in music another one in poetry another one in a play
sometimes nature does it in a faceit makes the face representative of all desire
thats what has happened in your case he looked at her with so much of the import of the thing in his eyes that she caught it
at least she got the idea that her look was something which represented the worlds longing
she took it to heart as a creditable thing until he added that puts a burden of duty on you
it so happens that you have this thing
it is no credit to youthat is i mean you might not have had it
you paid nothing to get it
but now that you have it you must do something with it what asked carrie
i should say turn to the dramatic field
you have so much sympathy and such a melodious voice
make them valuable to others
it will make your powers endure carrie did not understand this last
all the rest showed her that her comedy success was little or nothing
what do you mean she asked
why just this
you have this quality in your eyes and mouth and in your nature
you can lose it you know
if you turn away from it and live to satisfy yourself alone it will go fast enough
the look will leave your eyes
your mouth will change
your power to act will disappear
you may think they wont but they will
nature takes care of that he was so interested in forwarding all good causes that he sometimes became enthusiastic giving vent to these preachments
something in carrie appealed to him
he wanted to stir her up
i know she said absently feeling slightly guilty of neglect
if i were you he said id change the effect of this was like roiling helpless waters
carrie troubled over it in her rockingchair for days
i dont believe ill stay in comedy so very much longer she eventually remarked to lola
oh why not said the latter
i think she said i can do better in a serious play what put that idea in your head oh nothing she answered ive always thought so still she did nothinggrieving
it was a long way to this better thingor seemed soand comfort was about her hence the inactivity and longing
chapter xlvii
the way of the beaten a harp in the wind in the city at that time there were a number of charities similar in nature to that of the captains which hurstwood now patronised in a like unfortunate way
one was a convent missionhouse of the sisters of mercy in fifteenth streeta row of red brick family dwellings before the door of which hung a plain wooden contribution box on which was painted the statement that every noon a meal was given free to all those who might apply and ask for aid
this simple announcement was modest in the extreme covering as it did a charity so broad
institutions and charities are so large and so numerous in new york that such things as this are not often noticed by the more comfortably situated
but to one whose mind is upon the matter they grow exceedingly under inspection
unless one were looking up this matter in particular he could have stood at sixth avenue and fifteenth street for days around the noon hour and never have noticed that out of the vast crowd that surged along that busy thoroughfare there turned out every few seconds some weatherbeaten heavyfooted specimen of humanity gaunt in countenance and dilapidated in the matter of clothes
the fact is none the less true however and the colder the day the more apparent it became
space and a lack of culinary room in the missionhouse compelled an arrangement which permitted of only twentyfive or thirty eating at one time so that a line had to be formed outside and an orderly entrance effected
this caused a daily spectacle which however had become so common by repetition during a number of years that now nothing was thought of it
the men waited patiently like cattle in the coldest weatherwaited for several hours before they could be admitted
no questions were asked and no service rendered
they ate and went away again some of them returning regularly day after day the winter through
a big motherly looking woman invariably stood guard at the door during the entire operation and counted the admissible number
the men moved up in solemn order
there was no haste and no eagerness displayed
it was almost a dumb procession
in the bitterest weather this line was to be found here
under an icy wind there was a prodigious slapping of hands and a dancing of feet
fingers and the features of the face looked as if severely nipped by the cold
a study of these men in broad light proved them to be nearly all of a type
they belonged to the class that sit on the park benches during the endurable days and sleep upon them during the summer nights
they frequent the bowery and those downattheheels east side streets where poor clothes and shrunken features are not singled out as curious
they are the men who are in the lodginghouse sittingrooms during bleak and bitter weather and who swarm about the cheaper shelters which only open at six in a number of the lower east side streets
miserable food illtimed and greedily eaten had played havoc with bone and muscle
they were all pale flabby sunkeneyed hollowchested with eyes that glinted and shone and lips that were a sickly red by contrast
their hair was but half attended to their ears anmic in hue and their shoes broken in leather and run down at heel and toe
they were of the class which simply floats and drifts every wave of people washing up one as breakers do driftwood upon a stormy shore
for nearly a quarter of a century in another section of the city fleischmann the baker had given a loaf of bread to any one who would come for it to the side door of his restaurant at the corner of broadway and tenth street at midnight
every night during twenty years about three hundred men had formed in line and at the appointed time marched past the doorway picked their loaf from a great box placed just outside and vanished again into the night
from the beginning to the present time there had been little change in the character or number of these men
there were two or three figures that had grown familiar to those who had seen this little procession pass year after year
two of them had missed scarcely a night in fifteen years
there were about forty more or less regular callers
the remainder of the line was formed of strangers
in times of panic and unusual hardships there were seldom more than three hundred
in times of prosperity when little is heard of the unemployed there were seldom less
the same number winter and summer in storm or calm in good times and bad held this melancholy midnight rendezvous at fleischmanns bread box
at both of these two charities during the severe winter which was now on hurstwood was a frequent visitor
on one occasion it was peculiarly cold and finding no comfort in begging about the streets he waited until noon before seeking this free offering to the poor
already at eleven oclock of this morning several such as he had shambled forward out of sixth avenue their thin clothes flapping and fluttering in the wind
they leaned against the iron railing which protects the walls of the ninth regiment armory which fronts upon that section of fifteenth street having come early in order to be first in
having an hour to wait they at first lingered at a respectful distance but others coming up they moved closer in order to protect their right of precedence
to this collection hurstwood came up from the west out of seventh avenue and stopped close to the door nearer than all the others
those who had been waiting before him but farther away now drew near and by a certain stolidity of demeanour no words being spoken indicated that they were first
seeing the opposition to his action he looked sullenly along the line then moved out taking his place at the foot
when order had been restored the animal feeling of opposition relaxed
must be pretty near noon ventured one
it is said another
ive been waiting nearly an hour gee but its cold they peered eagerly at the door where all must enter
a grocery man drove up and carried in several baskets of eatables
this started some words upon grocery men and the cost of food in general
i see meats gone up said one
if there wuz war it would help this country a lot the line was growing rapidly
already there were fifty or more and those at the head by their demeanour evidently congratulated themselves upon not having so long to wait as those at the foot
there was much jerking of heads and looking down the line
it dont matter how near you get to the front so long as youre in the first twentyfive commented one of the first twentyfive
you all go in together humph ejaculated hurstwood who had been so sturdily displaced
this here single tax is the thing said another
there aint going to be no order till it comes for the most part there was silence gaunt men shuffling glancing and beating their arms
at last the door opened and the motherlylooking sister appeared
she only looked an order
slowly the line moved up and one by one passed in until twentyfive were counted
then she interposed a stout arm and the line halted with six men on the steps
of these the exmanager was one
waiting thus some talked some ejaculated concerning the misery of it some brooded as did hurstwood
at last he was admitted and having eaten came away almost angered because of his pains in getting it
at eleven oclock of another evening perhaps two weeks later he was at the midnight offering of a loafwaiting patiently
it had been an unfortunate day with him but now he took his fate with a touch of philosophy
if he could secure no supper or was hungry late in the evening here was a place he could come
a few minutes before twelve a great box of bread was pushed out and exactly on the hour a portly roundfaced german took position by it calling ready the whole line at once moved forward each taking his loaf in turn and going his separate way
on this occasion the exmanager ate his as he went plodding the dark streets in silence to his bed
by january he had about concluded that the game was up with him
life had always seemed a precious thing but now constant want and weakened vitality had made the charms of earth rather dull and inconspicuous
several times when fortune pressed most harshly he thought he would end his troubles but with a change of weather or the arrival of a quarter or a dime his mood would change and he would wait
each day he would find some old paper lying about and look into it to see if there was any trace of carrie but all summer and fall he had looked in vain
then he noticed that his eyes were beginning to hurt him and this ailment rapidly increased until in the dark chambers of the lodgings he frequented he did not attempt to read
bad and irregular eating was weakening every function of his body
the one recourse left him was to doze when a place offered and he could get the money to occupy it
he was beginning to find in his wretched clothing and meagre state of body that people took him for a chronic type of bum and beggar
police hustled him along restaurant and lodginghouse keepers turned him out promptly the moment he had his due pedestrians waved him off
he found it more and more difficult to get anything from anybody
at last he admitted to himself that the game was up
it was after a long series of appeals to pedestrians in which he had been refused and refusedevery one hastening from contact
give me a little something will you mister he said to the last one
for gods sake do im starving aw get out said the man who happened to be a common type himself
youre no good
ill give you nawthin hurstwood put his hands red from cold down in his pockets
tears came into his eyes
thats right he said im no good now
i was all right
i had money
im going to quit this and with death in his heart he started down toward the bowery
people had turned on the gas before and died why shouldnt he
he remembered a lodginghouse where there were little close rooms with gasjets in them almost prearranged he thought for what he wanted to do which rented for fifteen cents
then he remembered that he had no fifteen cents
on the way he met a comfortablelooking gentleman coming cleanshaven out of a fine barber shop
would you mind giving me a little something he asked this man boldly
the gentleman looked him over and fished for a dime
nothing but quarters were in his pocket
here he said handing him one to be rid of him
be off now hurstwood moved on wondering
the sight of the large bright coin pleased him a little
he remembered that he was hungry and that he could get a bed for ten cents
with this the idea of death passed for the time being out of his mind
it was only when he could get nothing but insults that death seemed worth while
one day in the middle of the winter the sharpest spell of the season set in
it broke grey and cold in the first day and on the second snowed
poor luck pursuing him he had secured but ten cents by nightfall and this he had spent for food
at evening he found himself at the boulevard and sixtyseventh street where he finally turned his face boweryward
especially fatigued because of the wandering propensity which had seized him in the morning he now half dragged his wet feet shuffling the soles upon the sidewalk
an old thin coat was turned up about his red earshis cracked derby hat was pulled down until it turned them outward
his hands were in his pockets
ill just go down broadway he said to himself
when he reached fortysecond street the fire signs were already blazing brightly
crowds were hastening to dine
through bright windows at every corner might be seen gay companies in luxuriant restaurants
there were coaches and crowded cable cars
in his weary and hungry state he should never have come here
the contrast was too sharp
even he was recalled keenly to better things
whats the use he thought
its all up with me
ill quit this people turned to look after him so uncouth was his shambling figure
several officers followed him with their eyes to see that he did not beg of anybody
once he paused in an aimless incoherent sort of way and looked through the windows of an imposing restaurant before which blazed a fire sign and through the large plate windows of which could be seen the red and gold decorations the palms the white napery and shining glassware and above all the comfortable crowd
weak as his mind had become his hunger was sharp enough to show the importance of this
he stopped stock still his frayed trousers soaking in the slush and peered foolishly in
eat he mumbled
thats right eat
nobody else wants any then his voice dropped even lower and his mind half lost the fancy it had
its mighty cold he said
awful cold at broadway and thirtyninth street was blazing in incandescent fire carries name
carrie madenda it read and the casino company all the wet snowy sidewalk was bright with this radiated fire
it was so bright that it attracted hurstwoods gaze
he looked up and then at a large giltframed posterboard on which was a fine lithograph of carrie lifesize
hurstwood gazed at it a moment snuffling and hunching one shoulder as if something were scratching him
he was so run down however that his mind was not exactly clear
he approached that entrance and went in
well said the attendant staring at him
seeing him pause he went over and shoved him
get out of here he said
i want to see miss madenda he said
you do eh the other said almost tickled at the spectacle
get out of here and he shoved him again
hurstwood had no strength to resist
i want to see miss madenda he tried to explain even as he was being hustled away
im all right
i the man gave him a last push and closed the door
as he did so hurstwood slipped and fell in the snow
it hurt him and some vague sense of shame returned
he began to cry and swear foolishly
god damned dog he said
damned old cur wiping the slush from his worthless coat
ii hired such people as you once now a fierce feeling against carrie welled upjust one fierce angry thought before the whole thing slipped out of his mind
she owes me something to eat he said
she owes it to me hopelessly he turned back into broadway again and slopped onward and away begging crying losing track of his thoughts one after another as a mind decayed and disjointed is wont to do
it was truly a wintry evening a few days later when his one distinct mental decision was reached
already at four oclock the sombre hue of night was thickening the air
a heavy snow was fallinga fine picking whipping snow borne forward by a swift wind in long thin lines
the streets were bedded with itsix inches of cold soft carpet churned to a dirty brown by the crush of teams and the feet of men
along broadway men picked their way in ulsters and umbrellas
along the bowery men slouched through it with collars and hats pulled over their ears
in the former thoroughfare businessmen and travellers were making for comfortable hotels
in the latter crowds on cold errands shifted past dingy stores in the deep recesses of which lights were already gleaming
there were early lights in the cable cars whose usual clatter was reduced by the mantle about the wheels
the whole city was muffled by this fastthickening mantle
in her comfortable chambers at the waldorf carrie was reading at this time pre goriot which ames had recommended to her
it was so strong and amess mere recommendation had so aroused her interest that she caught nearly the full sympathetic significance of it
for the first time it was being borne in upon her how silly and worthless had been her earlier reading as a whole
becoming wearied however she yawned and came to the window looking out upon the old winding procession of carriages rolling up fifth avenue
isnt it bad she observed to lola
terrible said that little lady joining her
i hope it snows enough to go sleigh riding oh dear said carrie with whom the sufferings of father goriot were still keen
thats all you think of
arent you sorry for the people who havent anything tonight of course i am said lola but what can i do
i havent anything carrie smiled
you wouldnt care if you had she returned
i would too said lola
but people never gave me anything when i was hard up isnt it just awful said carrie studying the winters storm
look at that man over there laughed lola who had caught sight of some one falling down
how sheepish men look when they fall dont they well have to take a coach tonight answered carrie absently
in the lobby of the imperial mr charles drouet was just arriving shaking the snow from a very handsome ulster
bad weather had driven him home early and stirred his desire for those pleasures which shut out the snow and gloom of life
a good dinner the company of a young woman and an evening at the theatre were the chief things for him
why hello harry he said addressing a lounger in one of the comfortable lobby chairs
how are you oh about six and six said the other
rotten weather isnt it well i should say said the other
ive been just sitting here thinking where id go tonight come along with me said drouet
i can introduce you to something dead swell who is it said the other
oh a couple of girls over here in fortieth street
we could have a dandy time
i was just looking for you supposing you get em and take em out to dinner sure said drouet
waitll i go upstairs and change my clothes well ill be in the barber shop said the other
i want to get a shave all right said drouet creaking off in his good shoes toward the elevator
the old butterfly was as light on the wing as ever
on an incoming vestibuled pullman speeding at forty miles an hour through the snow of the evening were three others all related
first call for dinner in the diningcar a pullman servitor was announcing as he hastened through the aisle in snowwhite apron and jacket
i dont believe i want to play any more said the youngest a blackhaired beauty turned supercilious by fortune as she pushed a euchre hand away from her
shall we go into dinner inquired her husband who was all that fine raiment can make
oh not yet she answered
i dont want to play any more though jessica said her mother who was also a study in what good clothing can do for age push that pin down in your tieits coming up jessica obeyed incidentally touching at her lovely hair and looking at a little jewelfaced watch
her husband studied her for beauty even cold is fascinating from one point of view
well we wont have much more of this weather he said
it only takes two weeks to get to rome mrs hurstwood nestled comfortably in her corner and smiled
it was so nice to be the motherinlaw of a rich young manone whose financial state had borne her personal inspection
do you suppose the boat will sail promptly asked jessica if it keeps up like this oh yes answered her husband
this wont make any difference passing down the aisle came a very fairhaired bankers son also of chicago who had long eyed this supercilious beauty
even now he did not hesitate to glance at her and she was conscious of it
with a specially conjured show of indifference she turned her pretty face wholly away
it was not wifely modesty at all
by so much was her pride satisfied
at this moment hurstwood stood before a dirty four story building in a side street quite near the bowery whose onetime coat of buff had been changed by soot and rain
he mingled with a crowd of mena crowd which had been and was still gathering by degrees
it began with the approach of two or three who hung about the closed wooden doors and beat their feet to keep them warm
they had on faded derby hats with dents in them
their misfit coats were heavy with melted snow and turned up at the collars
their trousers were mere bags frayed at the bottom and wobbling over big soppy shoes torn at the sides and worn almost to shreds
they made no effort to go in but shifted ruefully about digging their hands deep in their pockets and leering at the crowd and the increasing lamps
with the minutes increased the number
there were old men with grizzled beards and sunken eyes men who were comparatively young but shrunken by diseases men who were middleaged
none were fat
there was a face in the thick of the collection which was as white as drained veal
there was another red as brick
some came with thin rounded shoulders others with wooden legs still others with frames so lean that clothes only flapped about them
there were great ears swollen noses thick lips and above all red bloodshot eyes
not a normal healthy face in the whole mass not a straight figure not a straightforward steady glance
in the drive of the wind and sleet they pushed in on one another
there were wrists unprotected by coat or pocket which were red with cold
there were ears half covered by every conceivable semblance of a hat which still looked stiff and bitten
in the snow they shifted now one foot now another almost rocking in unison
with the growth of the crowd about the door came a murmur
it was not conversation but a running comment directed at any one in general
it contained oaths and slang phrases
by damn i wish theyd hurry up look at the copper watchin maybe it aint winter nuther i wisht i was in sing sing now a sharper lash of wind cut down and they huddled closer
it was an edging shifting pushing throng
there was no anger no pleading no threatening words
it was all sullen endurance unlightened by either wit or good fellowship
a carriage went jingling by with some reclining figure in it
one of the men nearest the door saw it
look at the bloke ridin he aint so cold eh eh eh yelled another the carriage having long since passed out of hearing
little by little the night crept on
along the walk a crowd turned out on its way home
men and shopgirls went by with quick steps
the crosstown cars began to be crowded
the gas lamps were blazing and every window bloomed ruddy with a steady flame
still the crowd hung about the door unwavering
aint they ever goin to open up queried a hoarse voice suggestively
this seemed to renew the general interest in the closed door and many gazed in that direction
they looked at it as dumb brutes look as dogs paw and whine and study the knob
they shifted and blinked and muttered now a curse now a comment
still they waited and still the snow whirled and cut them with biting flakes
on the old hats and peaked shoulders it was piling
it gathered in little heaps and curves and no one brushed it off
in the centre of the crowd the warmth and steam melted it and water trickled off hat rims and down noses which the owners could not reach to scratch
on the outer rim the piles remained unmelted
hurstwood who could not get in the centre stood with head lowered to the weather and bent his form
a light appeared through the transom overhead
it sent a thrill of possibility through the watchers
there was a murmur of recognition
at last the bars grated inside and the crowd pricked up its ears
footsteps shuffled within and it murmured again
some one called slow up there now and then the door opened
it was push and jam for a minute with grim beast silence to prove its quality and then it melted inward like logs floating and disappeared
there were wet hats and wet shoulders a cold shrunken disgruntled mass pouring in between bleak walls
it was just six oclock and there was supper in every hurrying pedestrians face
and yet no supper was provided herenothing but beds
hurstwood laid down his fifteen cents and crept off with weary steps to his allotted room
it was a dingy affairwooden dusty hard
a small gasjet furnished sufficient light for so rueful a corner
hm he said clearing his throat and locking the door
now he began leisurely to take off his clothes but stopped first with his coat and tucked it along the crack under the door
his vest he arranged in the same place
his old wet cracked hat he laid softly upon the table
then he pulled off his shoes and lay down
it seemed as if he thought a while for now he arose and turned the gas out standing calmly in the blackness hidden from view
after a few moments in which he reviewed nothing but merely hesitated he turned the gas on again but applied no match
even then he stood there hidden wholly in that kindness which is night while the uprising fumes filled the room
when the odour reached his nostrils he quit his attitude and fumbled for the bed
whats the use he said weakly as he stretched himself to rest
and now carrie had attained that which in the beginning seemed lifes object or at least such fraction of it as human beings ever attain of their original desires
she could look about on her gowns and carriage her furniture and bank account
friends there were as the world takes itthose who would bow and smile in acknowledgment of her success
for these she had once craved
applause there was and publicityonce far off essential things but now grown trivial and indifferent
beauty alsoher type of lovelinessand yet she was lonely
in her rockingchair she sat when not otherwise engagedsinging and dreaming
thus in life there is ever the intellectual and the emotional naturethe mind that reasons and the mind that feels
of one come the men of actiongenerals and statesmen of the other the poets and dreamersartists all
as harps in the wind the latter respond to every breath of fancy voicing in their moods all the ebb and flow of the ideal
man has not yet comprehended the dreamer any more than he has the ideal
for him the laws and morals of the world are unduly severe
ever hearkening to the sound of beauty straining for the flash of its distant wings he watches to follow wearying his feet in travelling
so watched carrie so followed rocking and singing
and it must be remembered that reason had little part in this
chicago dawning she saw the city offering more of loveliness than she had ever known and instinctively by force of her moods alone clung to it
in fine raiment and elegant surroundings men seemed to be contented
hence she drew near these things
chicago new york drouet hurstwood the world of fashion and the world of stagethese were but incidents
not them but that which they represented she longed for
time proved the representation false
oh the tangle of human life
how dimly as yet we see
here was carrie in the beginning poor unsophisticated emotional responding with desire to everything most lovely in life yet finding herself turned as by a wall
laws to say be allured if you will by everything lovely but draw not nigh unless by righteousness convention to say you shall not better your situation save by honest labour if honest labour be unremunerative and difficult to endure if it be the long long road which never reaches beauty but wearies the feet and the heart if the drag to follow beauty be such that one abandons the admired way taking rather the despised path leading to her dreams quickly who shall cast the first stone
not evil but longing for that which is better more often directs the steps of the erring
not evil but goodness more often allures the feeling mind unused to reason
amid the tinsel and shine of her state walked carrie unhappy
as when drouet took her she had thought now i am lifted into that which is best as when hurstwood seemingly offered her the better way now am i happy but since the world goes its way past all who will not partake of its folly she now found herself alone
her purse was open to him whose need was greatest
in her walks on broadway she no longer thought of the elegance of the creatures who passed her
had they more of that peace and beauty which glimmered afar off then were they to be envied
drouet abandoned his claim and was seen no more
of hurstwoods death she was not even aware
a slow black boat setting out from the pier at twentyseventh street upon its weekly errand bore with many others his nameless body to the potters field
thus passed all that was of interest concerning these twain in their relation to her
their influence upon her life is explicable alone by the nature of her longings
time was when both represented for her all that was most potent in earthly success
they were the personal representatives of a state most blessed to attainthe titled ambassadors of comfort and peace aglow with their credentials
it is but natural that when the world which they represented no longer allured her its ambassadors should be discredited
even had hurstwood returned in his original beauty and glory he could not now have allured her
she had learned that in his world as in her own present state was not happiness
sitting alone she was now an illustration of the devious ways by which one who feels rather than reasons may be led in the pursuit of beauty
though often disillusioned she was still waiting for that halcyon day when she would be led forth among dreams become real
ames had pointed out a farther step but on and on beyond that if accomplished would lie others for her
it was forever to be the pursuit of that radiance of delight which tints the distant hilltops of the world
oh carrie carrie
oh blind strivings of the human heart
onward onward it saith and where beauty leads there it follows
whether it be the tinkle of a lone sheep bell oer some quiet landscape or the glimmer of beauty in sylvan places or the show of soul in some passing eye the heart knows and makes answer following
it is when the feet weary and hope seems vain that the heartaches and the longings arise
know then that for you is neither surfeit nor content
in your rockingchair by your window dreaming shall you long alone
in your rockingchair by your window shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel
