i   a green and yellow parrot which hung in a cage outside the door kept repeating over and over  allez vousen
allez vousen
sapristi
that's all right  he could speak a little spanish and also a language which nobody understood unless it was the mockingbird that hung on the other side of the door whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening persistence
mr pontellier unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust
he walked down the gallery and across the narrow bridges which connected the lebrun cottages one with the other
he had been seated before the door of the main house
the parrot and the mockingbird were the property of madame lebrun and they had the right to make all the noise they wished
mr pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be entertaining
he stopped before the door of his own cottage which was the fourth one from the main building and next to the last
seating himself in a wicker rocker which was there he once more applied himself to the task of reading the newspaper
the day was sunday the paper was a day old
the sunday papers had not yet reached grand isle
he was already acquainted with the market reports and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting new orleans the day before
mr pontellier wore eyeglasses
he was a man of forty of medium height and rather slender build he stooped a little
his hair was brown and straight parted on one side
his beard was neatly and closely trimmed
once in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about him
there was more noise than ever over at the house
the main building was called the house to distinguish it from the cottages
the chattering and whistling birds were still at it
two young girls the farival twins were playing a duet from zampa upon the piano
madame lebrun was bustling in and out giving orders in a high key to a yardboy whenever she got inside the house and directions in an equally high voice to a diningroom servant whenever she got outside
she was a fresh pretty woman clad always in white with elbow sleeves
her starched skirts crinkled as she came and went
farther down before one of the cottages a lady in black was walking demurely up and down telling her beads
a good many persons of the pension had gone over to the cheniere caminada in beaudelet's lugger to hear mass
some young people were out under the wateroaks playing croquet
mr pontellier's two children were theresturdy little fellows of four and five
a quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway meditative air
mr pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke letting the paper drag idly from his hand
he fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail's pace from the beach
he could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the wateroaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile
the gulf looked far away melting hazily into the blue of the horizon
the sunshade continued to approach slowly
beneath its pinklined shelter were his wife mrs pontellier and young robert lebrun
when they reached the cottage the two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch facing each other each leaning against a supporting post
what folly
to bathe at such an hour in such heat exclaimed mr pontellier
he himself had taken a plunge at daylight
that was why the morning seemed long to him
you are burnt beyond recognition he added looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage
she held up her hands strong shapely hands and surveyed them critically drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists
looking at them reminded her of her rings which she had given to her husband before leaving for the beach
she silently reached out to him and he understanding took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm
she slipped them upon her fingers then clasping her knees she looked across at robert and began to laugh
the rings sparkled upon her fingers
he sent back an answering smile
what is it asked pontellier looking lazily and amused from one to the other
it was some utter nonsense some adventure out there in the water and they both tried to relate it at once
it did not seem half so amusing when told
they realized this and so did mr pontellier
he yawned and stretched himself
then he got up saying he had half a mind to go over to klein's hotel and play a game of billiards
come go along lebrun he proposed to robert
but robert admitted quite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to mrs pontellier
well send him about his business when he bores you edna instructed her husband as he prepared to leave
here take the umbrella she exclaimed holding it out to him
he accepted the sunshade and lifting it over his head descended the steps and walked away
coming back to dinner his wife called after him
he halted a moment and shrugged his shoulders
he felt in his vest pocket there was a tendollar bill there
he did not know perhaps he would return for the early dinner and perhaps he would not
it all depended upon the company which he found over at klein's and the size of the game he did not say this but she understood it and laughed nodding goodby to him
both children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting out
he kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts
ii   mrs pontellier's eyes were quick and bright they were a yellowish brown about the color of her hair
she had a way of turning them swiftly upon an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward maze of contemplation or thought
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
robert rolled a cigarette
he smoked cigarettes because he could not afford cigars he said
he had a cigar in his pocket which mr pontellier had presented him with and he was saving it for his afterdinner smoke
this seemed quite proper and natural on his part
in coloring he was not unlike his companion
a cleanshaved face made the resemblance more pronounced than it would otherwise have been
there rested no shadow of care upon his open countenance
his eyes gathered in and reflected the light and languor of the summer day
mrs pontellier reached over for a palmleaf fan that lay on the porch and began to fan herself while robert sent between his lips light puffs from his cigarette
they chatted incessantly about the things around them their amusing adventure out in the waterit had again assumed its entertaining aspect about the wind the trees the people who had gone to the cheniere about the children playing croquet under the oaks and the farival twins who were now performing the overture to the poet and the peasant  robert talked a good deal about himself
he was very young and did not know any better
mrs pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason
each was interested in what the other said
robert spoke of his intention to go to mexico in the autumn where fortune awaited him
he was always intending to go to mexico but some way never got there
meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in new orleans where an equal familiarity with english french and spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent
he was spending his summer vacation as he always did with his mother at grand isle
in former times before robert could remember the house had been a summer luxury of the lebruns
now flanked by its dozen or more cottages which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the quartier francais it enabled madame lebrun to maintain the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright
mrs pontellier talked about her father's mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in the old kentucky bluegrass country
she was an american woman with a small infusion of french which seemed to have been lost in dilution
she read a letter from her sister who was away in the east and who had engaged herself to be married
robert was interested and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were what the father was like and how long the mother had been dead
when mrs pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for the early dinner
i see leonce isn't coming back she said with a glance in the direction whence her husband had disappeared
robert supposed he was not as there were a good many new orleans club men over at klein's
when mrs pontellier left him to enter her room the young man descended the steps and strolled over toward the croquet players where during the halfhour before dinner he amused himself with the little pontellier children who were very fond of him
iii   it was eleven o'clock that night when mr pontellier returned from klein's hotel
he was in an excellent humor in high spirits and very talkative
his entrance awoke his wife who was in bed and fast asleep when he came in
he talked to her while he undressed telling her anecdotes and bits of news and gossip that he had gathered during the day
from his trousers pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes and a good deal of silver coin which he piled on the bureau indiscriminately with keys knife handkerchief and whatever else happened to be in his pockets
she was overcome with sleep and answered him with little half utterances
he thought it very discouraging that his wife who was the sole object of his existence evinced so little interest in things which concerned him and valued so little his conversation
mr pontellier had forgotten the bonbons and peanuts for the boys
notwithstanding he loved them very much and went into the adjoining room where they slept to take a look at them and make sure that they were resting comfortably
the result of his investigation was far from satisfactory
he turned and shifted the youngsters about in bed
one of them began to kick and talk about a basket full of crabs
mr pontellier returned to his wife with the information that raoul had a high fever and needed looking after
then he lit a cigar and went and sat near the open door to smoke it
mrs pontellier was quite sure raoul had no fever
he had gone to bed perfectly well she said and nothing had ailed him all day
mr pontellier was too well acquainted with fever symptoms to be mistaken
he assured her the child was consuming at that moment in the next room
he reproached his wife with her inattention her habitual neglect of the children
if it was not a mother's place to look after children whose on earth was it
he himself had his hands full with his brokerage business
he could not be in two places at once making a living for his family on the street and staying at home to see that no harm befell them
he talked in a monotonous insistent way
mrs pontellier sprang out of bed and went into the next room
she soon came back and sat on the edge of the bed leaning her head down on the pillow
she said nothing and refused to answer her husband when he questioned her
when his cigar was smoked out he went to bed and in half a minute he was fast asleep
mrs pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake
she began to cry a little and wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her peignoir
blowing out the candle which her husband had left burning she slipped her bare feet into a pair of satin mules at the foot of the bed and went out on the porch where she sat down in the wicker chair and began to rock gently to and fro
it was then past midnight
the cottages were all dark
a single faint light gleamed out from the hallway of the house
there was no sound abroad except the hooting of an old owl in the top of a wateroak and the everlasting voice of the sea that was not uplifted at that soft hour
it broke like a mournful lullaby upon the night
the tears came so fast to mrs pontellier's eyes that the damp sleeve of her peignoir no longer served to dry them
she was holding the back of her chair with one hand her loose sleeve had slipped almost to the shoulder of her uplifted arm
turning she thrust her face steaming and wet into the bend of her arm and she went on crying there not caring any longer to dry her face her eyes her arms
she could not have told why she was crying
such experiences as the foregoing were not uncommon in her married life
they seemed never before to have weighed much against the abundance of her husband's kindness and a uniform devotion which had come to be tacit and selfunderstood
an indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her soul's summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
the little stinging buzzing imps succeeded in dispelling a mood which might have held her there in the darkness half a night longer
the following morning mr pontellier was up in good time to take the rockaway which was to convey him to the steamer at the wharf
he was returning to the city to his business and they would not see him again at the island till the coming saturday
he had regained his composure which seemed to have been somewhat impaired the night before
he was eager to be gone as he looked forward to a lively week in carondelet street
mr pontellier gave his wife half of the money which he had brought away from klein's hotel the evening before
she liked money as well as most women and accepted it with no little satisfaction
it will buy a handsome wedding present for sister janet she exclaimed smoothing out the bills as she counted them one by one
oh
we'll treat sister janet better than that my dear he laughed as he prepared to kiss her goodby
the boys were tumbling about clinging to his legs imploring that numerous things be brought back to them
mr pontellier was a great favorite and ladies men children even nurses were always on hand to say goodby to him
his wife stood smiling and waving the boys shouting as he disappeared in the old rockaway down the sandy road
a few days later a box arrived for mrs pontellier from new orleans
it was from her husband
it was filled with friandises with luscious and toothsome bitsthe finest of fruits pates a rare bottle or two delicious syrups and bonbons in abundance
mrs pontellier was always very generous with the contents of such a box she was quite used to receiving them when away from home
the pates and fruit were brought to the diningroom the bonbons were passed around
and the ladies selecting with dainty and discriminating fingers and a little greedily all declared that mr pontellier was the best husband in the world
mrs pontellier was forced to admit that she knew of none better
iv   it would have been a difficult matter for mr pontellier to define to his own satisfaction or any one else's wherein his wife failed in her duty toward their children
it was something which he felt rather than perceived and he never voiced the feeling without subsequent regret and ample atonement
if one of the little pontellier boys took a tumble whilst at play he was not apt to rush crying to his mother's arms for comfort he would more likely pick himself up wipe the water out of his eyes and the sand out of his mouth and go on playing
tots as they were they pulled together and stood their ground in childish battles with doubled fists and uplifted voices which usually prevailed against the other mothertots
the quadroon nurse was looked upon as a huge encumbrance only good to button up waists and panties and to brush and part hair since it seemed to be a law of society that hair must be parted and brushed
in short mrs pontellier was not a motherwoman
the motherwomen seemed to prevail that summer at grand isle
it was easy to know them fluttering about with extended protecting wings when any harm real or imaginary threatened their precious brood
they were women who idolized their children worshiped their husbands and esteemed it a holy privilege to efface themselves as individuals and grow wings as ministering angels
many of them were delicious in the role one of them was the embodiment of every womanly grace and charm
if her husband did not adore her he was a brute deserving of death by slow torture
her name was adele ratignolle
there are no words to describe her save the old ones that have served so often to picture the bygone heroine of romance and the fair lady of our dreams
there was nothing subtle or hidden about her charms her beauty was all there flaming and apparent the spungold hair that comb nor confining pin could restrain the blue eyes that were like nothing but sapphires two lips that pouted that were so red one could only think of cherries or some other delicious crimson fruit in looking at them
she was growing a little stout but it did not seem to detract an iota from the grace of every step pose gesture
one would not have wanted her white neck a mite less full or her beautiful arms more slender
never were hands more exquisite than hers and it was a joy to look at them when she threaded her needle or adjusted her gold thimble to her taper middle finger as she sewed away on the little nightdrawers or fashioned a bodice or a bib
madame ratignolle was very fond of mrs pontellier and often she took her sewing and went over to sit with her in the afternoons
she was sitting there the afternoon of the day the box arrived from new orleans
she had possession of the rocker and she was busily engaged in sewing upon a diminutive pair of nightdrawers
she had brought the pattern of the drawers for mrs pontellier to cut outa marvel of construction fashioned to enclose a baby's body so effectually that only two small eyes might look out from the garment like an eskimo's
they were designed for winter wear when treacherous drafts came down chimneys and insidious currents of deadly cold found their way through keyholes
mrs pontellier's mind was quite at rest concerning the present material needs of her children and she could not see the use of anticipating and making winter night garments the subject of her summer meditations
but she did not want to appear unamiable and uninterested so she had brought forth newspapers which she spread upon the floor of the gallery and under madame ratignolle's directions she had cut a pattern of the impervious garment
robert was there seated as he had been the sunday before and mrs pontellier also occupied her former position on the upper step leaning listlessly against the post
beside her was a box of bonbons which she held out at intervals to madame ratignolle
that lady seemed at a loss to make a selection but finally settled upon a stick of nougat wondering if it were not too rich whether it could possibly hurt her
madame ratignolle had been married seven years
about every two years she had a baby
at that time she had three babies and was beginning to think of a fourth one
she was always talking about her condition her condition was in no way apparent and no one would have known a thing about it but for her persistence in making it the subject of conversation
robert started to reassure her asserting that he had known a lady who had subsisted upon nougat during the entirebut seeing the color mount into mrs pontellier's face he checked himself and changed the subject
mrs pontellier though she had married a creole was not thoroughly at home in the society of creoles never before had she been thrown so intimately among them
there were only creoles that summer at lebrun's
they all knew each other and felt like one large family among whom existed the most amicable relations
a characteristic which distinguished them and which impressed mrs pontellier most forcibly was their entire absence of prudery
their freedom of expression was at first incomprehensible to her though she had no difficulty in reconciling it with a lofty chastity which in the creole woman seems to be inborn and unmistakable
never would edna pontellier forget the shock with which she heard madame ratignolle relating to old monsieur farival the harrowing story of one of her accouchements withholding no intimate detail
she was growing accustomed to like shocks but she could not keep the mounting color back from her cheeks
oftener than once her coming had interrupted the droll story with which robert was entertaining some amused group of married women
a book had gone the rounds of the pension
when it came her turn to read it she did so with profound astonishment
she felt moved to read the book in secret and solitude though none of the others had done soto hide it from view at the sound of approaching footsteps
it was openly criticised and freely discussed at table
mrs pontellier gave over being astonished and concluded that wonders would never cease
v   they formed a congenial group sitting there that summer afternoonmadame ratignolle sewing away often stopping to relate a story or incident with much expressive gesture of her perfect hands robert and mrs pontellier sitting idle exchanging occasional words glances or smiles which indicated a certain advanced stage of intimacy and camaraderie
he had lived in her shadow during the past month
no one thought anything of it
many had predicted that robert would devote himself to mrs pontellier when he arrived
since the age of fifteen which was eleven years before robert each summer at grand isle had constituted himself the devoted attendant of some fair dame or damsel
sometimes it was a young girl again a widow but as often as not it was some interesting married woman
for two consecutive seasons he lived in the sunlight of mademoiselle duvigne's presence
but she died between summers then robert posed as an inconsolable prostrating himself at the feet of madame ratignolle for whatever crumbs of sympathy and comfort she might be pleased to vouchsafe
mrs pontellier liked to sit and gaze at her fair companion as she might look upon a faultless madonna
could any one fathom the cruelty beneath that fair exterior murmured robert
she knew that i adored her once and she let me adore her
it was 'robert come go stand up sit down do this do that see if the baby sleeps my thimble please that i left god knows where
come and read daudet to me while i sew
'  par exemple
i never had to ask
you were always there under my feet like a troublesome cat  you mean like an adoring dog
and just as soon as ratignolle appeared on the scene then it was like a dog
'passez
adieu
allez vousen
'  perhaps i feared to make alphonse jealous she interjoined with excessive naivete
that made them all laugh
the right hand jealous of the left
the heart jealous of the soul
but for that matter the creole husband is never jealous with him the gangrene passion is one which has become dwarfed by disuse
meanwhile robert addressing mrs pontellier continued to tell of his one time hopeless passion for madame ratignolle of sleepless nights of consuming flames till the very sea sizzled when he took his daily plunge
while the lady at the needle kept up a little running contemptuous comment  blagueurfarceurgros bete va  he never assumed this seriocomic tone when alone with mrs pontellier
she never knew precisely what to make of it at that moment it was impossible for her to guess how much of it was jest and what proportion was earnest
it was understood that he had often spoken words of love to madame ratignolle without any thought of being taken seriously
mrs pontellier was glad he had not assumed a similar role toward herself
it would have been unacceptable and annoying
mrs pontellier had brought her sketching materials which she sometimes dabbled with in an unprofessional way
she liked the dabbling
she felt in it satisfaction of a kind which no other employment afforded her
she had long wished to try herself on madame ratignolle
never had that lady seemed a more tempting subject than at that moment seated there like some sensuous madonna with the gleam of the fading day enriching her splendid color
robert crossed over and seated himself upon the step below mrs pontellier that he might watch her work
she handled her brushes with a certain ease and freedom which came not from long and close acquaintance with them but from a natural aptitude
robert followed her work with close attention giving forth little ejaculatory expressions of appreciation in french which he addressed to madame ratignolle
mais ce n'est pas mal
elle s'y connait elle a de la force oui  during his oblivious attention he once quietly rested his head against mrs pontellier's arm
as gently she repulsed him
once again he repeated the offense
she could not but believe it to be thoughtlessness on his part yet that was no reason she should submit to it
she did not remonstrate except again to repulse him quietly but firmly
he offered no apology
the picture completed bore no resemblance to madame ratignolle
she was greatly disappointed to find that it did not look like her
but it was a fair enough piece of work and in many respects satisfying
mrs pontellier evidently did not think so
after surveying the sketch critically she drew a broad smudge of paint across its surface and crumpled the paper between her hands
the youngsters came tumbling up the steps the quadroon following at the respectful distance which they required her to observe
mrs pontellier made them carry her paints and things into the house
she sought to detain them for a little talk and some pleasantry
but they were greatly in earnest
they had only come to investigate the contents of the bonbon box
they accepted without murmuring what she chose to give them each holding out two chubby hands scooplike in the vain hope that they might be filled and then away they went
the sun was low in the west and the breeze soft and languorous that came up from the south charged with the seductive odor of the sea
children freshly befurbelowed were gathering for their games under the oaks
their voices were high and penetrating
madame ratignolle folded her sewing placing thimble scissors and thread all neatly together in the roll which she pinned securely
she complained of faintness
mrs pontellier flew for the cologne water and a fan
she bathed madame ratignolle's face with cologne while robert plied the fan with unnecessary vigor
the spell was soon over and mrs pontellier could not help wondering if there were not a little imagination responsible for its origin for the rose tint had never faded from her friend's face
she stood watching the fair woman walk down the long line of galleries with the grace and majesty which queens are sometimes supposed to possess
her little ones ran to meet her
two of them clung about her white skirts the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand endearments bore it along in her own fond encircling arms
though as everybody well knew the doctor had forbidden her to lift so much as a pin
are you going bathing asked robert of mrs pontellier
it was not so much a question as a reminder
oh no she answered with a tone of indecision
i'm tired i think not her glance wandered from his face away toward the gulf whose sonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty
oh come he insisted
you mustn't miss your bath
come on
the water must be delicious it will not hurt you
come  he reached up for her big rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside the door and put it on her head
they descended the steps and walked away together toward the beach
the sun was low in the west and the breeze was soft and warm
vi   edna pontellier could not have told why wishing to go to the beach with robert she should in the first place have declined and in the second place have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory impulses which impelled her
a certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within herthe light which showing the way forbids it
at that early period it served but to bewilder her
it moved her to dreams to thoughtfulness to the shadowy anguish which had overcome her the midnight when she had abandoned herself to tears
in short mrs pontellier was beginning to realize her position in the universe as a human being and to recognize her relations as an individual to the world within and about her
this may seem like a ponderous weight of wisdom to descend upon the soul of a young woman of twentyeightperhaps more wisdom than the holy ghost is usually pleased to vouchsafe to any woman
but the beginning of things of a world especially is necessarily vague tangled chaotic and exceedingly disturbing
how few of us ever emerge from such beginning
how many souls perish in its tumult
the voice of the sea is seductive never ceasing whispering clamoring murmuring inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of solitude to lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation
the voice of the sea speaks to the soul
the touch of the sea is sensuous enfolding the body in its soft close embrace
vii   mrs pontellier was not a woman given to confidences a characteristic hitherto contrary to her nature
even as a child she had lived her own small life all within herself
at a very early period she had apprehended instinctively the dual lifethat outward existence which conforms the inward life which questions
that summer at grand isle she began to loosen a little the mantle of reserve that had always enveloped her
there may have beenthere must have beeninfluences both subtle and apparent working in their several ways to induce her to do this but the most obvious was the influence of adele ratignolle
the excessive physical charm of the creole had first attracted her for edna had a sensuous susceptibility to beauty
then the candor of the woman's whole existence which every one might read and which formed so striking a contrast to her own habitual reservethis might have furnished a link
who can tell what metals the gods use in forging the subtle bond which we call sympathy which we might as well call love
the two women went away one morning to the beach together arm in arm under the huge white sunshade
edna had prevailed upon madame ratignolle to leave the children behind though she could not induce her to relinquish a diminutive roll of needlework which adele begged to be allowed to slip into the depths of her pocket
in some unaccountable way they had escaped from robert
the walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one consisting as it did of a long sandy path upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads
there were acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand
further away still vegetable gardens abounded with frequent small plantations of orange or lemon trees intervening
the dark green clusters glistened from afar in the sun
the women were both of goodly height madame ratignolle possessing the more feminine and matronly figure
the charm of edna pontellier's physique stole insensibly upon you
the lines of her body were long clean and symmetrical it was a body which occasionally fell into splendid poses there was no suggestion of the trim stereotyped fashionplate about it
a casual and indiscriminating observer in passing might not cast a second glance upon the figure
but with more feeling and discernment he would have recognized the noble beauty of its modeling and the graceful severity of poise and movement which made edna pontellier different from the crowd
she wore a cool muslin that morningwhite with a waving vertical line of brown running through it also a white linen collar and the big straw hat which she had taken from the peg outside the door
the hat rested any way on her yellowbrown hair that waved a little was heavy and clung close to her head
madame ratignolle more careful of her complexion had twined a gauze veil about her head
she wore dogskin gloves with gauntlets that protected her wrists
she was dressed in pure white with a fluffiness of ruffles that became her
the draperies and fluttering things which she wore suited her rich luxuriant beauty as a greater severity of line could not have done
there were a number of bathhouses along the beach of rough but solid construction built with small protecting galleries facing the water
each house consisted of two compartments and each family at lebrun's possessed a compartment for itself fitted out with all the essential paraphernalia of the bath and whatever other conveniences the owners might desire
the two women had no intention of bathing they had just strolled down to the beach for a walk and to be alone and near the water
the pontellier and ratignolle compartments adjoined one another under the same roof
mrs pontellier had brought down her key through force of habit
unlocking the door of her bathroom she went inside and soon emerged bringing a rug which she spread upon the floor of the gallery and two huge hair pillows covered with crash which she placed against the front of the building
the two seated themselves there in the shade of the porch side by side with their backs against the pillows and their feet extended
madame ratignolle removed her veil wiped her face with a rather delicate handkerchief and fanned herself with the fan which she always carried suspended somewhere about her person by a long narrow ribbon
edna removed her collar and opened her dress at the throat
she took the fan from madame ratignolle and began to fan both herself and her companion
it was very warm and for a while they did nothing but exchange remarks about the heat the sun the glare
but there was a breeze blowing a choppy stiff wind that whipped the water into froth
it fluttered the skirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting readjusting tucking in securing hairpins and hatpins
a few persons were sporting some distance away in the water
the beach was very still of human sound at that hour
the lady in black was reading her morning devotions on the porch of a neighboring bathhouse
two young lovers were exchanging their hearts' yearnings beneath the children's tent which they had found unoccupied
edna pontellier casting her eyes about had finally kept them at rest upon the sea
the day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the blue sky went there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the horizon
a lateen sail was visible in the direction of cat island and others to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance
of whomof what are you thinking asked adele of her companion whose countenance she had been watching with a little amused attention arrested by the absorbed expression which seemed to have seized and fixed every feature into a statuesque repose
nothing returned mrs pontellier with a start adding at once how stupid
but it seems to me it is the reply we make instinctively to such a question
let me see she went on throwing back her head and narrowing her fine eyes till they shone like two vivid points of light
let me see
i was really not conscious of thinking of anything but perhaps i can retrace my thoughts  oh
never mind laughed madame ratignolle
i am not quite so exacting
i will let you off this time
it is really too hot to think especially to think about thinking  but for the fun of it persisted edna
first of all the sight of the water stretching so far away those motionless sails against the blue sky made a delicious picture that i just wanted to sit and look at
the hot wind beating in my face made me thinkwithout any connection that i can trace of a summer day in kentucky of a meadow that seemed as big as the ocean to the very little girl walking through the grass which was higher than her waist
she threw out her arms as if swimming when she walked beating the tall grass as one strikes out in the water
oh i see the connection now  where were you going that day in kentucky walking through the grass  i don't remember now
i was just walking diagonally across a big field
my sunbonnet obstructed the view
i could see only the stretch of green before me and i felt as if i must walk on forever without coming to the end of it
i don't remember whether i was frightened or pleased
i must have been entertained
likely as not it was sunday she laughed and i was running away from prayers from the presbyterian service read in a spirit of gloom by my father that chills me yet to think of  and have you been running away from prayers ever since ma chere  asked madame ratignolle amused
no
oh no edna hastened to say
i was a little unthinking child in those days just following a misleading impulse without question
on the contrary during one period of my life religion took a firm hold upon me after i was twelve and untiluntilwhy i suppose until now though i never thought much about itjust driven along by habit
but do you know she broke off turning her quick eyes upon madame ratignolle and leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to that of her companion sometimes i feel this summer as if i were walking through the green meadow again idly aimlessly unthinking and unguided  madame ratignolle laid her hand over that of mrs pontellier which was near her
seeing that the hand was not withdrawn she clasped it firmly and warmly
she even stroked it a little fondly with the other hand murmuring in an undertone pauvre cherie  the action was at first a little confusing to edna but she soon lent herself readily to the creole's gentle caress
she was not accustomed to an outward and spoken expression of affection either in herself or in others
she and her younger sister janet had quarreled a good deal through force of unfortunate habit
her older sister margaret was matronly and dignified probably from having assumed matronly and housewifely responsibilities too early in life their mother having died when they were quite young margaret was not effusive she was practical
edna had had an occasional girl friend but whether accidentally or not they seemed to have been all of one typethe selfcontained
she never realized that the reserve of her own character had much perhaps everything to do with this
her most intimate friend at school had been one of rather exceptional intellectual gifts who wrote finesounding essays which edna admired and strove to imitate and with her she talked and glowed over the english classics and sometimes held religious and political controversies
edna often wondered at one propensity which sometimes had inwardly disturbed her without causing any outward show or manifestation on her part
at a very early ageperhaps it was when she traversed the ocean of waving grassshe remembered that she had been passionately enamored of a dignified and sadeyed cavalry officer who visited her father in kentucky
she could not leave his presence when he was there nor remove her eyes from his face which was something like napoleon's with a lock of black hair failing across the forehead
but the cavalry officer melted imperceptibly out of her existence
at another time her affections were deeply engaged by a young gentleman who visited a lady on a neighboring plantation
it was after they went to mississippi to live
the young man was engaged to be married to the young lady and they sometimes called upon margaret driving over of afternoons in a buggy
edna was a little miss just merging into her teens and the realization that she herself was nothing nothing nothing to the engaged young man was a bitter affliction to her
but he too went the way of dreams
she was a grown young woman when she was overtaken by what she supposed to be the climax of her fate
it was when the face and figure of a great tragedian began to haunt her imagination and stir her senses
the persistence of the infatuation lent it an aspect of genuineness
the hopelessness of it colored it with the lofty tones of a great passion
the picture of the tragedian stood enframed upon her desk
any one may possess the portrait of a tragedian without exciting suspicion or comment
this was a sinister reflection which she cherished
in the presence of others she expressed admiration for his exalted gifts as she handed the photograph around and dwelt upon the fidelity of the likeness
when alone she sometimes picked it up and kissed the cold glass passionately
her marriage to leonce pontellier was purely an accident in this respect resembling many other marriages which masquerade as the decrees of fate
it was in the midst of her secret great passion that she met him
he fell in love as men are in the habit of doing and pressed his suit with an earnestness and an ardor which left nothing to be desired
he pleased her his absolute devotion flattered her
she fancied there was a sympathy of thought and taste between them in which fancy she was mistaken
add to this the violent opposition of her father and her sister margaret to her marriage with a catholic and we need seek no further for the motives which led her to accept monsieur pontellier for her husband
the acme of bliss which would have been a marriage with the tragedian was not for her in this world
as the devoted wife of a man who worshiped her she felt she would take her place with a certain dignity in the world of reality closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance and dreams
but it was not long before the tragedian had gone to join the cavalry officer and the engaged young man and a few others and edna found herself face to face with the realities
she grew fond of her husband realizing with some unaccountable satisfaction that no trace of passion or excessive and fictitious warmth colored her affection thereby threatening its dissolution
she was fond of her children in an uneven impulsive way
she would sometimes gather them passionately to her heart she would sometimes forget them
the year before they had spent part of the summer with their grandmother pontellier in iberville
feeling secure regarding their happiness and welfare she did not miss them except with an occasional intense longing
their absence was a sort of relief though she did not admit this even to herself
it seemed to free her of a responsibility which she had blindly assumed and for which fate had not fitted her
edna did not reveal so much as all this to madame ratignolle that summer day when they sat with faces turned to the sea
but a good part of it escaped her
she had put her head down on madame ratignolle's shoulder
she was flushed and felt intoxicated with the sound of her own voice and the unaccustomed taste of candor
it muddled her like wine or like a first breath of freedom
there was the sound of approaching voices
it was robert surrounded by a troop of children searching for them
the two little pontelliers were with him and he carried madame ratignolle's little girl in his arms
there were other children beside and two nursemaids followed looking disagreeable and resigned
the women at once rose and began to shake out their draperies and relax their muscles
mrs pontellier threw the cushions and rug into the bathhouse
the children all scampered off to the awning and they stood there in a line gazing upon the intruding lovers still exchanging their vows and sighs
the lovers got up with only a silent protest and walked slowly away somewhere else
the children possessed themselves of the tent and mrs pontellier went over to join them
madame ratignolle begged robert to accompany her to the house she complained of cramp in her limbs and stiffness of the joints
she leaned draggingly upon his arm as they walked
viii   do me a favor robert spoke the pretty woman at his side almost as soon as she and robert had started their slow homeward way
she looked up in his face leaning on his arm beneath the encircling shadow of the umbrella which he had lifted
granted as many as you like he returned glancing down into her eyes that were full of thoughtfulness and some speculation
i only ask for one let mrs pontellier alone  tiens he exclaimed with a sudden boyish laugh
voila que madame ratignolle est jalouse  nonsense
i'm in earnest i mean what i say
let mrs pontellier alone  why he asked himself growing serious at his companion's solicitation
she is not one of us she is not like us
she might make the unfortunate blunder of taking you seriously  his face flushed with annoyance and taking off his soft hat he began to beat it impatiently against his leg as he walked
why shouldn't she take me seriously he demanded sharply
am i a comedian a clown a jackinthebox
why shouldn't she
you creoles
i have no patience with you
am i always to be regarded as a feature of an amusing programme
i hope mrs pontellier does take me seriously
i hope she has discernment enough to find in me something besides the blagueur
if i thought there was any doubt  oh enough robert she broke into his heated outburst
you are not thinking of what you are saying
you speak with about as little reflection as we might expect from one of those children down there playing in the sand
if your attentions to any married women here were ever offered with any intention of being convincing you would not be the gentleman we all know you to be and you would be unfit to associate with the wives and daughters of the people who trust you  madame ratignolle had spoken what she believed to be the law and the gospel
the young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently
oh
well
that isn't it slamming his hat down vehemently upon his head
you ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to a fellow  should our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments
ma foi  it isn't pleasant to have a woman tell you he went on unheedingly but breaking off suddenly now if i were like arobinyou remember alcee arobin and that story of the consul's wife at biloxi and he related the story of alcee arobin and the consul's wife and another about the tenor of the french opera who received letters which should never have been written and still other stories grave and gay till mrs pontellier and her possible propensity for taking young men seriously was apparently forgotten
madame ratignolle when they had regained her cottage went in to take the hour's rest which she considered helpful
before leaving her robert begged her pardon for the impatiencehe called it rudenesswith which he had received her wellmeant caution
you made one mistake adele he said with a light smile there is no earthly possibility of mrs pontellier ever taking me seriously
you should have warned me against taking myself seriously
your advice might then have carried some weight and given me subject for some reflection
au revoir
but you look tired he added solicitously
would you like a cup of bouillon
shall i stir you a toddy
let me mix you a toddy with a drop of angostura  she acceded to the suggestion of bouillon which was grateful and acceptable
he went himself to the kitchen which was a building apart from the cottages and lying to the rear of the house
and he himself brought her the goldenbrown bouillon in a dainty sevres cup with a flaky cracker or two on the saucer
she thrust a bare white arm from the curtain which shielded her open door and received the cup from his hands
she told him he was a bon garcon and she meant it
robert thanked her and turned away toward the house  the lovers were just entering the grounds of the pension
they were leaning toward each other as the wateroaks bent from the sea
there was not a particle of earth beneath their feet
their heads might have been turned upsidedown so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether
the lady in black creeping behind them looked a trifle paler and more jaded than usual
there was no sign of mrs pontellier and the children
robert scanned the distance for any such apparition
they would doubtless remain away till the dinner hour
the young man ascended to his mother's room
it was situated at the top of the house made up of odd angles and a queer sloping ceiling
two broad dormer windows looked out toward the gulf and as far across it as a man's eye might reach
the furnishings of the room were light cool and practical
madame lebrun was busily engaged at the sewingmachine
a little black girl sat on the floor and with her hands worked the treadle of the machine
the creole woman does not take any chances which may be avoided of imperiling her health
robert went over and seated himself on the broad sill of one of the dormer windows
he took a book from his pocket and began energetically to read it judging by the precision and frequency with which he turned the leaves
the sewingmachine made a resounding clatter in the room it was of a ponderous bygone make
in the lulls robert and his mother exchanged bits of desultory conversation
where is mrs pontellier  down at the beach with the children  i promised to lend her the goncourt
don't forget to take it down when you go it's there on the bookshelf over the small table clatter clatter clatter bang
for the next five or eight minutes
where is victor going with the rockaway  the rockaway
victor  yes down there in front
he seems to be getting ready to drive away somewhere  call him clatter clatter
robert uttered a shrill piercing whistle which might have been heard back at the wharf
he won't look up  madame lebrun flew to the window
she called victor she waved a handkerchief and called again
the young fellow below got into the vehicle and started the horse off at a gallop
madame lebrun went back to the machine crimson with annoyance
victor was the younger son and brothera tete montee with a temper which invited violence and a will which no ax could break
whenever you say the word i'm ready to thrash any amount of reason into him that he's able to hold  if your father had only lived clatter clatter clatter clatter bang
it was a fixed belief with madame lebrun that the conduct of the universe and all things pertaining thereto would have been manifestly of a more intelligent and higher order had not monsieur lebrun been removed to other spheres during the early years of their married life
what do you hear from montel montel was a middleaged gentleman whose vain ambition and desire for the past twenty years had been to fill the void which monsieur lebrun's taking off had left in the lebrun household
clatter clatter bang clatter
i have a letter somewhere looking in the machine drawer and finding the letter in the bottom of the workbasket
he says to tell you he will be in vera cruz the beginning of next monthclatter clatterand if you still have the intention of joining himbang
clatter clatter bang
why didn't you tell me so before mother
you know i wanted clatter clatter clatter
do you see mrs pontellier starting back with the children
she will be in late to luncheon again
she never starts to get ready for luncheon till the last minute clatter clatter
where are you going  where did you say the goncourt was     ix   every light in the hall was ablaze every lamp turned as high as it could be without smoking the chimney or threatening explosion
the lamps were fixed at intervals against the wall encircling the whole room
some one had gathered orange and lemon branches and with these fashioned graceful festoons between
the dark green of the branches stood out and glistened against the white muslin curtains which draped the windows and which puffed floated and flapped at the capricious will of a stiff breeze that swept up from the gulf
it was saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held between robert and madame ratignolle on their way from the beach
an unusual number of husbands fathers and friends had come down to stay over sunday and they were being suitably entertained by their families with the material help of madame lebrun
the dining tables had all been removed to one end of the hall and the chairs ranged about in rows and in clusters
each little family group had had its say and exchanged its domestic gossip earlier in the evening
there was now an apparent disposition to relax to widen the circle of confidences and give a more general tone to the conversation
many of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual bedtime
a small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor looking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which mr pontellier had brought down
the little pontellier boys were permitting them to do so and making their authority felt
music dancing and a recitation or two were the entertainments furnished or rather offered
but there was nothing systematic about the programme no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation
at an early hour in the evening the farival twins were prevailed upon to play the piano
they were girls of fourteen always clad in the virgin's colors blue and white having been dedicated to the blessed virgin at their baptism
they played a duet from zampa and at the earnest solicitation of every one present followed it with the overture to the poet and the peasant  allez vousen
sapristi shrieked the parrot outside the door
he was the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he was not listening to these gracious performances for the first time that summer
old monsieur farival grandfather of the twins grew indignant over the interruption and insisted upon having the bird removed and consigned to regions of darkness
victor lebrun objected and his decrees were as immutable as those of fate
the parrot fortunately offered no further interruption to the entertainment the whole venom of his nature apparently having been cherished up and hurled against the twins in that one impetuous outburst
later a young brother and sister gave recitations which every one present had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the city
a little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor
the mother played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her daughter with greedy admiration and nervous apprehension
she need have had no apprehension
the child was mistress of the situation
she had been properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk tights
her little neck and arms were bare and her hair artificially crimped stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head
her poses were full of grace and her little blackshod toes twinkled as they shot out and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were bewildering
but there was no reason why every one should not dance
madame ratignolle could not so it was she who gaily consented to play for the others
she played very well keeping excellent waltz time and infusing an expression into the strains which was indeed inspiring
she was keeping up her music on account of the children she said because she and her husband both considered it a means of brightening the home and making it attractive
almost every one danced but the twins who could not be induced to separate during the brief period when one or the other should be whirling around the room in the arms of a man
they might have danced together but they did not think of it
the children were sent to bed
some went submissively others with shrieks and protests as they were dragged away
they had been permitted to sit up till after the icecream which naturally marked the limit of human indulgence
the icecream was passed around with cakegold and silver cake arranged on platters in alternate slices it had been made and frozen during the afternoon back of the kitchen by two black women under the supervision of victor
it was pronounced a great successexcellent if it had only contained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar if it had been frozen a degree harder and if the salt might have been kept out of portions of it
victor was proud of his achievement and went about recommending it and urging every one to partake of it to excess
after mrs pontellier had danced twice with her husband once with robert and once with monsieur ratignolle who was thin and tall and swayed like a reed in the wind when he danced she went out on the gallery and seated herself on the low windowsill where she commanded a view of all that went on in the hall and could look out toward the gulf
there was a soft effulgence in the east
the moon was coming up and its mystic shimmer was casting a million lights across the distant restless water
would you like to hear mademoiselle reisz play asked robert coming out on the porch where she was
of course edna would like to hear mademoiselle reisz play but she feared it would be useless to entreat her
i'll ask her he said
i'll tell her that you want to hear her
she likes you
she will come he turned and hurried away to one of the far cottages where mademoiselle reisz was shuffling away
she was dragging a chair in and out of her room and at intervals objecting to the crying of a baby which a nurse in the adjoining cottage was endeavoring to put to sleep
she was a disagreeable little woman no longer young who had quarreled with almost every one owing to a temper which was selfassertive and a disposition to trample upon the rights of others
robert prevailed upon her without any too great difficulty
she entered the hall with him during a lull in the dance
she made an awkward imperious little bow as she went in
she was a homely woman with a small weazened face and body and eyes that glowed
she had absolutely no taste in dress and wore a batch of rusty black lace with a bunch of artificial violets pinned to the side of her hair
ask mrs pontellier what she would like to hear me play she requested of robert
she sat perfectly still before the piano not touching the keys while robert carried her message to edna at the window
a general air of surprise and genuine satisfaction fell upon every one as they saw the pianist enter
there was a settling down and a prevailing air of expectancy everywhere
edna was a trifle embarrassed at being thus signaled out for the imperious little woman's favor
she would not dare to choose and begged that mademoiselle reisz would please herself in her selections
edna was what she herself called very fond of music
musical strains well rendered had a way of evoking pictures in her mind
she sometimes liked to sit in the room of mornings when madame ratignolle played or practiced
one piece which that lady played edna had entitled solitude it was a short plaintive minor strain
the name of the piece was something else but she called it solitude when she heard it there came before her imagination the figure of a man standing beside a desolate rock on the seashore
he was naked
his attitude was one of hopeless resignation as he looked toward a distant bird winging its flight away from him
another piece called to her mind a dainty young woman clad in an empire gown taking mincing dancing steps as she came down a long avenue between tall hedges
again another reminded her of children at play and still another of nothing on earth but a demure lady stroking a cat
the very first chords which mademoiselle reisz struck upon the piano sent a keen tremor down mrs pontellier's spinal column
it was not the first time she had heard an artist at the piano
perhaps it was the first time she was ready perhaps the first time her being was tempered to take an impress of the abiding truth
she waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and blaze before her imagination
she waited in vain
she saw no pictures of solitude of hope of longing or of despair
but the very passions themselves were aroused within her soul swaying it lashing it as the waves daily beat upon her splendid body
she trembled she was choking and the tears blinded her
mademoiselle had finished
she arose and bowing her stiff lofty bow she went away stopping for neither thanks nor applause
as she passed along the gallery she patted edna upon the shoulder
well how did you like my music she asked
the young woman was unable to answer she pressed the hand of the pianist convulsively
mademoiselle reisz perceived her agitation and even her tears
she patted her again upon the shoulder as she said  you are the only one worth playing for
those others
bah and she went shuffling and sidling on down the gallery toward her room
but she was mistaken about those others her playing had aroused a fever of enthusiasm
what passion what an artist i have always said no one could play chopin like mademoiselle reisz that last prelude
bon dieu
it shakes a man  it was growing late and there was a general disposition to disband
but some one perhaps it was robert thought of a bath at that mystic hour and under that mystic moon
x   at all events robert proposed it and there was not a dissenting voice
there was not one but was ready to follow when he led the way
he did not lead the way however he directed the way and he himself loitered behind with the lovers who had betrayed a disposition to linger and hold themselves apart
he walked between them whether with malicious or mischievous intent was not wholly clear even to himself
the pontelliers and ratignolles walked ahead the women leaning upon the arms of their husbands
edna could hear robert's voice behind them and could sometimes hear what he said
she wondered why he did not join them
it was unlike him not to
of late he had sometimes held away from her for an entire day redoubling his devotion upon the next and the next as though to make up for hours that had been lost
she missed him the days when some pretext served to take him away from her just as one misses the sun on a cloudy day without having thought much about the sun when it was shining
the people walked in little groups toward the beach
they talked and laughed some of them sang
there was a band playing down at klein's hotel and the strains reached them faintly tempered by the distance
there were strange rare odors abroada tangle of the sea smell and of weeds and damp newplowed earth mingled with the heavy perfume of a field of white blossoms somewhere near
but the night sat lightly upon the sea and the land
there was no weight of darkness there were no shadows
the white light of the moon had fallen upon the world like the mystery and the softness of sleep
most of them walked into the water as though into a native element
the sea was quiet now and swelled lazily in broad billows that melted into one another and did not break except upon the beach in little foamy crests that coiled back like slow white serpents
edna had attempted all summer to learn to swim
she had received instructions from both the men and women in some instances from the children
robert had pursued a system of lessons almost daily and he was nearly at the point of discouragement in realizing the futility of his efforts
a certain ungovernable dread hung about her when in the water unless there was a hand near by that might reach out and reassure her
but that night she was like the little tottering stumbling clutching child who of a sudden realizes its powers and walks for the first time alone boldly and with overconfidence
she could have shouted for joy
she did shout for joy as with a sweeping stroke or two she lifted her body to the surface of the water
a feeling of exultation overtook her as if some power of significant import had been given her to control the working of her body and her soul
she grew daring and reckless overestimating her strength
she wanted to swim far out where no woman had swum before
her unlookedfor achievement was the subject of wonder applause and admiration
each one congratulated himself that his special teachings had accomplished this desired end
how easy it is she thought
it is nothing she said aloud why did i not discover before that it was nothing
think of the time i have lost splashing about like a baby she would not join the groups in their sports and bouts but intoxicated with her newly conquered power she swam out alone
she turned her face seaward to gather in an impression of space and solitude which the vast expanse of water meeting and melting with the moonlit sky conveyed to her excited fancy
as she swam she seemed to be reaching out for the unlimited in which to lose herself
once she turned and looked toward the shore toward the people she had left there
she had not gone any great distancethat is what would have been a great distance for an experienced swimmer
but to her unaccustomed vision the stretch of water behind her assumed the aspect of a barrier which her unaided strength would never be able to overcome
a quick vision of death smote her soul and for a second of time appalled and enfeebled her senses
but by an effort she rallied her staggering faculties and managed to regain the land
she made no mention of her encounter with death and her flash of terror except to say to her husband i thought i should have perished out there alone  you were not so very far my dear i was watching you he told her
edna went at once to the bathhouse and she had put on her dry clothes and was ready to return home before the others had left the water
she started to walk away alone
they all called to her and shouted to her
she waved a dissenting hand and went on paying no further heed to their renewed cries which sought to detain her
sometimes i am tempted to think that mrs pontellier is capricious  said madame lebrun who was amusing herself immensely and feared that edna's abrupt departure might put an end to the pleasure
i know she is assented mr pontellier sometimes not often  edna had not traversed a quarter of the distance on her way home before she was overtaken by robert
did you think i was afraid she asked him without a shade of annoyance
no i knew you weren't afraid  then why did you come
why didn't you stay out there with the others  i never thought of it  thought of what  of anything
what difference does it make  i'm very tired she uttered complainingly
i know you are  you don't know anything about it
why should you know
i never was so exhausted in my life
but it isn't unpleasant
a thousand emotions have swept through me tonight
i don't comprehend half of them
don't mind what i'm saying i am just thinking aloud
i wonder if i shall ever be stirred again as mademoiselle reisz's playing moved me tonight
i wonder if any night on earth will ever again be like this one
it is like a night in a dream
the people about me are like some uncanny halfhuman beings
there must be spirits abroad tonight  there are whispered robert didn't you know this was the twentyeighth of august  the twentyeighth of august  yes
on the twentyeighth of august at the hour of midnight and if the moon is shiningthe moon must be shininga spirit that has haunted these shores for ages rises up from the gulf
with its own penetrating vision the spirit seeks some one mortal worthy to hold him company worthy of being exalted for a few hours into realms of the semicelestials
his search has always hitherto been fruitless and he has sunk back disheartened into the sea
but tonight he found mrs pontellier
perhaps he will never wholly release her from the spell
perhaps she will never again suffer a poor unworthy earthling to walk in the shadow of her divine presence  don't banter me she said wounded at what appeared to be his flippancy
he did not mind the entreaty but the tone with its delicate note of pathos was like a reproach
he could not explain he could not tell her that he had penetrated her mood and understood
he said nothing except to offer her his arm for by her own admission she was exhausted
she had been walking alone with her arms hanging limp letting her white skirts trail along the dewy path
she took his arm but she did not lean upon it
she let her hand lie listlessly as though her thoughts were elsewheresomewhere in advance of her body and she was striving to overtake them
robert assisted her into the hammock which swung from the post before her door out to the trunk of a tree
will you stay out here and wait for mr pontellier he asked
i'll stay out here
goodnight  shall i get you a pillow  there's one here she said feeling about for they were in the shadow
it must be soiled the children have been tumbling it about  no matter and having discovered the pillow she adjusted it beneath her head
she extended herself in the hammock with a deep breath of relief
she was not a supercilious or an overdainty woman
she was not much given to reclining in the hammock and when she did so it was with no catlike suggestion of voluptuous ease but with a beneficent repose which seemed to invade her whole body
shall i stay with you till mr pontellier comes asked robert seating himself on the outer edge of one of the steps and taking hold of the hammock rope which was fastened to the post
if you wish
don't swing the hammock
will you get my white shawl which i left on the windowsill over at the house  are you chilly  no but i shall be presently  presently he laughed
do you know what time it is
how long are you going to stay out here  i don't know
will you get the shawl  of course i will he said rising
he went over to the house walking along the grass
she watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of moonlight
it was past midnight
it was very quiet
when he returned with the shawl she took it and kept it in her hand
she did not put it around her
did you say i should stay till mr pontellier came back  i said you might if you wished to  he seated himself again and rolled a cigarette which he smoked in silence
neither did mrs pontellier speak
no multitude of words could have been more significant than those moments of silence or more pregnant with the firstfelt throbbings of desire
when the voices of the bathers were heard approaching robert said goodnight
she did not answer him
he thought she was asleep
again she watched his figure pass in and out of the strips of moonlight as he walked away
xi   what are you doing out here edna
i thought i should find you in bed  said her husband when he discovered her lying there
he had walked up with madame lebrun and left her at the house
his wife did not reply
are you asleep he asked bending down close to look at her
no her eyes gleamed bright and intense with no sleepy shadows as they looked into his
do you know it is past one o'clock
come on and he mounted the steps and went into their room
edna called mr pontellier from within after a few moments had gone by
don't wait for me she answered
he thrust his head through the door
you will take cold out there he said irritably
what folly is this
why don't you come in  it isn't cold i have my shawl  the mosquitoes will devour you  there are no mosquitoes  she heard him moving about the room every sound indicating impatience and irritation
another time she would have gone in at his request
she would through habit have yielded to his desire not with any sense of submission or obedience to his compelling wishes but unthinkingly as we walk move sit stand go through the daily treadmill of the life which has been portioned out to us
edna dear are you not coming in soon he asked again this time fondly with a note of entreaty
no i am going to stay out here  this is more than folly he blurted out
i can't permit you to stay out there all night
you must come in the house instantly  with a writhing motion she settled herself more securely in the hammock
she perceived that her will had blazed up stubborn and resistant
she could not at that moment have done other than denied and resisted
she wondered if her husband had ever spoken to her like that before and if she had submitted to his command
of course she had she remembered that she had
but she could not realize why or how she should have yielded feeling as she then did
leonce go to bed she said i mean to stay out here
i don't wish to go in and i don't intend to
don't speak to me like that again i shall not answer you  mr pontellier had prepared for bed but he slipped on an extra garment
he opened a bottle of wine of which he kept a small and select supply in a buffet of his own
he drank a glass of the wine and went out on the gallery and offered a glass to his wife
she did not wish any
he drew up the rocker hoisted his slippered feet on the rail and proceeded to smoke a cigar
he smoked two cigars then he went inside and drank another glass of wine
mrs pontellier again declined to accept a glass when it was offered to her
mr pontellier once more seated himself with elevated feet and after a reasonable interval of time smoked some more cigars
edna began to feel like one who awakens gradually out of a dream a delicious grotesque impossible dream to feel again the realities pressing into her soul
the physical need for sleep began to overtake her the exuberance which had sustained and exalted her spirit left her helpless and yielding to the conditions which crowded her in
the stillest hour of the night had come the hour before dawn when the world seems to hold its breath
the moon hung low and had turned from silver to copper in the sleeping sky
the old owl no longer hooted and the wateroaks had ceased to moan as they bent their heads
edna arose cramped from lying so long and still in the hammock
she tottered up the steps clutching feebly at the post before passing into the house
are you coming in leonce she asked turning her face toward her husband
yes dear he answered with a glance following a misty puff of smoke
just as soon as i have finished my cigar     xii   she slept but a few hours
they were troubled and feverish hours disturbed with dreams that were intangible that eluded her leaving only an impression upon her halfawakened senses of something unattainable
she was up and dressed in the cool of the early morning
the air was invigorating and steadied somewhat her faculties
however she was not seeking refreshment or help from any source either external or from within
she was blindly following whatever impulse moved her as if she had placed herself in alien hands for direction and freed her soul of responsibility
most of the people at that early hour were still in bed and asleep
a few who intended to go over to the cheniere for mass were moving about
the lovers who had laid their plans the night before were already strolling toward the wharf
the lady in black with her sunday prayerbook velvet and goldclasped and her sunday silver beads was following them at no great distance
old monsieur farival was up and was more than half inclined to do anything that suggested itself
he put on his big straw hat and taking his umbrella from the stand in the hall followed the lady in black never overtaking her
the little negro girl who worked madame lebrun's sewingmachine was sweeping the galleries with long absentminded strokes of the broom
edna sent her up into the house to awaken robert
tell him i am going to the cheniere
the boat is ready tell him to hurry  he had soon joined her
she had never sent for him before
she had never asked for him
she had never seemed to want him before
she did not appear conscious that she had done anything unusual in commanding his presence
he was apparently equally unconscious of anything extraordinary in the situation
but his face was suffused with a quiet glow when he met her
they went together back to the kitchen to drink coffee
there was no time to wait for any nicety of service
they stood outside the window and the cook passed them their coffee and a roll which they drank and ate from the windowsill
edna said it tasted good
she had not thought of coffee nor of anything
he told her he had often noticed that she lacked forethought
wasn't it enough to think of going to the cheniere and waking you up  she laughed
do i have to think of everythingas leonce says when he's in a bad humor
i don't blame him he'd never be in a bad humor if it weren't for me  they took a short cut across the sands
at a distance they could see the curious procession moving toward the wharfthe lovers shoulder to shoulder creeping the lady in black gaining steadily upon them old monsieur farival losing ground inch by inch and a young barefooted spanish girl with a red kerchief on her head and a basket on her arm bringing up the rear
robert knew the girl and he talked to her a little in the boat
no one present understood what they said
her name was mariequita
she had a round sly piquant face and pretty black eyes
her hands were small and she kept them folded over the handle of her basket
her feet were broad and coarse
she did not strive to hide them
edna looked at her feet and noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes
beaudelet grumbled because mariequita was there taking up so much room
in reality he was annoyed at having old monsieur farival who considered himself the better sailor of the two
but he would not quarrel with so old a man as monsieur farival so he quarreled with mariequita
the girl was deprecatory at one moment appealing to robert
she was saucy the next moving her head up and down making eyes at robert and making mouths at beaudelet
the lovers were all alone
they saw nothing they heard nothing
the lady in black was counting her beads for the third time
old monsieur farival talked incessantly of what he knew about handling a boat and of what beaudelet did not know on the same subject
edna liked it all
she looked mariequita up and down from her ugly brown toes to her pretty black eyes and back again
why does she look at me like that inquired the girl of robert
maybe she thinks you are pretty
shall i ask her  no
is she your sweetheart  she's a married lady and has two children  oh
well
francisco ran away with sylvano's wife who had four children
they took all his money and one of the children and stole his boat  shut up  does she understand  oh hush  are those two married over thereleaning on each other  of course not laughed robert
of course not echoed mariequita with a serious confirmatory bob of the head
the sun was high up and beginning to bite
the swift breeze seemed to edna to bury the sting of it into the pores of her face and hands
robert held his umbrella over her
as they went cutting sidewise through the water the sails bellied taut with the wind filling and overflowing them
old monsieur farival laughed sardonically at something as he looked at the sails and beaudelet swore at the old man under his breath
sailing across the bay to the cheniere caminada edna felt as if she were being borne away from some anchorage which had held her fast whose chains had been looseninghad snapped the night before when the mystic spirit was abroad leaving her free to drift whithersoever she chose to set her sails
robert spoke to her incessantly he no longer noticed mariequita
the girl had shrimps in her bamboo basket
they were covered with spanish moss
she beat the moss down impatiently and muttered to herself sullenly
let us go to grande terre tomorrow said robert in a low voice
what shall we do there  climb up the hill to the old fort and look at the little wriggling gold snakes and watch the lizards sun themselves  she gazed away toward grande terre and thought she would like to be alone there with robert in the sun listening to the ocean's roar and watching the slimy lizards writhe in and out among the ruins of the old fort
and the next day or the next we can sail to the bayou brulow he went on
what shall we do there  anythingcast bait for fish  no we'll go back to grande terre
let the fish alone  we'll go wherever you like he said
i'll have tonie come over and help me patch and trim my boat
we shall not need beaudelet nor any one
are you afraid of the pirogue  oh no  then i'll take you some night in the pirogue when the moon shines
maybe your gulf spirit will whisper to you in which of these islands the treasures are hiddendirect you to the very spot perhaps  and in a day we should be rich she laughed
i'd give it all to you the pirate gold and every bit of treasure we could dig up
i think you would know how to spend it
pirate gold isn't a thing to be hoarded or utilized
it is something to squander and throw to the four winds for the fun of seeing the golden specks fly  we'd share it and scatter it together he said
his face flushed
they all went together up to the quaint little gothic church of our lady of lourdes gleaming all brown and yellow with paint in the sun's glare
only beaudelet remained behind tinkering at his boat and mariequita walked away with her basket of shrimps casting a look of childish ill humor and reproach at robert from the corner of her eye
xiii   a feeling of oppression and drowsiness overcame edna during the service
her head began to ache and the lights on the altar swayed before her eyes
another time she might have made an effort to regain her composure but her one thought was to quit the stifling atmosphere of the church and reach the open air
she arose climbing over robert's feet with a muttered apology
old monsieur farival flurried curious stood up but upon seeing that robert had followed mrs pontellier he sank back into his seat
he whispered an anxious inquiry of the lady in black who did not notice him or reply but kept her eyes fastened upon the pages of her velvet prayerbook
i felt giddy and almost overcome edna said lifting her hands instinctively to her head and pushing her straw hat up from her forehead
i couldn't have stayed through the service they were outside in the shadow of the church
robert was full of solicitude
it was folly to have thought of going in the first place let alone staying
come over to madame antoine's you can rest there he took her arm and led her away looking anxiously and continuously down into her face
how still it was with only the voice of the sea whispering through the reeds that grew in the saltwater pools
the long line of little gray weatherbeaten houses nestled peacefully among the orange trees
it must always have been god's day on that low drowsy island edna thought
they stopped leaning over a jagged fence made of seadrift to ask for water
a youth a mildfaced acadian was drawing water from the cistern which was nothing more than a rusty buoy with an opening on one side sunk in the ground
the water which the youth handed to them in a tin pail was not cold to taste but it was cool to her heated face and it greatly revived and refreshed her
madame antoine's cot was at the far end of the village
she welcomed them with all the native hospitality as she would have opened her door to let the sunlight in
she was fat and walked heavily and clumsily across the floor
she could speak no english but when robert made her understand that the lady who accompanied him was ill and desired to rest she was all eagerness to make edna feel at home and to dispose of her comfortably
the whole place was immaculately clean and the big fourposted bed snowwhite invited one to repose
it stood in a small side room which looked out across a narrow grass plot toward the shed where there was a disabled boat lying keel upward
madame antoine had not gone to mass
her son tonie had but she supposed he would soon be back and she invited robert to be seated and wait for him
but he went and sat outside the door and smoked
madame antoine busied herself in the large front room preparing dinner
she was boiling mullets over a few red coals in the huge fireplace
edna left alone in the little side room loosened her clothes removing the greater part of them
she bathed her face her neck and arms in the basin that stood between the windows
she took off her shoes and stockings and stretched herself in the very center of the high white bed
how luxurious it felt to rest thus in a strange quaint bed with its sweet country odor of laurel lingering about the sheets and mattress
she stretched her strong limbs that ached a little
she ran her fingers through her loosened hair for a while
she looked at her round arms as she held them straight up and rubbed them one after the other observing closely as if it were something she saw for the first time the fine firm quality and texture of her flesh
she clasped her hands easily above her head and it was thus she fell asleep
she slept lightly at first half awake and drowsily attentive to the things about her
she could hear madame antoine's heavy scraping tread as she walked back and forth on the sanded floor
some chickens were clucking outside the windows scratching for bits of gravel in the grass
later she half heard the voices of robert and tonie talking under the shed
she did not stir
even her eyelids rested numb and heavily over her sleepy eyes
the voices went ontonie's slow acadian drawl robert's quick soft smooth french
she understood french imperfectly unless directly addressed and the voices were only part of the other drowsy muffled sounds lulling her senses
when edna awoke it was with the conviction that she had slept long and soundly
the voices were hushed under the shed
madame antoine's step was no longer to be heard in the adjoining room
even the chickens had gone elsewhere to scratch and cluck
the mosquito bar was drawn over her the old woman had come in while she slept and let down the bar
edna arose quietly from the bed and looking between the curtains of the window she saw by the slanting rays of the sun that the afternoon was far advanced
robert was out there under the shed reclining in the shade against the sloping keel of the overturned boat
he was reading from a book
tonie was no longer with him
she wondered what had become of the rest of the party
she peeped out at him two or three times as she stood washing herself in the little basin between the windows
madame antoine had laid some coarse clean towels upon a chair and had placed a box of poudre de riz within easy reach
edna dabbed the powder upon her nose and cheeks as she looked at herself closely in the little distorted mirror which hung on the wall above the basin
her eyes were bright and wide awake and her face glowed
when she had completed her toilet she walked into the adjoining room
she was very hungry
no one was there
but there was a cloth spread upon the table that stood against the wall and a cover was laid for one with a crusty brown loaf and a bottle of wine beside the plate
edna bit a piece from the brown loaf tearing it with her strong white teeth
she poured some of the wine into the glass and drank it down
then she went softly out of doors and plucking an orange from the lowhanging bough of a tree threw it at robert who did not know she was awake and up
an illumination broke over his whole face when he saw her and joined her under the orange tree
how many years have i slept she inquired
the whole island seems changed
a new race of beings must have sprung up leaving only you and me as past relics
how many ages ago did madame antoine and tonie die
and when did our people from grand isle disappear from the earth  he familiarly adjusted a ruffle upon her shoulder
you have slept precisely one hundred years
i was left here to guard your slumbers and for one hundred years i have been out under the shed reading a book
the only evil i couldn't prevent was to keep a broiled fowl from drying up  if it has turned to stone still will i eat it said edna moving with him into the house
but really what has become of monsieur farival and the others  gone hours ago
when they found that you were sleeping they thought it best not to awake you
any way i wouldn't have let them
what was i here for  i wonder if leonce will be uneasy she speculated as she seated herself at table
of course not he knows you are with me robert replied as he busied himself among sundry pans and covered dishes which had been left standing on the hearth
where are madame antoine and her son asked edna
gone to vespers and to visit some friends i believe
i am to take you back in tonie's boat whenever you are ready to go  he stirred the smoldering ashes till the broiled fowl began to sizzle afresh
he served her with no mean repast dripping the coffee anew and sharing it with her
madame antoine had cooked little else than the mullets but while edna slept robert had foraged the island
he was childishly gratified to discover her appetite and to see the relish with which she ate the food which he had procured for her
shall we go right away she asked after draining her glass and brushing together the crumbs of the crusty loaf
the sun isn't as low as it will be in two hours he answered
the sun will be gone in two hours  well let it go who cares  they waited a good while under the orange trees till madame antoine came back panting waddling with a thousand apologies to explain her absence
tonie did not dare to return
he was shy and would not willingly face any woman except his mother
it was very pleasant to stay there under the orange trees while the sun dipped lower and lower turning the western sky to flaming copper and gold
the shadows lengthened and crept out like stealthy grotesque monsters across the grass
edna and robert both sat upon the groundthat is he lay upon the ground beside her occasionally picking at the hem of her muslin gown
madame antoine seated her fat body broad and squat upon a bench beside the door
she had been talking all the afternoon and had wound herself up to the storytelling pitch
and what stories she told them
but twice in her life she had left the cheniere caminada and then for the briefest span
all her years she had squatted and waddled there upon the island gathering legends of the baratarians and the sea
the night came on with the moon to lighten it
edna could hear the whispering voices of dead men and the click of muffled gold
when she and robert stepped into tonie's boat with the red lateen sail misty spirit forms were prowling in the shadows and among the reeds and upon the water were phantom ships speeding to cover
xiv   the youngest boy etienne had been very naughty madame ratignolle said as she delivered him into the hands of his mother
he had been unwilling to go to bed and had made a scene whereupon she had taken charge of him and pacified him as well as she could
raoul had been in bed and asleep for two hours
the youngster was in his long white nightgown that kept tripping him up as madame ratignolle led him along by the hand
with the other chubby fist he rubbed his eyes which were heavy with sleep and ill humor
edna took him in her arms and seating herself in the rocker began to coddle and caress him calling him all manner of tender names soothing him to sleep
it was not more than nine o'clock
no one had yet gone to bed but the children
leonce had been very uneasy at first madame ratignolle said and had wanted to start at once for the cheniere
but monsieur farival had assured him that his wife was only overcome with sleep and fatigue that tonie would bring her safely back later in the day and he had thus been dissuaded from crossing the bay
he had gone over to klein's looking up some cotton broker whom he wished to see in regard to securities exchanges stocks bonds or something of the sort madame ratignolle did not remember what
he said he would not remain away late
she herself was suffering from heat and oppression she said
she carried a bottle of salts and a large fan
she would not consent to remain with edna for monsieur ratignolle was alone and he detested above all things to be left alone
when etienne had fallen asleep edna bore him into the back room and robert went and lifted the mosquito bar that she might lay the child comfortably in his bed
the quadroon had vanished
when they emerged from the cottage robert bade edna goodnight
do you know we have been together the whole livelong day robertsince early this morning she said at parting
all but the hundred years when you were sleeping
goodnight  he pressed her hand and went away in the direction of the beach
he did not join any of the others but walked alone toward the gulf
edna stayed outside awaiting her husband's return
she had no desire to sleep or to retire nor did she feel like going over to sit with the ratignolles or to join madame lebrun and a group whose animated voices reached her as they sat in conversation before the house
she let her mind wander back over her stay at grand isle and she tried to discover wherein this summer had been different from any and every other summer of her life
she could only realize that she herselfher present selfwas in some way different from the other self
that she was seeing with different eyes and making the acquaintance of new conditions in herself that colored and changed her environment she did not yet suspect
she wondered why robert had gone away and left her
it did not occur to her to think he might have grown tired of being with her the livelong day
she was not tired and she felt that he was not
she regretted that he had gone
it was so much more natural to have him stay when he was not absolutely required to leave her
as edna waited for her husband she sang low a little song that robert had sung as they crossed the bay
it began with ah
si tu savais and every verse ended with si tu savais  robert's voice was not pretentious
it was musical and true
the voice the notes the whole refrain haunted her memory
xv   when edna entered the diningroom one evening a little late as was her habit an unusually animated conversation seemed to be going on
several persons were talking at once and victor's voice was predominating even over that of his mother
edna had returned late from her bath had dressed in some haste and her face was flushed
her head set off by her dainty white gown suggested a rich rare blossom
she took her seat at table between old monsieur farival and madame ratignolle
as she seated herself and was about to begin to eat her soup which had been served when she entered the room several persons informed her simultaneously that robert was going to mexico
she laid her spoon down and looked about her bewildered
he had been with her reading to her all the morning and had never even mentioned such a place as mexico
she had not seen him during the afternoon she had heard some one say he was at the house upstairs with his mother
this she had thought nothing of though she was surprised when he did not join her later in the afternoon when she went down to the beach
she looked across at him where he sat beside madame lebrun who presided
edna's face was a blank picture of bewilderment which she never thought of disguising
he lifted his eyebrows with the pretext of a smile as he returned her glance
he looked embarrassed and uneasy
when is he going she asked of everybody in general as if robert were not there to answer for himself
tonight this very evening did you ever what possesses him  were some of the replies she gathered uttered simultaneously in french and english
impossible she exclaimed
how can a person start off from grand isle to mexico at a moment's notice as if he were going over to klein's or to the wharf or down to the beach  i said all along i was going to mexico i've been saying so for years  cried robert in an excited and irritable tone with the air of a man defending himself against a swarm of stinging insects
madame lebrun knocked on the table with her knife handle
please let robert explain why he is going and why he is going tonight she called out
really this table is getting to be more and more like bedlam every day with everybody talking at once
sometimesi hope god will forgive mebut positively sometimes i wish victor would lose the power of speech  victor laughed sardonically as he thanked his mother for her holy wish of which he failed to see the benefit to anybody except that it might afford her a more ample opportunity and license to talk herself
monsieur farival thought that victor should have been taken out in midocean in his earliest youth and drowned
victor thought there would be more logic in thus disposing of old people with an established claim for making themselves universally obnoxious
madame lebrun grew a trifle hysterical robert called his brother some sharp hard names
there's nothing much to explain mother he said though he explained neverthelesslooking chiefly at ednathat he could only meet the gentleman whom he intended to join at vera cruz by taking such and such a steamer which left new orleans on such a day that beaudelet was going out with his luggerload of vegetables that night which gave him an opportunity of reaching the city and making his vessel in time
but when did you make up your mind to all this demanded monsieur farival
this afternoon returned robert with a shade of annoyance
at what time this afternoon persisted the old gentleman with nagging determination as if he were crossquestioning a criminal in a court of justice
at four o'clock this afternoon monsieur farival robert replied in a high voice and with a lofty air which reminded edna of some gentleman on the stage
she had forced herself to eat most of her soup and now she was picking the flaky bits of a court bouillon with her fork
the lovers were profiting by the general conversation on mexico to speak in whispers of matters which they rightly considered were interesting to no one but themselves
the lady in black had once received a pair of prayerbeads of curious workmanship from mexico with very special indulgence attached to them but she had never been able to ascertain whether the indulgence extended outside the mexican border
father fochel of the cathedral had attempted to explain it but he had not done so to her satisfaction
and she begged that robert would interest himself and discover if possible whether she was entitled to the indulgence accompanying the remarkably curious mexican prayerbeads
madame ratignolle hoped that robert would exercise extreme caution in dealing with the mexicans who she considered were a treacherous people unscrupulous and revengeful
she trusted she did them no injustice in thus condemning them as a race
she had known personally but one mexican who made and sold excellent tamales and whom she would have trusted implicitly so softspoken was he
one day he was arrested for stabbing his wife
she never knew whether he had been hanged or not
victor had grown hilarious and was attempting to tell an anecdote about a mexican girl who served chocolate one winter in a restaurant in dauphine street
no one would listen to him but old monsieur farival who went into convulsions over the droll story
edna wondered if they had all gone mad to be talking and clamoring at that rate
she herself could think of nothing to say about mexico or the mexicans
at what time do you leave she asked robert
at ten he told her
beaudelet wants to wait for the moon  are you all ready to go  quite ready
i shall only take a handbag and shall pack my trunk in the city  he turned to answer some question put to him by his mother and edna having finished her black coffee left the table
she went directly to her room
the little cottage was close and stuffy after leaving the outer air
but she did not mind there appeared to be a hundred different things demanding her attention indoors
she began to set the toiletstand to rights grumbling at the negligence of the quadroon who was in the adjoining room putting the children to bed
she gathered together stray garments that were hanging on the backs of chairs and put each where it belonged in closet or bureau drawer
she changed her gown for a more comfortable and commodious wrapper
she rearranged her hair combing and brushing it with unusual energy
then she went in and assisted the quadroon in getting the boys to bed
they were very playful and inclined to talkto do anything but lie quiet and go to sleep
edna sent the quadroon away to her supper and told her she need not return
then she sat and told the children a story
instead of soothing it excited them and added to their wakefulness
she left them in heated argument speculating about the conclusion of the tale which their mother promised to finish the following night
the little black girl came in to say that madame lebrun would like to have mrs pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till mr robert went away
edna returned answer that she had already undressed that she did not feel quite well but perhaps she would go over to the house later
she started to dress again and got as far advanced as to remove her peignoir
but changing her mind once more she resumed the peignoir and went outside and sat down before her door
she was overheated and irritable and fanned herself energetically for a while
madame ratignolle came down to discover what was the matter
all that noise and confusion at the table must have upset me replied edna and moreover i hate shocks and surprises
the idea of robert starting off in such a ridiculously sudden and dramatic way
as if it were a matter of life and death
never saying a word about it all morning when he was with me  yes agreed madame ratignolle
i think it was showing us allyou especiallyvery little consideration
it wouldn't have surprised me in any of the others those lebruns are all given to heroics
but i must say i should never have expected such a thing from robert
are you not coming down
come on dear it doesn't look friendly  no said edna a little sullenly
i can't go to the trouble of dressing again i don't feel like it  you needn't dress you look all right fasten a belt around your waist
just look at me  no persisted edna but you go on
madame lebrun might be offended if we both stayed away  madame ratignolle kissed edna goodnight and went away being in truth rather desirous of joining in the general and animated conversation which was still in progress concerning mexico and the mexicans
somewhat later robert came up carrying his handbag
aren't you feeling well he asked
oh well enough
are you going right away  he lit a match and looked at his watch
in twenty minutes he said
the sudden and brief flare of the match emphasized the darkness for a while
he sat down upon a stool which the children had left out on the porch
get a chair said edna
this will do he replied
he put on his soft hat and nervously took it off again and wiping his face with his handkerchief complained of the heat
take the fan said edna offering it to him
oh no
thank you
it does no good you have to stop fanning some time and feel all the more uncomfortable afterward  that's one of the ridiculous things which men always say
i have never known one to speak otherwise of fanning
how long will you be gone  forever perhaps
i don't know
it depends upon a good many things  well in case it shouldn't be forever how long will it be  i don't know  this seems to me perfectly preposterous and uncalled for
i don't like it
i don't understand your motive for silence and mystery never saying a word to me about it this morning he remained silent not offering to defend himself
he only said after a moment  don't part from me in any ill humor
i never knew you to be out of patience with me before  i don't want to part in any ill humor she said
but can't you understand
i've grown used to seeing you to having you with me all the time and your action seems unfriendly even unkind
you don't even offer an excuse for it
why i was planning to be together thinking of how pleasant it would be to see you in the city next winter  so was i he blurted
perhaps that's the he stood up suddenly and held out his hand
goodby my dear mrs pontellier goodby
you won'ti hope you won't completely forget me she clung to his hand striving to detain him
write to me when you get there won't you robert she entreated
i will thank you
goodby  how unlike robert
the merest acquaintance would have said something more emphatic than i will thank you goodby to such a request
he had evidently already taken leave of the people over at the house for he descended the steps and went to join beaudelet who was out there with an oar across his shoulder waiting for robert
they walked away in the darkness
she could only hear beaudelet's voice robert had apparently not even spoken a word of greeting to his companion
edna bit her handkerchief convulsively striving to hold back and to hide even from herself as she would have hidden from another the emotion which was troublingtearingher
her eyes were brimming with tears
for the first time she recognized the symptoms of infatuation which she had felt incipiently as a child as a girl in her earliest teens and later as a young woman
the recognition did not lessen the reality the poignancy of the revelation by any suggestion or promise of instability
the past was nothing to her offered no lesson which she was willing to heed
the future was a mystery which she never attempted to penetrate
the present alone was significant was hers to torture her as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held that she had been denied that which her impassioned newly awakened being demanded
xvi   do you miss your friend greatly asked mademoiselle reisz one morning as she came creeping up behind edna who had just left her cottage on her way to the beach
she spent much of her time in the water since she had acquired finally the art of swimming
as their stay at grand isle drew near its close she felt that she could not give too much time to a diversion which afforded her the only real pleasurable moments that she knew
when mademoiselle reisz came and touched her upon the shoulder and spoke to her the woman seemed to echo the thought which was ever in edna's mind or better the feeling which constantly possessed her
robert's going had some way taken the brightness the color the meaning out of everything
the conditions of her life were in no way changed but her whole existence was dulled like a faded garment which seems to be no longer worth wearing
she sought him everywherein others whom she induced to talk about him
she went up in the mornings to madame lebrun's room braving the clatter of the old sewingmachine
she sat there and chatted at intervals as robert had done
she gazed around the room at the pictures and photographs hanging upon the wall and discovered in some corner an old family album which she examined with the keenest interest appealing to madame lebrun for enlightenment concerning the many figures and faces which she discovered between its pages
there was a picture of madame lebrun with robert as a baby seated in her lap a roundfaced infant with a fist in his mouth
the eyes alone in the baby suggested the man
and that was he also in kilts at the age of five wearing long curls and holding a whip in his hand
it made edna laugh and she laughed too at the portrait in his first long trousers while another interested her taken when he left for college looking thin longfaced with eyes full of fire ambition and great intentions
but there was no recent picture none which suggested the robert who had gone away five days ago leaving a void and wilderness behind him
oh robert stopped having his pictures taken when he had to pay for them himself
he found wiser use for his money he says explained madame lebrun
she had a letter from him written before he left new orleans
edna wished to see the letter and madame lebrun told her to look for it either on the table or the dresser or perhaps it was on the mantelpiece
the letter was on the bookshelf
it possessed the greatest interest and attraction for edna the envelope its size and shape the postmark the handwriting
she examined every detail of the outside before opening it
there were only a few lines setting forth that he would leave the city that afternoon that he had packed his trunk in good shape that he was well and sent her his love and begged to be affectionately remembered to all
there was no special message to edna except a postscript saying that if mrs pontellier desired to finish the book which he had been reading to her his mother would find it in his room among other books there on the table
edna experienced a pang of jealousy because he had written to his mother rather than to her
every one seemed to take for granted that she missed him
even her husband when he came down the saturday following robert's departure expressed regret that he had gone
how do you get on without him edna he asked
it's very dull without him she admitted
mr pontellier had seen robert in the city and edna asked him a dozen questions or more
where had they met
on carondelet street in the morning
they had gone in and had a drink and a cigar together
what had they talked about
chiefly about his prospects in mexico which mr pontellier thought were promising
how did he look
how did he seemgrave or gay or how
quite cheerful and wholly taken up with the idea of his trip which mr pontellier found altogether natural in a young fellow about to seek fortune and adventure in a strange queer country
edna tapped her foot impatiently and wondered why the children persisted in playing in the sun when they might be under the trees
she went down and led them out of the sun scolding the quadroon for not being more attentive
it did not strike her as in the least grotesque that she should be making of robert the object of conversation and leading her husband to speak of him
the sentiment which she entertained for robert in no way resembled that which she felt for her husband or had ever felt or ever expected to feel
she had all her life long been accustomed to harbor thoughts and emotions which never voiced themselves
they had never taken the form of struggles
they belonged to her and were her own and she entertained the conviction that she had a right to them and that they concerned no one but herself
edna had once told madame ratignolle that she would never sacrifice herself for her children or for any one
then had followed a rather heated argument the two women did not appear to understand each other or to be talking the same language
edna tried to appease her friend to explain
i would give up the unessential i would give my money i would give my life for my children but i wouldn't give myself
i can't make it more clear it's only something which i am beginning to comprehend which is revealing itself to me  i don't know what you would call the essential or what you mean by the unessential said madame ratignolle cheerfully but a woman who would give her life for her children could do no more than thatyour bible tells you so
i'm sure i couldn't do more than that  oh yes you could laughed edna
she was not surprised at mademoiselle reisz's question the morning that lady following her to the beach tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she did not greatly miss her young friend
oh good morning mademoiselle is it you
why of course i miss robert
are you going down to bathe  why should i go down to bathe at the very end of the season when i haven't been in the surf all summer replied the woman disagreeably
i beg your pardon offered edna in some embarrassment for she should have remembered that mademoiselle reisz's avoidance of the water had furnished a theme for much pleasantry
some among them thought it was on account of her false hair or the dread of getting the violets wet while others attributed it to the natural aversion for water sometimes believed to accompany the artistic temperament
mademoiselle offered edna some chocolates in a paper bag which she took from her pocket by way of showing that she bore no ill feeling
she habitually ate chocolates for their sustaining quality they contained much nutriment in small compass she said
they saved her from starvation as madame lebrun's table was utterly impossible and no one save so impertinent a woman as madame lebrun could think of offering such food to people and requiring them to pay for it
she must feel very lonely without her son said edna desiring to change the subject
her favorite son too
it must have been quite hard to let him go  mademoiselle laughed maliciously
her favorite son
oh dear
who could have been imposing such a tale upon you
aline lebrun lives for victor and for victor alone
she has spoiled him into the worthless creature he is
she worships him and the ground he walks on
robert is very well in a way to give up all the money he can earn to the family and keep the barest pittance for himself
favorite son indeed
i miss the poor fellow myself my dear
i liked to see him and to hear him about the place the only lebrun who is worth a pinch of salt
he comes to see me often in the city
i like to play to him
that victor
hanging would be too good for him
it's a wonder robert hasn't beaten him to death long ago  i thought he had great patience with his brother offered edna glad to be talking about robert no matter what was said
oh
he thrashed him well enough a year or two ago said mademoiselle
it was about a spanish girl whom victor considered that he had some sort of claim upon
he met robert one day talking to the girl or walking with her or bathing with her or carrying her basketi don't remember whatand he became so insulting and abusive that robert gave him a thrashing on the spot that has kept him comparatively in order for a good while
it's about time he was getting another  was her name mariequita asked edna
mariequitayes that was it mariequita
i had forgotten
oh she's a sly one and a bad one that mariequita  edna looked down at mademoiselle reisz and wondered how she could have listened to her venom so long
for some reason she felt depressed almost unhappy
she had not intended to go into the water but she donned her bathing suit and left mademoiselle alone seated under the shade of the children's tent
the water was growing cooler as the season advanced
edna plunged and swam about with an abandon that thrilled and invigorated her
she remained a long time in the water half hoping that mademoiselle reisz would not wait for her
but mademoiselle waited
she was very amiable during the walk back and raved much over edna's appearance in her bathing suit
she talked about music
she hoped that edna would go to see her in the city and wrote her address with the stub of a pencil on a piece of card which she found in her pocket
when do you leave asked edna
next monday and you  the following week answered edna adding it has been a pleasant summer hasn't it mademoiselle  well agreed mademoiselle reisz with a shrug rather pleasant if it hadn't been for the mosquitoes and the farival twins     xvii   the pontelliers possessed a very charming home on esplanade street in new orleans
it was a large double cottage with a broad front veranda whose round fluted columns supported the sloping roof
the house was painted a dazzling white the outside shutters or jalousies were green
in the yard which was kept scrupulously neat were flowers and plants of every description which flourishes in south louisiana
within doors the appointments were perfect after the conventional type
the softest carpets and rugs covered the floors rich and tasteful draperies hung at doors and windows
there were paintings selected with judgment and discrimination upon the walls
the cut glass the silver the heavy damask which daily appeared upon the table were the envy of many women whose husbands were less generous than mr pontellier
mr pontellier was very fond of walking about his house examining its various appointments and details to see that nothing was amiss
he greatly valued his possessions chiefly because they were his and derived genuine pleasure from contemplating a painting a statuette a rare lace curtainno matter whatafter he had bought it and placed it among his household gods
on tuesday afternoonstuesday being mrs pontellier's reception daythere was a constant stream of callerswomen who came in carriages or in the street cars or walked when the air was soft and distance permitted
a lightcolored mulatto boy in dress coat and bearing a diminutive silver tray for the reception of cards admitted them
a maid in white fluted cap offered the callers liqueur coffee or chocolate as they might desire
mrs pontellier attired in a handsome reception gown remained in the drawingroom the entire afternoon receiving her visitors
men sometimes called in the evening with their wives
this had been the programme which mrs pontellier had religiously followed since her marriage six years before
certain evenings during the week she and her husband attended the opera or sometimes the play
mr pontellier left his home in the mornings between nine and ten o'clock and rarely returned before halfpast six or seven in the eveningdinner being served at halfpast seven
he and his wife seated themselves at table one tuesday evening a few weeks after their return from grand isle
they were alone together
the boys were being put to bed the patter of their bare escaping feet could be heard occasionally as well as the pursuing voice of the quadroon lifted in mild protest and entreaty
mrs pontellier did not wear her usual tuesday reception gown she was in ordinary house dress
mr pontellier who was observant about such things noticed it as he served the soup and handed it to the boy in waiting
tired out edna
whom did you have
many callers he asked
he tasted his soup and began to season it with pepper salt vinegar mustardeverything within reach
there were a good many replied edna who was eating her soup with evident satisfaction
i found their cards when i got home i was out  out exclaimed her husband with something like genuine consternation in his voice as he laid down the vinegar cruet and looked at her through his glasses
why what could have taken you out on tuesday
what did you have to do  nothing
i simply felt like going out and i went out  well i hope you left some suitable excuse said her husband somewhat appeased as he added a dash of cayenne pepper to the soup
no i left no excuse
i told joe to say i was out that was all  why my dear i should think you'd understand by this time that people don't do such things we've got to observe les convenances if we ever expect to get on and keep up with the procession
if you felt that you had to leave home this afternoon you should have left some suitable explanation for your absence
this soup is really impossible it's strange that woman hasn't learned yet to make a decent soup
any freelunch stand in town serves a better one
was mrs belthrop here  bring the tray with the cards joe
i don't remember who was here  the boy retired and returned after a moment bringing the tiny silver tray which was covered with ladies' visiting cards
he handed it to mrs pontellier
give it to mr pontellier she said
joe offered the tray to mr pontellier and removed the soup
mr pontellier scanned the names of his wife's callers reading some of them aloud with comments as he read
'the misses delasidas'
i worked a big deal in futures for their father this morning nice girls it's time they were getting married
'mrs
belthrop'
i tell you what it is edna you can't afford to snub mrs belthrop
why belthrop could buy and sell us ten times over
his business is worth a good round sum to me
you'd better write her a note
'mrs
james highcamp'
hugh
the less you have to do with mrs highcamp the better
'madame laforce'
came all the way from carrolton too poor old soul
'miss wiggs' 'mrs
eleanor boltons
' he pushed the cards aside
mercy exclaimed edna who had been fuming
why are you taking the thing so seriously and making such a fuss over it  i'm not making any fuss over it
but it's just such seeming trifles that we've got to take seriously such things count  the fish was scorched
mr pontellier would not touch it
edna said she did not mind a little scorched taste
the roast was in some way not to his fancy and he did not like the manner in which the vegetables were served
it seems to me he said we spend money enough in this house to procure at least one meal a day which a man could eat and retain his selfrespect  you used to think the cook was a treasure returned edna indifferently
perhaps she was when she first came but cooks are only human
they need looking after like any other class of persons that you employ
suppose i didn't look after the clerks in my office just let them run things their own way they'd soon make a nice mess of me and my business  where are you going asked edna seeing that her husband arose from table without having eaten a morsel except a taste of the highlyseasoned soup
i'm going to get my dinner at the club
good night he went into the hall took his hat and stick from the stand and left the house
she was somewhat familiar with such scenes
they had often made her very unhappy
on a few previous occasions she had been completely deprived of any desire to finish her dinner
sometimes she had gone into the kitchen to administer a tardy rebuke to the cook
once she went to her room and studied the cookbook during an entire evening finally writing out a menu for the week which left her harassed with a feeling that after all she had accomplished no good that was worth the name
but that evening edna finished her dinner alone with forced deliberation
her face was flushed and her eyes flamed with some inward fire that lighted them
after finishing her dinner she went to her room having instructed the boy to tell any other callers that she was indisposed
it was a large beautiful room rich and picturesque in the soft dim light which the maid had turned low
she went and stood at an open window and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below
all the mystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage
she was seeking herself and finding herself in just such sweet halfdarkness which met her moods
but the voices were not soothing that came to her from the darkness and the sky above and the stars
they jeered and sounded mournful notes without promise devoid even of hope
she turned back into the room and began to walk to and fro down its whole length without stopping without resting
she carried in her hands a thin handkerchief which she tore into ribbons rolled into a ball and flung from her
once she stopped and taking off her wedding ring flung it upon the carpet
when she saw it lying there she stamped her heel upon it striving to crush it
but her small boot heel did not make an indenture not a mark upon the little glittering circlet
in a sweeping passion she seized a glass vase from the table and flung it upon the tiles of the hearth
she wanted to destroy something
the crash and clatter were what she wanted to hear
a maid alarmed at the din of breaking glass entered the room to discover what was the matter
a vase fell upon the hearth said edna
never mind leave it till morning  oh
you might get some of the glass in your feet ma'am insisted the young woman picking up bits of the broken vase that were scattered upon the carpet
and here's your ring ma'am under the chair  edna held out her hand and taking the ring slipped it upon her finger
xviii   the following morning mr pontellier upon leaving for his office asked edna if she would not meet him in town in order to look at some new fixtures for the library
i hardly think we need new fixtures leonce
don't let us get anything new you are too extravagant
i don't believe you ever think of saving or putting by  the way to become rich is to make money my dear edna not to save it  he said
he regretted that she did not feel inclined to go with him and select new fixtures
he kissed her goodby and told her she was not looking well and must take care of herself
she was unusually pale and very quiet
she stood on the front veranda as he quitted the house and absently picked a few sprays of jessamine that grew upon a trellis near by
she inhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her white morning gown
the boys were dragging along the banquette a small express wagon which they had filled with blocks and sticks
the quadroon was following them with little quick steps having assumed a fictitious animation and alacrity for the occasion
a fruit vender was crying his wares in the street
edna looked straight before her with a selfabsorbed expression upon her face
she felt no interest in anything about her
the street the children the fruit vender the flowers growing there under her eyes were all part and parcel of an alien world which had suddenly become antagonistic
she went back into the house
she had thought of speaking to the cook concerning her blunders of the previous night but mr pontellier had saved her that disagreeable mission for which she was so poorly fitted
mr pontellier's arguments were usually convincing with those whom he employed
he left home feeling quite sure that he and edna would sit down that evening and possibly a few subsequent evenings to a dinner deserving of the name
edna spent an hour or two in looking over some of her old sketches
she could see their shortcomings and defects which were glaring in her eyes
she tried to work a little but found she was not in the humor
finally she gathered together a few of the sketchesthose which she considered the least discreditable and she carried them with her when a little later she dressed and left the house
she looked handsome and distinguished in her street gown
the tan of the seashore had left her face and her forehead was smooth white and polished beneath her heavy yellowbrown hair
there were a few freckles on her face and a small dark mole near the under lip and one on the temple halfhidden in her hair
as edna walked along the street she was thinking of robert
she was still under the spell of her infatuation
she had tried to forget him realizing the inutility of remembering
but the thought of him was like an obsession ever pressing itself upon her
it was not that she dwelt upon details of their acquaintance or recalled in any special or peculiar way his personality it was his being his existence which dominated her thought fading sometimes as if it would melt into the mist of the forgotten reviving again with an intensity which filled her with an incomprehensible longing
edna was on her way to madame ratignolle's
their intimacy begun at grand isle had not declined and they had seen each other with some frequency since their return to the city
the ratignolles lived at no great distance from edna's home on the corner of a side street where monsieur ratignolle owned and conducted a drug store which enjoyed a steady and prosperous trade
his father had been in the business before him and monsieur ratignolle stood well in the community and bore an enviable reputation for integrity and clearheadedness
his family lived in commodious apartments over the store having an entrance on the side within the porte cochere
there was something which edna thought very french very foreign about their whole manner of living
in the large and pleasant salon which extended across the width of the house the ratignolles entertained their friends once a fortnight with a soiree musicale sometimes diversified by cardplaying
there was a friend who played upon the 'cello
one brought his flute and another his violin while there were some who sang and a number who performed upon the piano with various degrees of taste and agility
the ratignolles' soirees musicales were widely known and it was considered a privilege to be invited to them
edna found her friend engaged in assorting the clothes which had returned that morning from the laundry
she at once abandoned her occupation upon seeing edna who had been ushered without ceremony into her presence
'cite can do it as well as i it is really her business she explained to edna who apologized for interrupting her
and she summoned a young black woman whom she instructed in french to be very careful in checking off the list which she handed her
she told her to notice particularly if a fine linen handkerchief of monsieur ratignolle's which was missing last week had been returned and to be sure to set to one side such pieces as required mending and darning
then placing an arm around edna's waist she led her to the front of the house to the salon where it was cool and sweet with the odor of great roses that stood upon the hearth in jars
madame ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home in a neglige which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich melting curves of her white throat
perhaps i shall be able to paint your picture some day said edna with a smile when they were seated
she produced the roll of sketches and started to unfold them
i believe i ought to work again
i feel as if i wanted to be doing something
what do you think of them
do you think it worth while to take it up again and study some more
i might study for a while with laidpore  she knew that madame ratignolle's opinion in such a matter would be next to valueless that she herself had not alone decided but determined but she sought the words of praise and encouragement that would help her to put heart into her venture
your talent is immense dear  nonsense protested edna well pleased
immense i tell you persisted madame ratignolle surveying the sketches one by one at close range then holding them at arm's length narrowing her eyes and dropping her head on one side
surely this bavarian peasant is worthy of framing and this basket of apples
never have i seen anything more lifelike
one might almost be tempted to reach out a hand and take one  edna could not control a feeling which bordered upon complacency at her friend's praise even realizing as she did its true worth
she retained a few of the sketches and gave all the rest to madame ratignolle who appreciated the gift far beyond its value and proudly exhibited the pictures to her husband when he came up from the store a little later for his midday dinner
mr ratignolle was one of those men who are called the salt of the earth
his cheerfulness was unbounded and it was matched by his goodness of heart his broad charity and common sense
he and his wife spoke english with an accent which was only discernible through its unenglish emphasis and a certain carefulness and deliberation
edna's husband spoke english with no accent whatever
the ratignolles understood each other perfectly
if ever the fusion of two human beings into one has been accomplished on this sphere it was surely in their union
as edna seated herself at table with them she thought better a dinner of herbs though it did not take her long to discover that it was no dinner of herbs but a delicious repast simple choice and in every way satisfying
monsieur ratignolle was delighted to see her though he found her looking not so well as at grand isle and he advised a tonic
he talked a good deal on various topics a little politics some city news and neighborhood gossip
he spoke with an animation and earnestness that gave an exaggerated importance to every syllable he uttered
his wife was keenly interested in everything he said laying down her fork the better to listen chiming in taking the words out of his mouth
edna felt depressed rather than soothed after leaving them
the little glimpse of domestic harmony which had been offered her gave her no regret no longing
it was not a condition of life which fitted her and she could see in it but an appalling and hopeless ennui
she was moved by a kind of commiseration for madame ratignollea pity for that colorless existence which never uplifted its possessor beyond the region of blind contentment in which no moment of anguish ever visited her soul in which she would never have the taste of life's delirium
edna vaguely wondered what she meant by life's delirium it had crossed her thought like some unsought extraneous impression
xix   edna could not help but think that it was very foolish very childish to have stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon the tiles
she was visited by no more outbursts moving her to such futile expedients
she began to do as she liked and to feel as she liked
she completely abandoned her tuesdays at home and did not return the visits of those who had called upon her
she made no ineffectual efforts to conduct her household en bonne menagere going and coming as it suited her fancy and so far as she was able lending herself to any passing caprice
mr pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met a certain tacit submissiveness in his wife
but her new and unexpected line of conduct completely bewildered him
it shocked him
then her absolute disregard for her duties as a wife angered him
when mr pontellier became rude edna grew insolent
she had resolved never to take another step backward
it seems to me the utmost folly for a woman at the head of a household and the mother of children to spend in an atelier days which would be better employed contriving for the comfort of her family  i feel like painting answered edna
perhaps i shan't always feel like it  then in god's name paint
but don't let the family go to the devil
there's madame ratignolle because she keeps up her music she doesn't let everything else go to chaos
and she's more of a musician than you are a painter  she isn't a musician and i'm not a painter
it isn't on account of painting that i let things go  on account of what then  oh
i don't know
let me alone you bother me  it sometimes entered mr pontellier's mind to wonder if his wife were not growing a little unbalanced mentally
he could see plainly that she was not herself
that is he could not see that she was becoming herself and daily casting aside that fictitious self which we assume like a garment with which to appear before the world
her husband let her alone as she requested and went away to his office
edna went up to her ateliera bright room in the top of the house
she was working with great energy and interest without accomplishing anything however which satisfied her even in the smallest degree
for a time she had the whole household enrolled in the service of art
the boys posed for her
they thought it amusing at first but the occupation soon lost its attractiveness when they discovered that it was not a game arranged especially for their entertainment
the quadroon sat for hours before edna's palette patient as a savage while the housemaid took charge of the children and the drawingroom went undusted
but the housemaid too served her term as model when edna perceived that the young woman's back and shoulders were molded on classic lines and that her hair loosened from its confining cap became an inspiration
while edna worked she sometimes sang low the little air ah
si tu savais  it moved her with recollections
she could hear again the ripple of the water the flapping sail
she could see the glint of the moon upon the bay and could feel the soft gusty beating of the hot south wind
a subtle current of desire passed through her body weakening her hold upon the brushes and making her eyes burn
there were days when she was very happy without knowing why
she was happy to be alive and breathing when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight the color the odors the luxuriant warmth of some perfect southern day
she liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar places
she discovered many a sunny sleepy corner fashioned to dream in
and she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested
there were days when she was unhappy she did not know whywhen it did not seem worth while to be glad or sorry to be alive or dead when life appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation
she could not work on such a day nor weave fancies to stir her pulses and warm her blood
xx   it was during such a mood that edna hunted up mademoiselle reisz
she had not forgotten the rather disagreeable impression left upon her by their last interview but she nevertheless felt a desire to see herabove all to listen while she played upon the piano
quite early in the afternoon she started upon her quest for the pianist
unfortunately she had mislaid or lost mademoiselle reisz's card and looking up her address in the city directory she found that the woman lived on bienville street some distance away
the directory which fell into her hands was a year or more old however and upon reaching the number indicated edna discovered that the house was occupied by a respectable family of mulattoes who had chambres garnies to let
they had been living there for six months and knew absolutely nothing of a mademoiselle reisz
in fact they knew nothing of any of their neighbors their lodgers were all people of the highest distinction they assured edna
she did not linger to discuss class distinctions with madame pouponne but hastened to a neighboring grocery store feeling sure that mademoiselle would have left her address with the proprietor
he knew mademoiselle reisz a good deal better than he wanted to know her he informed his questioner
in truth he did not want to know her at all or anything concerning herthe most disagreeable and unpopular woman who ever lived in bienville street
he thanked heaven she had left the neighborhood and was equally thankful that he did not know where she had gone
edna's desire to see mademoiselle reisz had increased tenfold since these unlookedfor obstacles had arisen to thwart it
she was wondering who could give her the information she sought when it suddenly occurred to her that madame lebrun would be the one most likely to do so
she knew it was useless to ask madame ratignolle who was on the most distant terms with the musician and preferred to know nothing concerning her
she had once been almost as emphatic in expressing herself upon the subject as the corner grocer
edna knew that madame lebrun had returned to the city for it was the middle of november
and she also knew where the lebruns lived on chartres street
their home from the outside looked like a prison with iron bars before the door and lower windows
the iron bars were a relic of the old regime and no one had ever thought of dislodging them
at the side was a high fence enclosing the garden
a gate or door opening upon the street was locked
edna rang the bell at this side garden gate and stood upon the banquette waiting to be admitted
it was victor who opened the gate for her
a black woman wiping her hands upon her apron was close at his heels
before she saw them edna could hear them in altercation the womanplainly an anomalyclaiming the right to be allowed to perform her duties one of which was to answer the bell
victor was surprised and delighted to see mrs pontellier and he made no attempt to conceal either his astonishment or his delight
he was a darkbrowed goodlooking youngster of nineteen greatly resembling his mother but with ten times her impetuosity
he instructed the black woman to go at once and inform madame lebrun that mrs pontellier desired to see her
the woman grumbled a refusal to do part of her duty when she had not been permitted to do it all and started back to her interrupted task of weeding the garden
whereupon victor administered a rebuke in the form of a volley of abuse which owing to its rapidity and incoherence was all but incomprehensible to edna
whatever it was the rebuke was convincing for the woman dropped her hoe and went mumbling into the house
edna did not wish to enter
it was very pleasant there on the side porch where there were chairs a wicker lounge and a small table
she seated herself for she was tired from her long tramp and she began to rock gently and smooth out the folds of her silk parasol
victor drew up his chair beside her
he at once explained that the black woman's offensive conduct was all due to imperfect training as he was not there to take her in hand
he had only come up from the island the morning before and expected to return next day
he stayed all winter at the island he lived there and kept the place in order and got things ready for the summer visitors
but a man needed occasional relaxation he informed mrs pontellier and every now and again he drummed up a pretext to bring him to the city
my
but he had had a time of it the evening before
he wouldn't want his mother to know and he began to talk in a whisper
he was scintillant with recollections
of course he couldn't think of telling mrs pontellier all about it she being a woman and not comprehending such things
but it all began with a girl peeping and smiling at him through the shutters as he passed by
oh
but she was a beauty
certainly he smiled back and went up and talked to her
mrs pontellier did not know him if she supposed he was one to let an opportunity like that escape him
despite herself the youngster amused her
she must have betrayed in her look some degree of interest or entertainment
the boy grew more daring and mrs pontellier might have found herself in a little while listening to a highly colored story but for the timely appearance of madame lebrun
that lady was still clad in white according to her custom of the summer
her eyes beamed an effusive welcome
would not mrs pontellier go inside
would she partake of some refreshment
why had she not been there before
how was that dear mr pontellier and how were those sweet children
had mrs pontellier ever known such a warm november
victor went and reclined on the wicker lounge behind his mother's chair where he commanded a view of edna's face
he had taken her parasol from her hands while he spoke to her and he now lifted it and twirled it above him as he lay on his back
when madame lebrun complained that it was so dull coming back to the city that she saw so few people now that even victor when he came up from the island for a day or two had so much to occupy him and engage his time then it was that the youth went into contortions on the lounge and winked mischievously at edna
she somehow felt like a confederate in crime and tried to look severe and disapproving
there had been but two letters from robert with little in them they told her
victor said it was really not worth while to go inside for the letters when his mother entreated him to go in search of them
he remembered the contents which in truth he rattled off very glibly when put to the test
one letter was written from vera cruz and the other from the city of mexico
he had met montel who was doing everything toward his advancement
so far the financial situation was no improvement over the one he had left in new orleans but of course the prospects were vastly better
he wrote of the city of mexico the buildings the people and their habits the conditions of life which he found there
he sent his love to the family
he inclosed a check to his mother and hoped she would affectionately remember him to all his friends
that was about the substance of the two letters
edna felt that if there had been a message for her she would have received it
the despondent frame of mind in which she had left home began again to overtake her and she remembered that she wished to find mademoiselle reisz
madame lebrun knew where mademoiselle reisz lived
she gave edna the address regretting that she would not consent to stay and spend the remainder of the afternoon and pay a visit to mademoiselle reisz some other day
the afternoon was already well advanced
victor escorted her out upon the banquette lifted her parasol and held it over her while he walked to the car with her
he entreated her to bear in mind that the disclosures of the afternoon were strictly confidential
she laughed and bantered him a little remembering too late that she should have been dignified and reserved
how handsome mrs pontellier looked said madame lebrun to her son
ravishing he admitted
the city atmosphere has improved her
some way she doesn't seem like the same woman     xxi   some people contended that the reason mademoiselle reisz always chose apartments up under the roof was to discourage the approach of beggars peddlars and callers
there were plenty of windows in her little front room
they were for the most part dingy but as they were nearly always open it did not make so much difference
they often admitted into the room a good deal of smoke and soot but at the same time all the light and air that there was came through them
from her windows could be seen the crescent of the river the masts of ships and the big chimneys of the mississippi steamers
a magnificent piano crowded the apartment
in the next room she slept and in the third and last she harbored a gasoline stove on which she cooked her meals when disinclined to descend to the neighboring restaurant
it was there also that she ate keeping her belongings in a rare old buffet dingy and battered from a hundred years of use
when edna knocked at mademoiselle reisz's front room door and entered she discovered that person standing beside the window engaged in mending or patching an old prunella gaiter
the little musician laughed all over when she saw edna
her laugh consisted of a contortion of the face and all the muscles of the body
she seemed strikingly homely standing there in the afternoon light
she still wore the shabby lace and the artificial bunch of violets on the side of her head
so you remembered me at last said mademoiselle
i had said to myself 'ah bah
she will never come
'  did you want me to come asked edna with a smile
i had not thought much about it answered mademoiselle
the two had seated themselves on a little bumpy sofa which stood against the wall
i am glad however that you came
i have the water boiling back there and was just about to make some coffee
you will drink a cup with me
and how is la belle dame
always handsome
always healthy
always contented she took edna's hand between her strong wiry fingers holding it loosely without warmth and executing a sort of double theme upon the back and palm
yes she went on i sometimes thought 'she will never come
she promised as those women in society always do without meaning it
she will not come'
for i really don't believe you like me mrs pontellier  i don't know whether i like you or not replied edna gazing down at the little woman with a quizzical look
the candor of mrs pontellier's admission greatly pleased mademoiselle reisz
she expressed her gratification by repairing forthwith to the region of the gasoline stove and rewarding her guest with the promised cup of coffee
the coffee and the biscuit accompanying it proved very acceptable to edna who had declined refreshment at madame lebrun's and was now beginning to feel hungry
mademoiselle set the tray which she brought in upon a small table near at hand and seated herself once again on the lumpy sofa
i have had a letter from your friend she remarked as she poured a little cream into edna's cup and handed it to her
my friend  yes your friend robert
he wrote to me from the city of mexico  wrote to you repeated edna in amazement stirring her coffee absently
yes to me
why not
don't stir all the warmth out of your coffee drink it
though the letter might as well have been sent to you it was nothing but mrs pontellier from beginning to end  let me see it requested the young woman entreatingly
no a letter concerns no one but the person who writes it and the one to whom it is written  haven't you just said it concerned me from beginning to end  it was written about you not to you
'have you seen mrs pontellier
how is she looking'
he asks
'as mrs pontellier says' or 'as mrs pontellier once said'
'if mrs pontellier should call upon you play for her that impromptu of chopin's my favorite
i heard it here a day or two ago but not as you play it
i should like to know how it affects her' and so on as if he supposed we were constantly in each other's society  let me see the letter  oh no  have you answered it  no  let me see the letter  no and again no  then play the impromptu for me  it is growing late what time do you have to be home  time doesn't concern me
your question seems a little rude
play the impromptu  but you have told me nothing of yourself
what are you doing  painting laughed edna
i am becoming an artist
think of it  ah
an artist
you have pretensions madame  why pretensions
do you think i could not become an artist  i do not know you well enough to say
i do not know your talent or your temperament
to be an artist includes much one must possess many giftsabsolute giftswhich have not been acquired by one's own effort
and moreover to succeed the artist must possess the courageous soul  what do you mean by the courageous soul  courageous ma foi
the brave soul
the soul that dares and defies  show me the letter and play for me the impromptu
you see that i have persistence
does that quality count for anything in art  it counts with a foolish old woman whom you have captivated replied mademoiselle with her wriggling laugh
the letter was right there at hand in the drawer of the little table upon which edna had just placed her coffee cup
mademoiselle opened the drawer and drew forth the letter the topmost one
she placed it in edna's hands and without further comment arose and went to the piano
mademoiselle played a soft interlude
it was an improvisation
she sat low at the instrument and the lines of her body settled into ungraceful curves and angles that gave it an appearance of deformity
gradually and imperceptibly the interlude melted into the soft opening minor chords of the chopin impromptu
edna did not know when the impromptu began or ended
she sat in the sofa corner reading robert's letter by the fading light
mademoiselle had glided from the chopin into the quivering love notes of isolde's song and back again to the impromptu with its soulful and poignant longing
the shadows deepened in the little room
the music grew strange and fantasticturbulent insistent plaintive and soft with entreaty
the shadows grew deeper
the music filled the room
it floated out upon the night over the housetops the crescent of the river losing itself in the silence of the upper air
edna was sobbing just as she had wept one midnight at grand isle when strange new voices awoke in her
she arose in some agitation to take her departure
may i come again mademoiselle she asked at the threshold
come whenever you feel like it
be careful the stairs and landings are dark don't stumble  mademoiselle reentered and lit a candle
robert's letter was on the floor
she stooped and picked it up
it was crumpled and damp with tears
mademoiselle smoothed the letter out restored it to the envelope and replaced it in the table drawer
xxii   one morning on his way into town mr pontellier stopped at the house of his old friend and family physician doctor mandelet
the doctor was a semiretired physician resting as the saying is upon his laurels
he bore a reputation for wisdom rather than skillleaving the active practice of medicine to his assistants and younger contemporariesand was much sought for in matters of consultation
a few families united to him by bonds of friendship he still attended when they required the services of a physician
the pontelliers were among these
mr pontellier found the doctor reading at the open window of his study
his house stood rather far back from the street in the center of a delightful garden so that it was quiet and peaceful at the old gentleman's study window
he was a great reader
he stared up disapprovingly over his eyeglasses as mr pontellier entered wondering who had the temerity to disturb him at that hour of the morning
ah pontellier
not sick i hope
come and have a seat
what news do you bring this morning he was quite portly with a profusion of gray hair and small blue eyes which age had robbed of much of their brightness but none of their penetration
oh
i'm never sick doctor
you know that i come of tough fiberof that old creole race of pontelliers that dry up and finally blow away
i came to consultno not precisely to consultto talk to you about edna
i don't know what ails her  madame pontellier not well marveled the doctor
why i saw heri think it was a week agowalking along canal street the picture of health it seemed to me  yes yes she seems quite well said mr pontellier leaning forward and whirling his stick between his two hands but she doesn't act well
she's odd she's not like herself
i can't make her out and i thought perhaps you'd help me  how does she act inquired the doctor
well it isn't easy to explain said mr pontellier throwing himself back in his chair
she lets the housekeeping go to the dickens  well well women are not all alike my dear pontellier
we've got to consider  i know that i told you i couldn't explain
her whole attitudetoward me and everybody and everythinghas changed
you know i have a quick temper but i don't want to quarrel or be rude to a woman especially my wife yet i'm driven to it and feel like ten thousand devils after i've made a fool of myself
she's making it devilishly uncomfortable for me he went on nervously
she's got some sort of notion in her head concerning the eternal rights of women andyou understandwe meet in the morning at the breakfast table  the old gentleman lifted his shaggy eyebrows protruded his thick nether lip and tapped the arms of his chair with his cushioned fingertips
what have you been doing to her pontellier  doing
parbleu  has she asked the doctor with a smile has she been associating of late with a circle of pseudointellectual womensuperspiritual superior beings
my wife has been telling me about them  that's the trouble broke in mr pontellier she hasn't been associating with any one
she has abandoned her tuesdays at home has thrown over all her acquaintances and goes tramping about by herself moping in the streetcars getting in after dark
i tell you she's peculiar
i don't like it i feel a little worried over it  this was a new aspect for the doctor
nothing hereditary he asked seriously
nothing peculiar about her family antecedents is there  oh no indeed
she comes of sound old presbyterian kentucky stock
the old gentleman her father i have heard used to atone for his weekday sins with his sunday devotions
i know for a fact that his race horses literally ran away with the prettiest bit of kentucky farming land i ever laid eyes upon
margaretyou know margaretshe has all the presbyterianism undiluted
and the youngest is something of a vixen
by the way she gets married in a couple of weeks from now  send your wife up to the wedding exclaimed the doctor foreseeing a happy solution
let her stay among her own people for a while it will do her good  that's what i want her to do
she won't go to the marriage
she says a wedding is one of the most lamentable spectacles on earth
nice thing for a woman to say to her husband exclaimed mr pontellier fuming anew at the recollection
pontellier said the doctor after a moment's reflection let your wife alone for a while
don't bother her and don't let her bother you
woman my dear friend is a very peculiar and delicate organisma sensitive and highly organized woman such as i know mrs pontellier to be is especially peculiar
it would require an inspired psychologist to deal successfully with them
and when ordinary fellows like you and me attempt to cope with their idiosyncrasies the result is bungling
most women are moody and whimsical
this is some passing whim of your wife due to some cause or causes which you and i needn't try to fathom
but it will pass happily over especially if you let her alone
send her around to see me  oh
i couldn't do that there'd be no reason for it objected mr pontellier
then i'll go around and see her said the doctor
i'll drop in to dinner some evening en bon ami
do
by all means urged mr pontellier
what evening will you come
say thursday
will you come thursday he asked rising to take his leave
very well thursday
my wife may possibly have some engagement for me thursday
in case she has i shall let you know
otherwise you may expect me  mr pontellier turned before leaving to say  i am going to new york on business very soon
i have a big scheme on hand and want to be on the field proper to pull the ropes and handle the ribbons
we'll let you in on the inside if you say so doctor he laughed
no i thank you my dear sir returned the doctor
i leave such ventures to you younger men with the fever of life still in your blood  what i wanted to say continued mr pontellier with his hand on the knob i may have to be absent a good while
would you advise me to take edna along  by all means if she wishes to go
if not leave her here
don't contradict her
the mood will pass i assure you
it may take a month two three monthspossibly longer but it will pass have patience  well goodby a jeudi said mr pontellier as he let himself out
the doctor would have liked during the course of conversation to ask is there any man in the case but he knew his creole too well to make such a blunder as that
he did not resume his book immediately but sat for a while meditatively looking out into the garden
xxiii   edna's father was in the city and had been with them several days
she was not very warmly or deeply attached to him but they had certain tastes in common and when together they were companionable
his coming was in the nature of a welcome disturbance it seemed to furnish a new direction for her emotions
he had come to purchase a wedding gift for his daughter janet and an outfit for himself in which he might make a creditable appearance at her marriage
mr pontellier had selected the bridal gift as every one immediately connected with him always deferred to his taste in such matters
and his suggestions on the question of dresswhich too often assumes the nature of a problemwere of inestimable value to his fatherinlaw
but for the past few days the old gentleman had been upon edna's hands and in his society she was becoming acquainted with a new set of sensations
he had been a colonel in the confederate army and still maintained with the title the military bearing which had always accompanied it
his hair and mustache were white and silky emphasizing the rugged bronze of his face
he was tall and thin and wore his coats padded which gave a fictitious breadth and depth to his shoulders and chest
edna and her father looked very distinguished together and excited a good deal of notice during their perambulations
upon his arrival she began by introducing him to her atelier and making a sketch of him
he took the whole matter very seriously
if her talent had been tenfold greater than it was it would not have surprised him convinced as he was that he had bequeathed to all of his daughters the germs of a masterful capability which only depended upon their own efforts to be directed toward successful achievement
before her pencil he sat rigid and unflinching as he had faced the cannon's mouth in days gone by
he resented the intrusion of the children who gaped with wondering eyes at him sitting so stiff up there in their mother's bright atelier
when they drew near he motioned them away with an expressive action of the foot loath to disturb the fixed lines of his countenance his arms or his rigid shoulders
edna anxious to entertain him invited mademoiselle reisz to meet him having promised him a treat in her piano playing but mademoiselle declined the invitation
so together they attended a soiree musicale at the ratignolles'
monsieur and madame ratignolle made much of the colonel installing him as the guest of honor and engaging him at once to dine with them the following sunday or any day which he might select
madame coquetted with him in the most captivating and naive manner with eyes gestures and a profusion of compliments till the colonel's old head felt thirty years younger on his padded shoulders
edna marveled not comprehending
she herself was almost devoid of coquetry
there were one or two men whom she observed at the soiree musicale but she would never have felt moved to any kittenish display to attract their noticeto any feline or feminine wiles to express herself toward them
their personality attracted her in an agreeable way
her fancy selected them and she was glad when a lull in the music gave them an opportunity to meet her and talk with her
often on the street the glance of strange eyes had lingered in her memory and sometimes had disturbed her
mr pontellier did not attend these soirees musicales
he considered them bourgeois and found more diversion at the club
to madame ratignolle he said the music dispensed at her soirees was too heavy  too far beyond his untrained comprehension
his excuse flattered her
but she disapproved of mr pontellier's club and she was frank enough to tell edna so
it's a pity mr pontellier doesn't stay home more in the evenings
i think you would be morewell if you don't mind my saying itmore united if he did  oh
dear no said edna with a blank look in her eyes
what should i do if he stayed home
we wouldn't have anything to say to each other  she had not much of anything to say to her father for that matter but he did not antagonize her
she discovered that he interested her though she realized that he might not interest her long and for the first time in her life she felt as if she were thoroughly acquainted with him
he kept her busy serving him and ministering to his wants
it amused her to do so
she would not permit a servant or one of the children to do anything for him which she might do herself
her husband noticed and thought it was the expression of a deep filial attachment which he had never suspected
the colonel drank numerous toddies during the course of the day which left him however imperturbed
he was an expert at concocting strong drinks
he had even invented some to which he had given fantastic names and for whose manufacture he required diverse ingredients that it devolved upon edna to procure for him
when doctor mandelet dined with the pontelliers on thursday he could discern in mrs pontellier no trace of that morbid condition which her husband had reported to him
she was excited and in a manner radiant
she and her father had been to the race course and their thoughts when they seated themselves at table were still occupied with the events of the afternoon and their talk was still of the track
the doctor had not kept pace with turf affairs
he had certain recollections of racing in what he called the good old times when the lecompte stables flourished and he drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not be left out and seem wholly devoid of the modern spirit
but he failed to impose upon the colonel and was even far from impressing him with this trumpedup knowledge of bygone days
edna had staked her father on his last venture with the most gratifying results to both of them
besides they had met some very charming people according to the colonel's impressions
mrs mortimer merriman and mrs james highcamp who were there with alcee arobin had joined them and had enlivened the hours in a fashion that warmed him to think of
mr pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward horseracing and was even rather inclined to discourage it as a pastime especially when he considered the fate of that bluegrass farm in kentucky
he endeavored in a general way to express a particular disapproval and only succeeded in arousing the ire and opposition of his fatherinlaw
a pretty dispute followed in which edna warmly espoused her father's cause and the doctor remained neutral
he observed his hostess attentively from under his shaggy brows and noted a subtle change which had transformed her from the listless woman he had known into a being who for the moment seemed palpitant with the forces of life
her speech was warm and energetic
there was no repression in her glance or gesture
she reminded him of some beautiful sleek animal waking up in the sun
the dinner was excellent
the claret was warm and the champagne was cold and under their beneficent influence the threatened unpleasantness melted and vanished with the fumes of the wine
mr pontellier warmed up and grew reminiscent
he told some amusing plantation experiences recollections of old iberville and his youth when he hunted 'possum in company with some friendly darky thrashed the pecan trees shot the grosbec and roamed the woods and fields in mischievous idleness
the colonel with little sense of humor and of the fitness of things related a somber episode of those dark and bitter days in which he had acted a conspicuous part and always formed a central figure
nor was the doctor happier in his selection when he told the old ever new and curious story of the waning of a woman's love seeking strange new channels only to return to its legitimate source after days of fierce unrest
it was one of the many little human documents which had been unfolded to him during his long career as a physician
the story did not seem especially to impress edna
she had one of her own to tell of a woman who paddled away with her lover one night in a pirogue and never came back
they were lost amid the baratarian islands and no one ever heard of them or found trace of them from that day to this
it was a pure invention
she said that madame antoine had related it to her
that also was an invention
perhaps it was a dream she had had
but every glowing word seemed real to those who listened
they could feel the hot breath of the southern night they could hear the long sweep of the pirogue through the glistening moonlit water the beating of birds' wings rising startled from among the reeds in the saltwater pools they could see the faces of the lovers pale close together rapt in oblivious forgetfulness drifting into the unknown
the champagne was cold and its subtle fumes played fantastic tricks with edna's memory that night
outside away from the glow of the fire and the soft lamplight the night was chill and murky
the doctor doubled his oldfashioned cloak across his breast as he strode home through the darkness
he knew his fellowcreatures better than most men knew that inner life which so seldom unfolds itself to unanointed eyes
he was sorry he had accepted pontellier's invitation
he was growing old and beginning to need rest and an imperturbed spirit
he did not want the secrets of other lives thrust upon him
i hope it isn't arobin he muttered to himself as he walked
i hope to heaven it isn't alcee arobin     xxiv   edna and her father had a warm and almost violent dispute upon the subject of her refusal to attend her sister's wedding
mr pontellier declined to interfere to interpose either his influence or his authority
he was following doctor mandelet's advice and letting her do as she liked
the colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of filial kindness and respect her want of sisterly affection and womanly consideration
his arguments were labored and unconvincing
he doubted if janet would accept any excuseforgetting that edna had offered none
he doubted if janet would ever speak to her again and he was sure margaret would not
edna was glad to be rid of her father when he finally took himself off with his wedding garments and his bridal gifts with his padded shoulders his bible reading his toddies and ponderous oaths
mr pontellier followed him closely
he meant to stop at the wedding on his way to new york and endeavor by every means which money and love could devise to atone somewhat for edna's incomprehensible action
you are too lenient too lenient by far leonce asserted the colonel
authority coercion are what is needed
put your foot down good and hard the only way to manage a wife
take my word for it  the colonel was perhaps unaware that he had coerced his own wife into her grave
mr pontellier had a vague suspicion of it which he thought it needless to mention at that late day
edna was not so consciously gratified at her husband's leaving home as she had been over the departure of her father
as the day approached when he was to leave her for a comparatively long stay she grew melting and affectionate remembering his many acts of consideration and his repeated expressions of an ardent attachment
she was solicitous about his health and his welfare
she bustled around looking after his clothing thinking about heavy underwear quite as madame ratignolle would have done under similar circumstances
she cried when he went away calling him her dear good friend and she was quite certain she would grow lonely before very long and go to join him in new york
but after all a radiant peace settled upon her when she at last found herself alone
even the children were gone
old madame pontellier had come herself and carried them off to iberville with their quadroon
the old madame did not venture to say she was afraid they would be neglected during leonce's absence she hardly ventured to think so
she was hungry for themeven a little fierce in her attachment
she did not want them to be wholly children of the pavement she always said when begging to have them for a space
she wished them to know the country with its streams its fields its woods its freedom so delicious to the young
she wished them to taste something of the life their father had lived and known and loved when he too was a little child
when edna was at last alone she breathed a big genuine sigh of relief
a feeling that was unfamiliar but very delicious came over her
she walked all through the house from one room to another as if inspecting it for the first time
she tried the various chairs and lounges as if she had never sat and reclined upon them before
and she perambulated around the outside of the house investigating looking to see if windows and shutters were secure and in order
the flowers were like new acquaintances she approached them in a familiar spirit and made herself at home among them
the garden walks were damp and edna called to the maid to bring out her rubber sandals
and there she stayed and stooped digging around the plants trimming picking dead dry leaves
the children's little dog came out interfering getting in her way
she scolded him laughed at him played with him
the garden smelled so good and looked so pretty in the afternoon sunlight
edna plucked all the bright flowers she could find and went into the house with them she and the little dog
even the kitchen assumed a sudden interesting character which she had never before perceived
she went in to give directions to the cook to say that the butcher would have to bring much less meat that they would require only half their usual quantity of bread of milk and groceries
she told the cook that she herself would be greatly occupied during mr pontellier's absence and she begged her to take all thought and responsibility of the larder upon her own shoulders
that night edna dined alone
the candelabra with a few candles in the center of the table gave all the light she needed
outside the circle of light in which she sat the large diningroom looked solemn and shadowy
the cook placed upon her mettle served a delicious repasta luscious tenderloin broiled a point
the wine tasted good the marron glace seemed to be just what she wanted
it was so pleasant too to dine in a comfortable peignoir
she thought a little sentimentally about leonce and the children and wondered what they were doing
as she gave a dainty scrap or two to the doggie she talked intimately to him about etienne and raoul
he was beside himself with astonishment and delight over these companionable advances and showed his appreciation by his little quick snappy barks and a lively agitation
then edna sat in the library after dinner and read emerson until she grew sleepy
she realized that she had neglected her reading and determined to start anew upon a course of improving studies now that her time was completely her own to do with as she liked
after a refreshing bath edna went to bed
and as she snuggled comfortably beneath the eiderdown a sense of restfulness invaded her such as she had not known before
xxv   when the weather was dark and cloudy edna could not work
she needed the sun to mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point
she had reached a stage when she seemed to be no longer feeling her way working when in the humor with sureness and ease
and being devoid of ambition and striving not toward accomplishment she drew satisfaction from the work in itself
on rainy or melancholy days edna went out and sought the society of the friends she had made at grand isle
or else she stayed indoors and nursed a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own comfort and peace of mind
it was not despair but it seemed to her as if life were passing by leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled
yet there were other days when she listened was led on and deceived by fresh promises which her youth held out to her
she went again to the races and again
alcee arobin and mrs highcamp called for her one bright afternoon in arobin's drag
mrs highcamp was a worldly but unaffected intelligent slim tall blonde woman in the forties with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared
she had a daughter who served her as a pretext for cultivating the society of young men of fashion
alcee arobin was one of them
he was a familiar figure at the race course the opera the fashionable clubs
there was a perpetual smile in his eyes which seldom failed to awaken a corresponding cheerfulness in any one who looked into them and listened to his goodhumored voice
his manner was quiet and at times a little insolent
he possessed a good figure a pleasing face not overburdened with depth of thought or feeling and his dress was that of the conventional man of fashion
he admired edna extravagantly after meeting her at the races with her father
he had met her before on other occasions but she had seemed to him unapproachable until that day
it was at his instigation that mrs highcamp called to ask her to go with them to the jockey club to witness the turf event of the season
there were possibly a few track men out there who knew the race horse as well as edna but there was certainly none who knew it better
she sat between her two companions as one having authority to speak
she laughed at arobin's pretensions and deplored mrs highcamp's ignorance
the race horse was a friend and intimate associate of her childhood
the atmosphere of the stables and the breath of the blue grass paddock revived in her memory and lingered in her nostrils
she did not perceive that she was talking like her father as the sleek geldings ambled in review before them
she played for very high stakes and fortune favored her
the fever of the game flamed in her cheeks and eyes and it got into her blood and into her brain like an intoxicant
people turned their heads to look at her and more than one lent an attentive ear to her utterances hoping thereby to secure the elusive but everdesired tip arobin caught the contagion of excitement which drew him to edna like a magnet
mrs highcamp remained as usual unmoved with her indifferent stare and uplifted eyebrows
edna stayed and dined with mrs highcamp upon being urged to do so
arobin also remained and sent away his drag
the dinner was quiet and uninteresting save for the cheerful efforts of arobin to enliven things
mrs highcamp deplored the absence of her daughter from the races and tried to convey to her what she had missed by going to the dante reading instead of joining them
the girl held a geranium leaf up to her nose and said nothing but looked knowing and noncommittal
mr highcamp was a plain baldheaded man who only talked under compulsion
he was unresponsive
mrs highcamp was full of delicate courtesy and consideration toward her husband
she addressed most of her conversation to him at table
they sat in the library after dinner and read the evening papers together under the droplight while the younger people went into the drawingroom near by and talked
miss highcamp played some selections from grieg upon the piano
she seemed to have apprehended all of the composer's coldness and none of his poetry
while edna listened she could not help wondering if she had lost her taste for music
when the time came for her to go home mr highcamp grunted a lame offer to escort her looking down at his slippered feet with tactless concern
it was arobin who took her home
the car ride was long and it was late when they reached esplanade street
arobin asked permission to enter for a second to light his cigarettehis match safe was empty
he filled his match safe but did not light his cigarette until he left her after she had expressed her willingness to go to the races with him again
edna was neither tired nor sleepy
she was hungry again for the highcamp dinner though of excellent quality had lacked abundance
she rummaged in the larder and brought forth a slice of gruyere and some crackers
she opened a bottle of beer which she found in the icebox
edna felt extremely restless and excited
she vacantly hummed a fantastic tune as she poked at the wood embers on the hearth and munched a cracker
she wanted something to happensomething anything she did not know what
she regretted that she had not made arobin stay a half hour to talk over the horses with her
she counted the money she had won
but there was nothing else to do so she went to bed and tossed there for hours in a sort of monotonous agitation
in the middle of the night she remembered that she had forgotten to write her regular letter to her husband and she decided to do so next day and tell him about her afternoon at the jockey club
she lay wide awake composing a letter which was nothing like the one which she wrote next day
when the maid awoke her in the morning edna was dreaming of mr highcamp playing the piano at the entrance of a music store on canal street while his wife was saying to alcee arobin as they boarded an esplanade street car  what a pity that so much talent has been neglected
but i must go  when a few days later alcee arobin again called for edna in his drag mrs highcamp was not with him
he said they would pick her up
but as that lady had not been apprised of his intention of picking her up she was not at home
the daughter was just leaving the house to attend the meeting of a branch folk lore society and regretted that she could not accompany them
arobin appeared nonplused and asked edna if there were any one else she cared to ask
she did not deem it worth while to go in search of any of the fashionable acquaintances from whom she had withdrawn herself
she thought of madame ratignolle but knew that her fair friend did not leave the house except to take a languid walk around the block with her husband after nightfall
mademoiselle reisz would have laughed at such a request from edna
madame lebrun might have enjoyed the outing but for some reason edna did not want her
so they went alone she and arobin
the afternoon was intensely interesting to her
the excitement came back upon her like a remittent fever
her talk grew familiar and confidential
it was no labor to become intimate with arobin
his manner invited easy confidence
the preliminary stage of becoming acquainted was one which he always endeavored to ignore when a pretty and engaging woman was concerned
he stayed and dined with edna
he stayed and sat beside the wood fire
they laughed and talked and before it was time to go he was telling her how different life might have been if he had known her years before
with ingenuous frankness he spoke of what a wicked illdisciplined boy he had been and impulsively drew up his cuff to exhibit upon his wrist the scar from a saber cut which he had received in a duel outside of paris when he was nineteen
she touched his hand as she scanned the red cicatrice on the inside of his white wrist
a quick impulse that was somewhat spasmodic impelled her fingers to close in a sort of clutch upon his hand
he felt the pressure of her pointed nails in the flesh of his palm
she arose hastily and walked toward the mantel
the sight of a wound or scar always agitates and sickens me she said
i shouldn't have looked at it  i beg your pardon he entreated following her it never occurred to me that it might be repulsive  he stood close to her and the effrontery in his eyes repelled the old vanishing self in her yet drew all her awakening sensuousness
he saw enough in her face to impel him to take her hand and hold it while he said his lingering good night
will you go to the races again he asked
no she said
i've had enough of the races
i don't want to lose all the money i've won and i've got to work when the weather is bright instead of  yes work to be sure
you promised to show me your work
what morning may i come up to your atelier
tomorrow  no  day after  no no  oh please don't refuse me
i know something of such things
i might help you with a stray suggestion or two  no
good night
why don't you go after you have said good night
i don't like you she went on in a high excited pitch attempting to draw away her hand
she felt that her words lacked dignity and sincerity and she knew that he felt it
i'm sorry you don't like me
i'm sorry i offended you
how have i offended you
what have i done
can't you forgive me and he bent and pressed his lips upon her hand as if he wished never more to withdraw them
mr
arobin she complained i'm greatly upset by the excitement of the afternoon i'm not myself
my manner must have misled you in some way
i wish you to go please she spoke in a monotonous dull tone
he took his hat from the table and stood with eyes turned from her looking into the dying fire
for a moment or two he kept an impressive silence
your manner has not misled me mrs pontellier he said finally
my own emotions have done that
i couldn't help it
when i'm near you how could i help it
don't think anything of it don't bother please
you see i go when you command me
if you wish me to stay away i shall do so
if you let me come back ioh
you will let me come back  he cast one appealing glance at her to which she made no response
alcee arobin's manner was so genuine that it often deceived even himself
edna did not care or think whether it were genuine or not
when she was alone she looked mechanically at the back of her hand which he had kissed so warmly
then she leaned her head down on the mantelpiece
she felt somewhat like a woman who in a moment of passion is betrayed into an act of infidelity and realizes the significance of the act without being wholly awakened from its glamour
the thought was passing vaguely through her mind what would he think  she did not mean her husband she was thinking of robert lebrun
her husband seemed to her now like a person whom she had married without love as an excuse
she lit a candle and went up to her room
alcee arobin was absolutely nothing to her
yet his presence his manners the warmth of his glances and above all the touch of his lips upon her hand had acted like a narcotic upon her
she slept a languorous sleep interwoven with vanishing dreams
xxvi   alcee arobin wrote edna an elaborate note of apology palpitant with sincerity
it embarrassed her for in a cooler quieter moment it appeared to her absurd that she should have taken his action so seriously so dramatically
she felt sure that the significance of the whole occurrence had lain in her own selfconsciousness
if she ignored his note it would give undue importance to a trivial affair
if she replied to it in a serious spirit it would still leave in his mind the impression that she had in a susceptible moment yielded to his influence
after all it was no great matter to have one's hand kissed
she was provoked at his having written the apology
she answered in as light and bantering a spirit as she fancied it deserved and said she would be glad to have him look in upon her at work whenever he felt the inclination and his business gave him the opportunity
he responded at once by presenting himself at her home with all his disarming naivete
and then there was scarcely a day which followed that she did not see him or was not reminded of him
he was prolific in pretexts
his attitude became one of goodhumored subservience and tacit adoration
he was ready at all times to submit to her moods which were as often kind as they were cold
she grew accustomed to him
they became intimate and friendly by imperceptible degrees and then by leaps
he sometimes talked in a way that astonished her at first and brought the crimson into her face in a way that pleased her at last appealing to the animalism that stirred impatiently within her
there was nothing which so quieted the turmoil of edna's senses as a visit to mademoiselle reisz
it was then in the presence of that personality which was offensive to her that the woman by her divine art seemed to reach edna's spirit and set it free
it was misty with heavy lowering atmosphere one afternoon when edna climbed the stairs to the pianist's apartments under the roof
her clothes were dripping with moisture
she felt chilled and pinched as she entered the room
mademoiselle was poking at a rusty stove that smoked a little and warmed the room indifferently
she was endeavoring to heat a pot of chocolate on the stove
the room looked cheerless and dingy to edna as she entered
a bust of beethoven covered with a hood of dust scowled at her from the mantelpiece
ah
here comes the sunlight exclaimed mademoiselle rising from her knees before the stove
now it will be warm and bright enough i can let the fire alone  she closed the stove door with a bang and approaching assisted in removing edna's dripping mackintosh
you are cold you look miserable
the chocolate will soon be hot
but would you rather have a taste of brandy
i have scarcely touched the bottle which you brought me for my cold a piece of red flannel was wrapped around mademoiselle's throat a stiff neck compelled her to hold her head on one side
i will take some brandy said edna shivering as she removed her gloves and overshoes
she drank the liquor from the glass as a man would have done
then flinging herself upon the uncomfortable sofa she said mademoiselle i am going to move away from my house on esplanade street  ah ejaculated the musician neither surprised nor especially interested
nothing ever seemed to astonish her very much
she was endeavoring to adjust the bunch of violets which had become loose from its fastening in her hair
edna drew her down upon the sofa and taking a pin from her own hair secured the shabby artificial flowers in their accustomed place
aren't you astonished  passably
where are you going
to new york
to iberville
to your father in mississippi
where  just two steps away laughed edna in a little fourroom house around the corner
it looks so cozy so inviting and restful whenever i pass by and it's for rent
i'm tired looking after that big house
it never seemed like mine anywaylike home
it's too much trouble
i have to keep too many servants
i am tired bothering with them  that is not your true reason ma belle
there is no use in telling me lies
i don't know your reason but you have not told me the truth  edna did not protest or endeavor to justify herself
the house the money that provides for it are not mine
isn't that enough reason  they are your husband's returned mademoiselle with a shrug and a malicious elevation of the eyebrows
oh
i see there is no deceiving you
then let me tell you it is a caprice
i have a little money of my own from my mother's estate which my father sends me by driblets
i won a large sum this winter on the races and i am beginning to sell my sketches
laidpore is more and more pleased with my work he says it grows in force and individuality
i cannot judge of that myself but i feel that i have gained in ease and confidence
however as i said i have sold a good many through laidpore
i can live in the tiny house for little or nothing with one servant
old celestine who works occasionally for me says she will come stay with me and do my work
i know i shall like it like the feeling of freedom and independence  what does your husband say  i have not told him yet
i only thought of it this morning
he will think i am demented no doubt
perhaps you think so  mademoiselle shook her head slowly
your reason is not yet clear to me she said
neither was it quite clear to edna herself but it unfolded itself as she sat for a while in silence
instinct had prompted her to put away her husband's bounty in casting off her allegiance
she did not know how it would be when he returned
there would have to be an understanding an explanation
conditions would some way adjust themselves she felt but whatever came she had resolved never again to belong to another than herself
i shall give a grand dinner before i leave the old house edna exclaimed
you will have to come to it mademoiselle
i will give you everything that you like to eat and to drink
we shall sing and laugh and be merry for once and she uttered a sigh that came from the very depths of her being
if mademoiselle happened to have received a letter from robert during the interval of edna's visits she would give her the letter unsolicited
and she would seat herself at the piano and play as her humor prompted her while the young woman read the letter
the little stove was roaring it was redhot and the chocolate in the tin sizzled and sputtered
edna went forward and opened the stove door and mademoiselle rising took a letter from under the bust of beethoven and handed it to edna
another
so soon she exclaimed her eyes filled with delight
tell me mademoiselle does he know that i see his letters  never in the world
he would be angry and would never write to me again if he thought so
does he write to you
never a line
does he send you a message
never a word
it is because he loves you poor fool and is trying to forget you since you are not free to listen to him or to belong to him  why do you show me his letters then  haven't you begged for them
can i refuse you anything
oh
you cannot deceive me and mademoiselle approached her beloved instrument and began to play
edna did not at once read the letter
she sat holding it in her hand while the music penetrated her whole being like an effulgence warming and brightening the dark places of her soul
it prepared her for joy and exultation
oh she exclaimed letting the letter fall to the floor
why did you not tell me she went and grasped mademoiselle's hands up from the keys
oh
unkind
malicious
why did you not tell me  that he was coming back
no great news ma foi
i wonder he did not come long ago  but when when cried edna impatiently
he does not say when  he says 'very soon'
you know as much about it as i do it is all in the letter  but why
why is he coming
oh if i thought and she snatched the letter from the floor and turned the pages this way and that way looking for the reason which was left untold
if i were young and in love with a man said mademoiselle turning on the stool and pressing her wiry hands between her knees as she looked down at edna who sat on the floor holding the letter it seems to me he would have to be some grand esprit a man with lofty aims and ability to reach them one who stood high enough to attract the notice of his fellowmen
it seems to me if i were young and in love i should never deem a man of ordinary caliber worthy of my devotion  now it is you who are telling lies and seeking to deceive me mademoiselle or else you have never been in love and know nothing about it
why went on edna clasping her knees and looking up into mademoiselle's twisted face do you suppose a woman knows why she loves
does she select
does she say to herself 'go to
here is a distinguished statesman with presidential possibilities i shall proceed to fall in love with him'
or 'i shall set my heart upon this musician whose fame is on every tongue'
or 'this financier who controls the world's money markets'
you are purposely misunderstanding me ma reine
are you in love with robert  yes said edna
it was the first time she had admitted it and a glow overspread her face blotching it with red spots
why asked her companion
why do you love him when you ought not to  edna with a motion or two dragged herself on her knees before mademoiselle reisz who took the glowing face between her two hands
why
because his hair is brown and grows away from his temples because he opens and shuts his eyes and his nose is a little out of drawing because he has two lips and a square chin and a little finger which he can't straighten from having played baseball too energetically in his youth
because  because you do in short laughed mademoiselle
what will you do when he comes back she asked
do
nothing except feel glad and happy to be alive  she was already glad and happy to be alive at the mere thought of his return
the murky lowering sky which had depressed her a few hours before seemed bracing and invigorating as she splashed through the streets on her way home
she stopped at a confectioner's and ordered a huge box of bonbons for the children in iberville
she slipped a card in the box on which she scribbled a tender message and sent an abundance of kisses
before dinner in the evening edna wrote a charming letter to her husband telling him of her intention to move for a while into the little house around the block and to give a farewell dinner before leaving regretting that he was not there to share it to help out with the menu and assist her in entertaining the guests
her letter was brilliant and brimming with cheerfulness
xxvii   what is the matter with you asked arobin that evening
i never found you in such a happy mood edna was tired by that time and was reclining on the lounge before the fire
don't you know the weather prophet has told us we shall see the sun pretty soon  well that ought to be reason enough he acquiesced
you wouldn't give me another if i sat here all night imploring you he sat close to her on a low tabouret and as he spoke his fingers lightly touched the hair that fell a little over her forehead
she liked the touch of his fingers through her hair and closed her eyes sensitively
one of these days she said i'm going to pull myself together for a while and thinktry to determine what character of a woman i am for candidly i don't know
by all the codes which i am acquainted with i am a devilishly wicked specimen of the sex
but some way i can't convince myself that i am
i must think about it  don't
what's the use
why should you bother thinking about it when i can tell you what manner of woman you are his fingers strayed occasionally down to her warm smooth cheeks and firm chin which was growing a little full and double
oh yes
you will tell me that i am adorable everything that is captivating
spare yourself the effort  no i shan't tell you anything of the sort though i shouldn't be lying if i did  do you know mademoiselle reisz she asked irrelevantly
the pianist
i know her by sight
i've heard her play  she says queer things sometimes in a bantering way that you don't notice at the time and you find yourself thinking about afterward  for instance  well for instance when i left her today she put her arms around me and felt my shoulder blades to see if my wings were strong she said
'the bird that would soar above the level plain of tradition and prejudice must have strong wings
it is a sad spectacle to see the weaklings bruised exhausted fluttering back to earth'
whither would you soar  i'm not thinking of any extraordinary flights
i only half comprehend her  i've heard she's partially demented said arobin
she seems to me wonderfully sane edna replied
i'm told she's extremely disagreeable and unpleasant
why have you introduced her at a moment when i desired to talk of you  oh
talk of me if you like cried edna clasping her hands beneath her head but let me think of something else while you do  i'm jealous of your thoughts tonight
they're making you a little kinder than usual but some way i feel as if they were wandering as if they were not here with me she only looked at him and smiled
his eyes were very near
he leaned upon the lounge with an arm extended across her while the other hand still rested upon her hair
they continued silently to look into each other's eyes
when he leaned forward and kissed her she clasped his head holding his lips to hers
it was the first kiss of her life to which her nature had really responded
it was a flaming torch that kindled desire
xxviii   edna cried a little that night after arobin left her
it was only one phase of the multitudinous emotions which had assailed her
there was with her an overwhelming feeling of irresponsibility
there was the shock of the unexpected and the unaccustomed
there was her husband's reproach looking at her from the external things around her which he had provided for her external existence
there was robert's reproach making itself felt by a quicker fiercer more overpowering love which had awakened within her toward him
above all there was understanding
she felt as if a mist had been lifted from her eyes enabling her to took upon and comprehend the significance of life that monster made up of beauty and brutality
but among the conflicting sensations which assailed her there was neither shame nor remorse
there was a dull pang of regret because it was not the kiss of love which had inflamed her because it was not love which had held this cup of life to her lips
xxix   without even waiting for an answer from her husband regarding his opinion or wishes in the matter edna hastened her preparations for quitting her home on esplanade street and moving into the little house around the block
a feverish anxiety attended her every action in that direction
there was no moment of deliberation no interval of repose between the thought and its fulfillment
early upon the morning following those hours passed in arobin's society edna set about securing her new abode and hurrying her arrangements for occupying it
within the precincts of her home she felt like one who has entered and lingered within the portals of some forbidden temple in which a thousand muffled voices bade her begone
whatever was her own in the house everything which she had acquired aside from her husband's bounty she caused to be transported to the other house supplying simple and meager deficiencies from her own resources
arobin found her with rolled sleeves working in company with the housemaid when he looked in during the afternoon
she was splendid and robust and had never appeared handsomer than in the old blue gown with a red silk handkerchief knotted at random around her head to protect her hair from the dust
she was mounted upon a high stepladder unhooking a picture from the wall when he entered
he had found the front door open and had followed his ring by walking in unceremoniously
come down he said
do you want to kill yourself she greeted him with affected carelessness and appeared absorbed in her occupation
if he had expected to find her languishing reproachful or indulging in sentimental tears he must have been greatly surprised
he was no doubt prepared for any emergency ready for any one of the foregoing attitudes just as he bent himself easily and naturally to the situation which confronted him
please come down he insisted holding the ladder and looking up at her
no she answered ellen is afraid to mount the ladder
joe is working over at the 'pigeon house'that's the name ellen gives it because it's so small and looks like a pigeon houseand some one has to do this  arobin pulled off his coat and expressed himself ready and willing to tempt fate in her place
ellen brought him one of her dustcaps and went into contortions of mirth which she found it impossible to control when she saw him put it on before the mirror as grotesquely as he could
edna herself could not refrain from smiling when she fastened it at his request
so it was he who in turn mounted the ladder unhooking pictures and curtains and dislodging ornaments as edna directed
when he had finished he took off his dustcap and went out to wash his hands
edna was sitting on the tabouret idly brushing the tips of a feather duster along the carpet when he came in again
is there anything more you will let me do he asked
that is all she answered
ellen can manage the rest she kept the young woman occupied in the drawingroom unwilling to be left alone with arobin
what about the dinner he asked the grand event the coup d'etat  it will be day after tomorrow
why do you call it the 'coup d'etat'
oh
it will be very fine all my best of everythingcrystal silver and gold sevres flowers music and champagne to swim in
i'll let leonce pay the bills
i wonder what he'll say when he sees the bills
and you ask me why i call it a coup d'etat arobin had put on his coat and he stood before her and asked if his cravat was plumb
she told him it was looking no higher than the tip of his collar
when do you go to the 'pigeon house'
with all due acknowledgment to ellen  day after tomorrow after the dinner
i shall sleep there  ellen will you very kindly get me a glass of water asked arobin
the dust in the curtains if you will pardon me for hinting such a thing has parched my throat to a crisp  while ellen gets the water said edna rising i will say goodby and let you go
i must get rid of this grime and i have a million things to do and think of  when shall i see you asked arobin seeking to detain her the maid having left the room
at the dinner of course
you are invited  not beforenot tonight or tomorrow morning or tomorrow noon or night
or the day after morning or noon
can't you see yourself without my telling you what an eternity it is  he had followed her into the hall and to the foot of the stairway looking up at her as she mounted with her face half turned to him
not an instant sooner she said
but she laughed and looked at him with eyes that at once gave him courage to wait and made it torture to wait
xxx   though edna had spoken of the dinner as a very grand affair it was in truth a very small affair and very select in so much as the guests invited were few and were selected with discrimination
she had counted upon an even dozen seating themselves at her round mahogany board forgetting for the moment that madame ratignolle was to the last degree souffrante and unpresentable and not foreseeing that madame lebrun would send a thousand regrets at the last moment
so there were only ten after all which made a cozy comfortable number
there were mr and mrs merriman a pretty vivacious little woman in the thirties her husband a jovial fellow something of a shallowpate who laughed a good deal at other people's witticisms and had thereby made himself extremely popular
mrs highcamp had accompanied them
of course there was alcee arobin and mademoiselle reisz had consented to come
edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace trimmings for her hair
monsieur ratignolle brought himself and his wife's excuses
victor lebrun who happened to be in the city bent upon relaxation had accepted with alacrity
there was a miss mayblunt no longer in her teens who looked at the world through lorgnettes and with the keenest interest
it was thought and said that she was intellectual it was suspected of her that she wrote under a nom de guerre
she had come with a gentleman by the name of gouvernail connected with one of the daily papers of whom nothing special could be said except that he was observant and seemed quiet and inoffensive
edna herself made the tenth and at halfpast eight they seated themselves at table arobin and monsieur ratignolle on either side of their hostess
mrs highcamp sat between arobin and victor lebrun
then came mrs merriman mr gouvernail miss mayblunt mr merriman and mademoiselle reisz next to monsieur ratignolle
there was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the table an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin under strips of lacework
there were wax candles in massive brass candelabra burning softly under yellow silk shades full fragrant roses yellow and red abounded
there were silver and gold as she had said there would be and crystal which glittered like the gems which the women wore
the ordinary stiff dining chairs had been discarded for the occasion and replaced by the most commodious and luxurious which could be collected throughout the house
mademoiselle reisz being exceedingly diminutive was elevated upon cushions as small children are sometimes hoisted at table upon bulky volumes
something new edna exclaimed miss mayblunt with lorgnette directed toward a magnificent cluster of diamonds that sparkled that almost sputtered in edna's hair just over the center of her forehead
quite new 'brand' new in fact a present from my husband
it arrived this morning from new york
i may as well admit that this is my birthday and that i am twentynine
in good time i expect you to drink my health
meanwhile i shall ask you to begin with this cocktail composedwould you say 'composed
' with an appeal to miss maybluntcomposed by my father in honor of sister janet's wedding  before each guest stood a tiny glass that looked and sparkled like a garnet gem
then all things considered spoke arobin it might not be amiss to start out by drinking the colonel's health in the cocktail which he composed on the birthday of the most charming of womenthe daughter whom he invented  mr merriman's laugh at this sally was such a genuine outburst and so contagious that it started the dinner with an agreeable swing that never slackened
miss mayblunt begged to be allowed to keep her cocktail untouched before her just to look at
the color was marvelous
she could compare it to nothing she had ever seen and the garnet lights which it emitted were unspeakably rare
she pronounced the colonel an artist and stuck to it
monsieur ratignolle was prepared to take things seriously the mets the entremets the service the decorations even the people
he looked up from his pompano and inquired of arobin if he were related to the gentleman of that name who formed one of the firm of laitner and arobin lawyers
the young man admitted that laitner was a warm personal friend who permitted arobin's name to decorate the firm's letterheads and to appear upon a shingle that graced perdido street
there are so many inquisitive people and institutions abounding said arobin that one is really forced as a matter of convenience these days to assume the virtue of an occupation if he has it not monsieur ratignolle stared a little and turned to ask mademoiselle reisz if she considered the symphony concerts up to the standard which had been set the previous winter
mademoiselle reisz answered monsieur ratignolle in french which edna thought a little rude under the circumstances but characteristic
mademoiselle had only disagreeable things to say of the symphony concerts and insulting remarks to make of all the musicians of new orleans singly and collectively
all her interest seemed to be centered upon the delicacies placed before her
mr merriman said that mr arobin's remark about inquisitive people reminded him of a man from waco the other day at the st charles hotelbut as mr merriman's stories were always lame and lacking point his wife seldom permitted him to complete them
she interrupted him to ask if he remembered the name of the author whose book she had bought the week before to send to a friend in geneva
she was talking books  with mr gouvernail and trying to draw from him his opinion upon current literary topics
her husband told the story of the waco man privately to miss mayblunt who pretended to be greatly amused and to think it extremely clever
mrs highcamp hung with languid but unaffected interest upon the warm and impetuous volubility of her lefthand neighbor victor lebrun
her attention was never for a moment withdrawn from him after seating herself at table and when he turned to mrs merriman who was prettier and more vivacious than mrs highcamp she waited with easy indifference for an opportunity to reclaim his attention
there was the occasional sound of music of mandolins sufficiently removed to be an agreeable accompaniment rather than an interruption to the conversation
outside the soft monotonous splash of a fountain could be heard the sound penetrated into the room with the heavy odor of jessamine that came through the open windows
the golden shimmer of edna's satin gown spread in rich folds on either side of her
there was a soft fall of lace encircling her shoulders
it was the color of her skin without the glow the myriad living tints that one may sometimes discover in vibrant flesh
there was something in her attitude in her whole appearance when she leaned her head against the highbacked chair and spread her arms which suggested the regal woman the one who rules who looks on who stands alone
but as she sat there amid her guests she felt the old ennui overtaking her the hopelessness which so often assailed her which came upon her like an obsession like something extraneous independent of volition
it was something which announced itself a chill breath that seemed to issue from some vast cavern wherein discords waited
there came over her the acute longing which always summoned into her spiritual vision the presence of the beloved one overpowering her at once with a sense of the unattainable
the moments glided on while a feeling of good fellowship passed around the circle like a mystic cord holding and binding these people together with jest and laughter
monsieur ratignolle was the first to break the pleasant charm
at ten o'clock he excused himself
madame ratignolle was waiting for him at home
she was bien souffrante and she was filled with vague dread which only her husband's presence could allay
mademoiselle reisz arose with monsieur ratignolle who offered to escort her to the car
she had eaten well she had tasted the good rich wines and they must have turned her head for she bowed pleasantly to all as she withdrew from table
she kissed edna upon the shoulder and whispered bonne nuit ma reine soyez sage she had been a little bewildered upon rising or rather descending from her cushions and monsieur ratignolle gallantly took her arm and led her away
mrs highcamp was weaving a garland of roses yellow and red
when she had finished the garland she laid it lightly upon victor's black curls
he was reclining far back in the luxurious chair holding a glass of champagne to the light
as if a magician's wand had touched him the garland of roses transformed him into a vision of oriental beauty
his cheeks were the color of crushed grapes and his dusky eyes glowed with a languishing fire
sapristi exclaimed arobin
but mrs highcamp had one more touch to add to the picture
she took from the back of her chair a white silken scarf with which she had covered her shoulders in the early part of the evening
she draped it across the boy in graceful folds and in a way to conceal his black conventional evening dress
he did not seem to mind what she did to him only smiled showing a faint gleam of white teeth while he continued to gaze with narrowing eyes at the light through his glass of champagne
oh
to be able to paint in color rather than in words exclaimed miss mayblunt losing herself in a rhapsodic dream as she looked at him
'there was a graven image of desire painted with red blood on a ground of gold
' murmured gouvernail under his breath
the effect of the wine upon victor was to change his accustomed volubility into silence
he seemed to have abandoned himself to a reverie and to be seeing pleasing visions in the amber bead
sing entreated mrs highcamp
won't you sing to us  let him alone said arobin
he's posing offered mr merriman let him have it out  i believe he's paralyzed laughed mrs merriman
and leaning over the youth's chair she took the glass from his hand and held it to his lips
he sipped the wine slowly and when he had drained the glass she laid it upon the table and wiped his lips with her little filmy handkerchief
yes i'll sing for you he said turning in his chair toward mrs highcamp
he clasped his hands behind his head and looking up at the ceiling began to hum a little trying his voice like a musician tuning an instrument
then looking at edna he began to sing       ah
si tu savais  stop she cried don't sing that
i don't want you to sing it  and she laid her glass so impetuously and blindly upon the table as to shatter it against a carafe
the wine spilled over arobin's legs and some of it trickled down upon mrs highcamp's black gauze gown
victor had lost all idea of courtesy or else he thought his hostess was not in earnest for he laughed and went on        ah
si tu savais       ce que tes yeux me disent  oh
you mustn't
you mustn't exclaimed edna and pushing back her chair she got up and going behind him placed her hand over his mouth
he kissed the soft palm that pressed upon his lips
no no i won't mrs pontellier
i didn't know you meant it looking up at her with caressing eyes
the touch of his lips was like a pleasing sting to her hand
she lifted the garland of roses from his head and flung it across the room
come victor you've posed long enough
give mrs highcamp her scarf  mrs highcamp undraped the scarf from about him with her own hands
miss mayblunt and mr gouvernail suddenly conceived the notion that it was time to say good night
and mr and mrs merriman wondered how it could be so late
before parting from victor mrs highcamp invited him to call upon her daughter who she knew would be charmed to meet him and talk french and sing french songs with him
victor expressed his desire and intention to call upon miss highcamp at the first opportunity which presented itself
he asked if arobin were going his way
arobin was not
the mandolin players had long since stolen away
a profound stillness had fallen upon the broad beautiful street
the voices of edna's disbanding guests jarred like a discordant note upon the quiet harmony of the night
xxxi   well questioned arobin who had remained with edna after the others had departed
well she reiterated and stood up stretching her arms and feeling the need to relax her muscles after having been so long seated
what next he asked
the servants are all gone
they left when the musicians did
i have dismissed them
the house has to be closed and locked and i shall trot around to the pigeon house and shall send celestine over in the morning to straighten things up  he looked around and began to turn out some of the lights
what about upstairs he inquired
i think it is all right but there may be a window or two unlatched
we had better look you might take a candle and see
and bring me my wrap and hat on the foot of the bed in the middle room  he went up with the light and edna began closing doors and windows
she hated to shut in the smoke and the fumes of the wine
arobin found her cape and hat which he brought down and helped her to put on
when everything was secured and the lights put out they left through the front door arobin locking it and taking the key which he carried for edna
he helped her down the steps
will you have a spray of jessamine he asked breaking off a few blossoms as he passed
no i don't want anything  she seemed disheartened and had nothing to say
she took his arm which he offered her holding up the weight of her satin train with the other hand
she looked down noticing the black line of his leg moving in and out so close to her against the yellow shimmer of her gown
there was the whistle of a railway train somewhere in the distance and the midnight bells were ringing
they met no one in their short walk
the pigeon house stood behind a locked gate and a shallow parterre that had been somewhat neglected
there was a small front porch upon which a long window and the front door opened
the door opened directly into the parlor there was no side entry
back in the yard was a room for servants in which old celestine had been ensconced
edna had left a lamp burning low upon the table
she had succeeded in making the room look habitable and homelike
there were some books on the table and a lounge near at hand
on the floor was a fresh matting covered with a rug or two and on the walls hung a few tasteful pictures
but the room was filled with flowers
these were a surprise to her
arobin had sent them and had had celestine distribute them during edna's absence
her bedroom was adjoining and across a small passage were the diningroom and kitchen
edna seated herself with every appearance of discomfort
are you tired he asked
yes and chilled and miserable
i feel as if i had been wound up to a certain pitchtoo tightand something inside of me had snapped she rested her head against the table upon her bare arm
you want to rest he said and to be quiet
i'll go i'll leave you and let you rest  yes she replied
he stood up beside her and smoothed her hair with his soft magnetic hand
his touch conveyed to her a certain physical comfort
she could have fallen quietly asleep there if he had continued to pass his hand over her hair
he brushed the hair upward from the nape of her neck
i hope you will feel better and happier in the morning he said
you have tried to do too much in the past few days
the dinner was the last straw you might have dispensed with it  yes she admitted it was stupid  no it was delightful but it has worn you out his hand had strayed to her beautiful shoulders and he could feel the response of her flesh to his touch
he seated himself beside her and kissed her lightly upon the shoulder
i thought you were going away she said in an uneven voice
i am after i have said good night  good night she murmured
he did not answer except to continue to caress her
he did not say good night until she had become supple to his gentle seductive entreaties
xxxii   when mr pontellier learned of his wife's intention to abandon her home and take up her residence elsewhere he immediately wrote her a letter of unqualified disapproval and remonstrance
she had given reasons which he was unwilling to acknowledge as adequate
he hoped she had not acted upon her rash impulse and he begged her to consider first foremost and above all else what people would say
he was not dreaming of scandal when he uttered this warning that was a thing which would never have entered into his mind to consider in connection with his wife's name or his own
he was simply thinking of his financial integrity
it might get noised about that the pontelliers had met with reverses and were forced to conduct their menage on a humbler scale than heretofore
it might do incalculable mischief to his business prospects
but remembering edna's whimsical turn of mind of late and foreseeing that she had immediately acted upon her impetuous determination he grasped the situation with his usual promptness and handled it with his wellknown business tact and cleverness
the same mail which brought to edna his letter of disapproval carried instructionsthe most minute instructionsto a wellknown architect concerning the remodeling of his home changes which he had long contemplated and which he desired carried forward during his temporary absence
expert and reliable packers and movers were engaged to convey the furniture carpets pictureseverything movable in shortto places of security
and in an incredibly short time the pontellier house was turned over to the artisans
there was to be an additiona small snuggery there was to be frescoing and hardwood flooring was to be put into such rooms as had not yet been subjected to this improvement
furthermore in one of the daily papers appeared a brief notice to the effect that mr and mrs pontellier were contemplating a summer sojourn abroad and that their handsome residence on esplanade street was undergoing sumptuous alterations and would not be ready for occupancy until their return
mr pontellier had saved appearances
edna admired the skill of his maneuver and avoided any occasion to balk his intentions
when the situation as set forth by mr pontellier was accepted and taken for granted she was apparently satisfied that it should be so
the pigeon house pleased her
it at once assumed the intimate character of a home while she herself invested it with a charm which it reflected like a warm glow
there was with her a feeling of having descended in the social scale with a corresponding sense of having risen in the spiritual
every step which she took toward relieving herself from obligations added to her strength and expansion as an individual
she began to look with her own eyes to see and to apprehend the deeper undercurrents of life
no longer was she content to feed upon opinion  when her own soul had invited her
after a little while a few days in fact edna went up and spent a week with her children in iberville
they were delicious february days with all the summer's promise hovering in the air
how glad she was to see the children
she wept for very pleasure when she felt their little arms clasping her their hard ruddy cheeks pressed against her own glowing cheeks
she looked into their faces with hungry eyes that could not be satisfied with looking
and what stories they had to tell their mother
about the pigs the cows the mules
about riding to the mill behind gluglu fishing back in the lake with their uncle jasper picking pecans with lidie's little black brood and hauling chips in their express wagon
it was a thousand times more fun to haul real chips for old lame susie's real fire than to drag painted blocks along the banquette on esplanade street
she went with them herself to see the pigs and the cows to look at the darkies laying the cane to thrash the pecan trees and catch fish in the back lake
she lived with them a whole week long giving them all of herself and gathering and filling herself with their young existence
they listened breathless when she told them the house in esplanade street was crowded with workmen hammering nailing sawing and filling the place with clatter
they wanted to know where their bed was what had been done with their rockinghorse and where did joe sleep and where had ellen gone and the cook
but above all they were fired with a desire to see the little house around the block
was there any place to play
were there any boys next door
raoul with pessimistic foreboding was convinced that there were only girls next door
where would they sleep and where would papa sleep
she told them the fairies would fix it all right
the old madame was charmed with edna's visit and showered all manner of delicate attentions upon her
she was delighted to know that the esplanade street house was in a dismantled condition
it gave her the promise and pretext to keep the children indefinitely
it was with a wrench and a pang that edna left her children
she carried away with her the sound of their voices and the touch of their cheeks
all along the journey homeward their presence lingered with her like the memory of a delicious song
but by the time she had regained the city the song no longer echoed in her soul
she was again alone
xxxiii   it happened sometimes when edna went to see mademoiselle reisz that the little musician was absent giving a lesson or making some small necessary household purchase
the key was always left in a secret hidingplace in the entry which edna knew
if mademoiselle happened to be away edna would usually enter and wait for her return
when she knocked at mademoiselle reisz's door one afternoon there was no response so unlocking the door as usual she entered and found the apartment deserted as she had expected
her day had been quite filled up and it was for a rest for a refuge and to talk about robert that she sought out her friend
she had worked at her canvasa young italian character studyall the morning completing the work without the model but there had been many interruptions some incident to her modest housekeeping and others of a social nature
madame ratignolle had dragged herself over avoiding the too public thoroughfares she said
she complained that edna had neglected her much of late
besides she was consumed with curiosity to see the little house and the manner in which it was conducted
she wanted to hear all about the dinner party monsieur ratignolle had left so early
what had happened after he left
the champagne and grapes which edna sent over were too delicious
she had so little appetite they had refreshed and toned her stomach
where on earth was she going to put mr pontellier in that little house and the boys
and then she made edna promise to go to her when her hour of trial overtook her
at any timeany time of the day or night dear edna assured her
before leaving madame ratignolle said  in some way you seem to me like a child edna
you seem to act without a certain amount of reflection which is necessary in this life
that is the reason i want to say you mustn't mind if i advise you to be a little careful while you are living here alone
why don't you have some one come and stay with you
wouldn't mademoiselle reisz come  no she wouldn't wish to come and i shouldn't want her always with me  well the reasonyou know how evilminded the world issome one was talking of alcee arobin visiting you
of course it wouldn't matter if mr arobin had not such a dreadful reputation
monsieur ratignolle was telling me that his attentions alone are considered enough to ruin a woman's name  does he boast of his successes asked edna indifferently squinting at her picture
no i think not
i believe he is a decent fellow as far as that goes
but his character is so well known among the men
i shan't be able to come back and see you it was very very imprudent today  mind the step cried edna
don't neglect me entreated madame ratignolle and don't mind what i said about arobin or having some one to stay with you
of course not edna laughed
you may say anything you like to me  they kissed each other goodby
madame ratignolle had not far to go and edna stood on the porch a while watching her walk down the street
then in the afternoon mrs merriman and mrs highcamp had made their party call edna felt that they might have dispensed with the formality
they had also come to invite her to play vingtetun one evening at mrs merriman's
she was asked to go early to dinner and mr merriman or mr arobin would take her home
edna accepted in a halfhearted way
she sometimes felt very tired of mrs highcamp and mrs merriman
late in the afternoon she sought refuge with mademoiselle reisz and stayed there alone waiting for her feeling a kind of repose invade her with the very atmosphere of the shabby unpretentious little room
edna sat at the window which looked out over the housetops and across the river
the window frame was filled with pots of flowers and she sat and picked the dry leaves from a rose geranium
the day was warm and the breeze which blew from the river was very pleasant
she removed her hat and laid it on the piano
she went on picking the leaves and digging around the plants with her hat pin
once she thought she heard mademoiselle reisz approaching
but it was a young black girl who came in bringing a small bundle of laundry which she deposited in the adjoining room and went away
edna seated herself at the piano and softly picked out with one hand the bars of a piece of music which lay open before her
a halfhour went by
there was the occasional sound of people going and coming in the lower hall
she was growing interested in her occupation of picking out the aria when there was a second rap at the door
she vaguely wondered what these people did when they found mademoiselle's door locked
come in she called turning her face toward the door
and this time it was robert lebrun who presented himself
she attempted to rise she could not have done so without betraying the agitation which mastered her at sight of him so she fell back upon the stool only exclaiming why robert  he came and clasped her hand seemingly without knowing what he was saying or doing
mrs
pontellier
how do you happenoh
how well you look
is mademoiselle reisz not here
i never expected to see you  when did you come back asked edna in an unsteady voice wiping her face with her handkerchief
she seemed ill at ease on the piano stool and he begged her to take the chair by the window
she did so mechanically while he seated himself on the stool
i returned day before yesterday he answered while he leaned his arm on the keys bringing forth a crash of discordant sound
day before yesterday she repeated aloud and went on thinking to herself day before yesterday in a sort of an uncomprehending way
she had pictured him seeking her at the very first hour and he had lived under the same sky since day before yesterday while only by accident had he stumbled upon her
mademoiselle must have lied when she said poor fool he loves you  day before yesterday she repeated breaking off a spray of mademoiselle's geranium then if you had not met me here today you wouldn'twhenthat is didn't you mean to come and see me  of course i should have gone to see you
there have been so many things he turned the leaves of mademoiselle's music nervously
i started in at once yesterday with the old firm
after all there is as much chance for me here as there was therethat is i might find it profitable some day
the mexicans were not very congenial  so he had come back because the mexicans were not congenial because business was as profitable here as there because of any reason and not because he cared to be near her
she remembered the day she sat on the floor turning the pages of his letter seeking the reason which was left untold
she had not noticed how he lookedonly feeling his presence but she turned deliberately and observed him
after all he had been absent but a few months and was not changed
his hairthe color of herswaved back from his temples in the same way as before
his skin was not more burned than it had been at grand isle
she found in his eyes when he looked at her for one silent moment the same tender caress with an added warmth and entreaty which had not been there before the same glance which had penetrated to the sleeping places of her soul and awakened them
a hundred times edna had pictured robert's return and imagined their first meeting
it was usually at her home whither he had sought her out at once
she always fancied him expressing or betraying in some way his love for her
and here the reality was that they sat ten feet apart she at the window crushing geranium leaves in her hand and smelling them he twirling around on the piano stool saying  i was very much surprised to hear of mr pontellier's absence it's a wonder mademoiselle reisz did not tell me and your movingmother told me yesterday
i should think you would have gone to new york with him or to iberville with the children rather than be bothered here with housekeeping
and you are going abroad too i hear
we shan't have you at grand isle next summer it won't seemdo you see much of mademoiselle reisz
she often spoke of you in the few letters she wrote  do you remember that you promised to write to me when you went away a flush overspread his whole face
i couldn't believe that my letters would be of any interest to you  that is an excuse it isn't the truth edna reached for her hat on the piano
she adjusted it sticking the hat pin through the heavy coil of hair with some deliberation
are you not going to wait for mademoiselle reisz asked robert
no i have found when she is absent this long she is liable not to come back till late she drew on her gloves and robert picked up his hat
won't you wait for her asked edna
not if you think she will not be back till late adding as if suddenly aware of some discourtesy in his speech and i should miss the pleasure of walking home with you edna locked the door and put the key back in its hidingplace
they went together picking their way across muddy streets and sidewalks encumbered with the cheap display of small tradesmen
part of the distance they rode in the car and after disembarking passed the pontellier mansion which looked broken and half torn asunder
robert had never known the house and looked at it with interest
i never knew you in your home he remarked
i am glad you did not  why she did not answer
they went on around the corner and it seemed as if her dreams were coming true after all when he followed her into the little house
you must stay and dine with me robert
you see i am all alone and it is so long since i have seen you
there is so much i want to ask you  she took off her hat and gloves
he stood irresolute making some excuse about his mother who expected him he even muttered something about an engagement
she struck a match and lit the lamp on the table it was growing dusk
when he saw her face in the lamplight looking pained with all the soft lines gone out of it he threw his hat aside and seated himself
oh
you know i want to stay if you will let me he exclaimed
all the softness came back
she laughed and went and put her hand on his shoulder
this is the first moment you have seemed like the old robert
i'll go tell celestine she hurried away to tell celestine to set an extra place
she even sent her off in search of some added delicacy which she had not thought of for herself
and she recommended great care in dripping the coffee and having the omelet done to a proper turn
when she reentered robert was turning over magazines sketches and things that lay upon the table in great disorder
he picked up a photograph and exclaimed  alcee arobin
what on earth is his picture doing here  i tried to make a sketch of his head one day answered edna and he thought the photograph might help me
it was at the other house
i thought it had been left there
i must have packed it up with my drawing materials  i should think you would give it back to him if you have finished with it  oh
i have a great many such photographs
i never think of returning them
they don't amount to anything robert kept on looking at the picture
it seems to medo you think his head worth drawing
is he a friend of mr pontellier's
you never said you knew him  he isn't a friend of mr pontellier's he's a friend of mine
i always knew himthat is it is only of late that i know him pretty well
but i'd rather talk about you and know what you have been seeing and doing and feeling out there in mexico robert threw aside the picture
i've been seeing the waves and the white beach of grand isle the quiet grassy street of the cheniere the old fort at grande terre
i've been working like a machine and feeling like a lost soul
there was nothing interesting  she leaned her head upon her hand to shade her eyes from the light
and what have you been seeing and doing and feeling all these days he asked
i've been seeing the waves and the white beach of grand isle the quiet grassy street of the cheniere caminada the old sunny fort at grande terre
i've been working with a little more comprehension than a machine and still feeling like a lost soul
there was nothing interesting  mrs
pontellier you are cruel he said with feeling closing his eyes and resting his head back in his chair
they remained in silence till old celestine announced dinner
xxxiv   the diningroom was very small
edna's round mahogany would have almost filled it
as it was there was but a step or two from the little table to the kitchen to the mantel the small buffet and the side door that opened out on the narrow brickpaved yard
a certain degree of ceremony settled upon them with the announcement of dinner
there was no return to personalities
robert related incidents of his sojourn in mexico and edna talked of events likely to interest him which had occurred during his absence
the dinner was of ordinary quality except for the few delicacies which she had sent out to purchase
old celestine with a bandana tignon twisted about her head hobbled in and out taking a personal interest in everything and she lingered occasionally to talk patois with robert whom she had known as a boy
he went out to a neighboring cigar stand to purchase cigarette papers and when he came back he found that celestine had served the black coffee in the parlor
perhaps i shouldn't have come back he said
when you are tired of me tell me to go  you never tire me
you must have forgotten the hours and hours at grand isle in which we grew accustomed to each other and used to being together  i have forgotten nothing at grand isle he said not looking at her but rolling a cigarette
his tobacco pouch which he laid upon the table was a fantastic embroidered silk affair evidently the handiwork of a woman
you used to carry your tobacco in a rubber pouch said edna picking up the pouch and examining the needlework
yes it was lost  where did you buy this one
in mexico  it was given to me by a vera cruz girl they are very generous he replied striking a match and lighting his cigarette
they are very handsome i suppose those mexican women very picturesque with their black eyes and their lace scarfs  some are others are hideous just as you find women everywhere  what was she likethe one who gave you the pouch
you must have known her very well  she was very ordinary
she wasn't of the slightest importance
i knew her well enough  did you visit at her house
was it interesting
i should like to know and hear about the people you met and the impressions they made on you  there are some people who leave impressions not so lasting as the imprint of an oar upon the water  was she such a one  it would be ungenerous for me to admit that she was of that order and kind he thrust the pouch back in his pocket as if to put away the subject with the trifle which had brought it up
arobin dropped in with a message from mrs merriman to say that the card party was postponed on account of the illness of one of her children
how do you do arobin said robert rising from the obscurity
oh
lebrun
to be sure
i heard yesterday you were back
how did they treat you down in mexique  fairly well  but not well enough to keep you there
stunning girls though in mexico
i thought i should never get away from vera cruz when i was down there a couple of years ago  did they embroider slippers and tobacco pouches and hatbands and things for you asked edna
oh
my
no
i didn't get so deep in their regard
i fear they made more impression on me than i made on them  you were less fortunate than robert then  i am always less fortunate than robert
has he been imparting tender confidences  i've been imposing myself long enough said robert rising and shaking hands with edna
please convey my regards to mr pontellier when you write  he shook hands with arobin and went away
fine fellow that lebrun said arobin when robert had gone
i never heard you speak of him  i knew him last summer at grand isle she replied
here is that photograph of yours
don't you want it  what do i want with it
throw it away she threw it back on the table
i'm not going to mrs merriman's she said
if you see her tell her so
but perhaps i had better write
i think i shall write now and say that i am sorry her child is sick and tell her not to count on me  it would be a good scheme acquiesced arobin
i don't blame you stupid lot  edna opened the blotter and having procured paper and pen began to write the note
arobin lit a cigar and read the evening paper which he had in his pocket
what is the date she asked
he told her
will you mail this for me when you go out  certainly he read to her little bits out of the newspaper while she straightened things on the table
what do you want to do he asked throwing aside the paper
do you want to go out for a walk or a drive or anything
it would be a fine night to drive  no i don't want to do anything but just be quiet
you go away and amuse yourself
don't stay  i'll go away if i must but i shan't amuse myself
you know that i only live when i am near you  he stood up to bid her good night
is that one of the things you always say to women  i have said it before but i don't think i ever came so near meaning it he answered with a smile
there were no warm lights in her eyes only a dreamy absent look
good night
i adore you
sleep well he said and he kissed her hand and went away
she stayed alone in a kind of reveriea sort of stupor
step by step she lived over every instant of the time she had been with robert after he had entered mademoiselle reisz's door
she recalled his words his looks
how few and meager they had been for her hungry heart
a visiona transcendently seductive vision of a mexican girl arose before her
she writhed with a jealous pang
she wondered when he would come back
he had not said he would come back
she had been with him had heard his voice and touched his hand
but some way he had seemed nearer to her off there in mexico
xxxv   the morning was full of sunlight and hope
edna could see before her no denialonly the promise of excessive joy
she lay in bed awake with bright eyes full of speculation
he loves you poor fool if she could but get that conviction firmly fixed in her mind what mattered about the rest
she felt she had been childish and unwise the night before in giving herself over to despondency
she recapitulated the motives which no doubt explained robert's reserve
they were not insurmountable they would not hold if he really loved her they could not hold against her own passion which he must come to realize in time
she pictured him going to his business that morning
she even saw how he was dressed how he walked down one street and turned the corner of another saw him bending over his desk talking to people who entered the office going to his lunch and perhaps watching for her on the street
he would come to her in the afternoon or evening sit and roll his cigarette talk a little and go away as he had done the night before
but how delicious it would be to have him there with her
she would have no regrets nor seek to penetrate his reserve if he still chose to wear it
edna ate her breakfast only half dressed
the maid brought her a delicious printed scrawl from raoul expressing his love asking her to send him some bonbons and telling her they had found that morning ten tiny white pigs all lying in a row beside lidie's big white pig
a letter also came from her husband saying he hoped to be back early in march and then they would get ready for that journey abroad which he had promised her so long which he felt now fully able to afford he felt able to travel as people should without any thought of small economiesthanks to his recent speculations in wall street
much to her surprise she received a note from arobin written at midnight from the club
it was to say good morning to her to hope she had slept well to assure her of his devotion which he trusted she in some faintest manner returned
all these letters were pleasing to her
she answered the children in a cheerful frame of mind promising them bonbons and congratulating them upon their happy find of the little pigs
she answered her husband with friendly evasivenessnot with any fixed design to mislead him only because all sense of reality had gone out of her life she had abandoned herself to fate and awaited the consequences with indifference
to arobin's note she made no reply
she put it under celestine's stovelid
edna worked several hours with much spirit
she saw no one but a picture dealer who asked her if it were true that she was going abroad to study in paris
she said possibly she might and he negotiated with her for some parisian studies to reach him in time for the holiday trade in december
robert did not come that day
she was keenly disappointed
he did not come the following day nor the next
each morning she awoke with hope and each night she was a prey to despondency
she was tempted to seek him out
but far from yielding to the impulse she avoided any occasion which might throw her in his way
she did not go to mademoiselle reisz's nor pass by madame lebrun's as she might have done if he had still been in mexico
when arobin one night urged her to drive with him she wentout to the lake on the shell road
his horses were full of mettle and even a little unmanageable
she liked the rapid gait at which they spun along and the quick sharp sound of the horses' hoofs on the hard road
they did not stop anywhere to eat or to drink
arobin was not needlessly imprudent
but they ate and they drank when they regained edna's little diningroomwhich was comparatively early in the evening
it was late when he left her
it was getting to be more than a passing whim with arobin to see her and be with her
he had detected the latent sensuality which unfolded under his delicate sense of her nature's requirements like a torpid torrid sensitive blossom
there was no despondency when she fell asleep that night nor was there hope when she awoke in the morning
xxxvi   there was a garden out in the suburbs a small leafy corner with a few green tables under the orange trees
an old cat slept all day on the stone step in the sun and an old mulatresse slept her idle hours away in her chair at the open window till some one happened to knock on one of the green tables
she had milk and cream cheese to sell and bread and butter
there was no one who could make such excellent coffee or fry a chicken so golden brown as she
the place was too modest to attract the attention of people of fashion and so quiet as to have escaped the notice of those in search of pleasure and dissipation
edna had discovered it accidentally one day when the highboard gate stood ajar
she caught sight of a little green table blotched with the checkered sunlight that filtered through the quivering leaves overhead
within she had found the slumbering mulatresse the drowsy cat and a glass of milk which reminded her of the milk she had tasted in iberville
she often stopped there during her perambulations sometimes taking a book with her and sitting an hour or two under the trees when she found the place deserted
once or twice she took a quiet dinner there alone having instructed celestine beforehand to prepare no dinner at home
it was the last place in the city where she would have expected to meet any one she knew
still she was not astonished when as she was partaking of a modest dinner late in the afternoon looking into an open book stroking the cat which had made friends with hershe was not greatly astonished to see robert come in at the tall garden gate
i am destined to see you only by accident she said shoving the cat off the chair beside her
he was surprised ill at ease almost embarrassed at meeting her thus so unexpectedly
do you come here often he asked
i almost live here she said
i used to drop in very often for a cup of catiche's good coffee
this is the first time since i came back  she'll bring you a plate and you will share my dinner
there's always enough for twoeven three edna had intended to be indifferent and as reserved as he when she met him she had reached the determination by a laborious train of reasoning incident to one of her despondent moods
but her resolve melted when she saw him before designing providence had led him into her path
why have you kept away from me robert she asked closing the book that lay open upon the table
why are you so personal mrs pontellier
why do you force me to idiotic subterfuges he exclaimed with sudden warmth
i suppose there's no use telling you i've been very busy or that i've been sick or that i've been to see you and not found you at home
please let me off with any one of these excuses  you are the embodiment of selfishness she said
you save yourself somethingi don't know whatbut there is some selfish motive and in sparing yourself you never consider for a moment what i think or how i feel your neglect and indifference
i suppose this is what you would call unwomanly but i have got into a habit of expressing myself
it doesn't matter to me and you may think me unwomanly if you like  no i only think you cruel as i said the other day
maybe not intentionally cruel but you seem to be forcing me into disclosures which can result in nothing as if you would have me bare a wound for the pleasure of looking at it without the intention or power of healing it  i'm spoiling your dinner robert never mind what i say
you haven't eaten a morsel  i only came in for a cup of coffee his sensitive face was all disfigured with excitement
isn't this a delightful place she remarked
i am so glad it has never actually been discovered
it is so quiet so sweet here
do you notice there is scarcely a sound to be heard
it's so out of the way and a good walk from the car
however i don't mind walking
i always feel so sorry for women who don't like to walk they miss so muchso many rare little glimpses of life and we women learn so little of life on the whole
catiche's coffee is always hot
i don't know how she manages it here in the open air
celestine's coffee gets cold bringing it from the kitchen to the diningroom
three lumps
how can you drink it so sweet
take some of the cress with your chop it's so biting and crisp
then there's the advantage of being able to smoke with your coffee out here
now in the cityaren't you going to smoke  after a while he said laying a cigar on the table
who gave it to you she laughed
i bought it
i suppose i'm getting reckless i bought a whole box she was determined not to be personal again and make him uncomfortable
the cat made friends with him and climbed into his lap when he smoked his cigar
he stroked her silky fur and talked a little about her
he looked at edna's book which he had read and he told her the end to save her the trouble of wading through it he said
again he accompanied her back to her home and it was after dusk when they reached the little pigeonhouse she did not ask him to remain which he was grateful for as it permitted him to stay without the discomfort of blundering through an excuse which he had no intention of considering
he helped her to light the lamp then she went into her room to take off her hat and to bathe her face and hands
when she came back robert was not examining the pictures and magazines as before he sat off in the shadow leaning his head back on the chair as if in a reverie
edna lingered a moment beside the table arranging the books there
then she went across the room to where he sat
she bent over the arm of his chair and called his name
robert she said are you asleep  no he answered looking up at her
she leaned over and kissed hima soft cool delicate kiss whose voluptuous sting penetrated his whole beingthen she moved away from him
he followed and took her in his arms just holding her close to him
she put her hand up to his face and pressed his cheek against her own
the action was full of love and tenderness
he sought her lips again
then he drew her down upon the sofa beside him and held her hand in both of his
now you know he said now you know what i have been fighting against since last summer at grand isle what drove me away and drove me back again  why have you been fighting against it she asked
her face glowed with soft lights
why
because you were not free you were leonce pontellier's wife
i couldn't help loving you if you were ten times his wife but so long as i went away from you and kept away i could help telling you so she put her free hand up to his shoulder and then against his cheek rubbing it softly
he kissed her again
his face was warm and flushed
there in mexico i was thinking of you all the time and longing for you  but not writing to me she interrupted
something put into my head that you cared for me and i lost my senses
i forgot everything but a wild dream of your some way becoming my wife  your wife  religion loyalty everything would give way if only you cared  then you must have forgotten that i was leonce pontellier's wife  oh
i was demented dreaming of wild impossible things recalling men who had set their wives free we have heard of such things  yes we have heard of such things  i came back full of vague mad intentions
and when i got here  when you got here you never came near me she was still caressing his cheek
i realized what a cur i was to dream of such a thing even if you had been willing  she took his face between her hands and looked into it as if she would never withdraw her eyes more
she kissed him on the forehead the eyes the cheeks and the lips
you have been a very very foolish boy wasting your time dreaming of impossible things when you speak of mr pontellier setting me free
i am no longer one of mr pontellier's possessions to dispose of or not
i give myself where i choose
if he were to say 'here robert take her and be happy she is yours' i should laugh at you both  his face grew a little white
what do you mean he asked
there was a knock at the door
old celestine came in to say that madame ratignolle's servant had come around the back way with a message that madame had been taken sick and begged mrs pontellier to go to her immediately
yes yes said edna rising i promised
tell her yesto wait for me
i'll go back with her  let me walk over with you offered robert
no she said i will go with the servant she went into her room to put on her hat and when she came in again she sat once more upon the sofa beside him
he had not stirred
she put her arms about his neck
goodby my sweet robert
tell me goodby he kissed her with a degree of passion which had not before entered into his caress and strained her to him
i love you she whispered only you no one but you
it was you who awoke me last summer out of a lifelong stupid dream
oh
you have made me so unhappy with your indifference
oh
i have suffered suffered
now you are here we shall love each other my robert
we shall be everything to each other
nothing else in the world is of any consequence
i must go to my friend but you will wait for me
no matter how late you will wait for me robert  don't go don't go
oh
edna stay with me he pleaded
why should you go
stay with me stay with me  i shall come back as soon as i can i shall find you here she buried her face in his neck and said goodby again
her seductive voice together with his great love for her had enthralled his senses had deprived him of every impulse but the longing to hold her and keep her
xxxvii   edna looked in at the drug store
monsieur ratignolle was putting up a mixture himself very carefully dropping a red liquid into a tiny glass
he was grateful to edna for having come her presence would be a comfort to his wife
madame ratignolle's sister who had always been with her at such trying times had not been able to come up from the plantation and adele had been inconsolable until mrs pontellier so kindly promised to come to her
the nurse had been with them at night for the past week as she lived a great distance away
and dr mandelet had been coming and going all the afternoon
they were then looking for him any moment
edna hastened upstairs by a private stairway that led from the rear of the store to the apartments above
the children were all sleeping in a back room
madame ratignolle was in the salon whither she had strayed in her suffering impatience
she sat on the sofa clad in an ample white peignoir holding a handkerchief tight in her hand with a nervous clutch
her face was drawn and pinched her sweet blue eyes haggard and unnatural
all her beautiful hair had been drawn back and plaited
it lay in a long braid on the sofa pillow coiled like a golden serpent
the nurse a comfortable looking griffe woman in white apron and cap was urging her to return to her bedroom
there is no use there is no use she said at once to edna
we must get rid of mandelet he is getting too old and careless
he said he would be here at halfpast seven now it must be eight
see what time it is josephine  the woman was possessed of a cheerful nature and refused to take any situation too seriously especially a situation with which she was so familiar
she urged madame to have courage and patience
but madame only set her teeth hard into her under lip and edna saw the sweat gather in beads on her white forehead
after a moment or two she uttered a profound sigh and wiped her face with the handkerchief rolled in a ball
she appeared exhausted
the nurse gave her a fresh handkerchief sprinkled with cologne water
this is too much she cried
mandelet ought to be killed
where is alphonse
is it possible i am to be abandoned like thisneglected by every one  neglected indeed exclaimed the nurse
wasn't she there
and here was mrs pontellier leaving no doubt a pleasant evening at home to devote to her
and wasn't monsieur ratignolle coming that very instant through the hall
and josephine was quite sure she had heard doctor mandelet's coupe
yes there it was down at the door
adele consented to go back to her room
she sat on the edge of a little low couch next to her bed
doctor mandelet paid no attention to madame ratignolle's upbraidings
he was accustomed to them at such times and was too well convinced of her loyalty to doubt it
he was glad to see edna and wanted her to go with him into the salon and entertain him
but madame ratignolle would not consent that edna should leave her for an instant
between agonizing moments she chatted a little and said it took her mind off her sufferings
edna began to feel uneasy
she was seized with a vague dread
her own like experiences seemed far away unreal and only half remembered
she recalled faintly an ecstasy of pain the heavy odor of chloroform a stupor which had deadened sensation and an awakening to find a little new life to which she had given being added to the great unnumbered multitude of souls that come and go
she began to wish she had not come her presence was not necessary
she might have invented a pretext for staying away she might even invent a pretext now for going
but edna did not go
with an inward agony with a flaming outspoken revolt against the ways of nature she witnessed the scene of torture
she was still stunned and speechless with emotion when later she leaned over her friend to kiss her and softly say goodby
adele pressing her cheek whispered in an exhausted voice think of the children edna
oh think of the children
remember them     xxxviii   edna still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air
the doctor's coupe had returned for him and stood before the porte cochere
she did not wish to enter the coupe and told doctor mandelet she would walk she was not afraid and would go alone
he directed his carriage to meet him at mrs pontellier's and he started to walk home with her
upaway up over the narrow street between the tall houses the stars were blazing
the air was mild and caressing but cool with the breath of spring and the night
they walked slowly the doctor with a heavy measured tread and his hands behind him edna in an absentminded way as she had walked one night at grand isle as if her thoughts had gone ahead of her and she was striving to overtake them
you shouldn't have been there mrs pontellier he said
that was no place for you
adele is full of whims at such times
there were a dozen women she might have had with her unimpressionable women
i felt that it was cruel cruel
you shouldn't have gone  oh well she answered indifferently
i don't know that it matters after all
one has to think of the children some time or other the sooner the better  when is leonce coming back  quite soon
some time in march  and you are going abroad  perhapsno i am not going
i'm not going to be forced into doing things
i don't want to go abroad
i want to be let alone
nobody has any rightexcept children perhapsand even then it seems to meor it did seem she felt that her speech was voicing the incoherency of her thoughts and stopped abruptly
the trouble is sighed the doctor grasping her meaning intuitively that youth is given up to illusions
it seems to be a provision of nature a decoy to secure mothers for the race
and nature takes no account of moral consequences of arbitrary conditions which we create and which we feel obliged to maintain at any cost  yes she said
the years that are gone seem like dreamsif one might go on sleeping and dreamingbut to wake up and findoh
well
perhaps it is better to wake up after all even to suffer rather than to remain a dupe to illusions all one's life  it seems to me my dear child said the doctor at parting holding her hand you seem to me to be in trouble
i am not going to ask for your confidence
i will only say that if ever you feel moved to give it to me perhaps i might help you
i know i would understand
and i tell you there are not many who wouldnot many my dear  some way i don't feel moved to speak of things that trouble me
don't think i am ungrateful or that i don't appreciate your sympathy
there are periods of despondency and suffering which take possession of me
but i don't want anything but my own way
that is wanting a good deal of course when you have to trample upon the lives the hearts the prejudices of othersbut no matterstill i shouldn't want to trample upon the little lives
oh
i don't know what i'm saying doctor
good night
don't blame me for anything  yes i will blame you if you don't come and see me soon
we will talk of things you never have dreamt of talking about before
it will do us both good
i don't want you to blame yourself whatever comes
good night my child  she let herself in at the gate but instead of entering she sat upon the step of the porch
the night was quiet and soothing
all the tearing emotion of the last few hours seemed to fall away from her like a somber uncomfortable garment which she had but to loosen to be rid of
she went back to that hour before adele had sent for her and her senses kindled afresh in thinking of robert's words the pressure of his arms and the feeling of his lips upon her own
she could picture at that moment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one
his expression of love had already given him to her in part
when she thought that he was there at hand waiting for her she grew numb with the intoxication of expectancy
it was so late he would be asleep perhaps
she would awaken him with a kiss
she hoped he would be asleep that she might arouse him with her caresses
still she remembered adele's voice whispering think of the children think of them she meant to think of them that determination had driven into her soul like a death woundbut not tonight
tomorrow would be time to think of everything
robert was not waiting for her in the little parlor
he was nowhere at hand
the house was empty
but he had scrawled on a piece of paper that lay in the lamplight  i love you
goodbybecause i love you  edna grew faint when she read the words
she went and sat on the sofa
then she stretched herself out there never uttering a sound
she did not sleep
she did not go to bed
the lamp sputtered and went out
she was still awake in the morning when celestine unlocked the kitchen door and came in to light the fire
xxxix   victor with hammer and nails and scraps of scantling was patching a corner of one of the galleries
mariequita sat near by dangling her legs watching him work and handing him nails from the toolbox
the sun was beating down upon them
the girl had covered her head with her apron folded into a square pad
they had been talking for an hour or more
she was never tired of hearing victor describe the dinner at mrs pontellier's
he exaggerated every detail making it appear a veritable lucullean feast
the flowers were in tubs he said
the champagne was quaffed from huge golden goblets
venus rising from the foam could have presented no more entrancing a spectacle than mrs pontellier blazing with beauty and diamonds at the head of the board while the other women were all of them youthful houris possessed of incomparable charms
she got it into her head that victor was in love with mrs pontellier and he gave her evasive answers framed so as to confirm her belief
she grew sullen and cried a little threatening to go off and leave him to his fine ladies
there were a dozen men crazy about her at the cheniere and since it was the fashion to be in love with married people why she could run away any time she liked to new orleans with celina's husband
celina's husband was a fool a coward and a pig and to prove it to her victor intended to hammer his head into a jelly the next time he encountered him
this assurance was very consoling to mariequita
she dried her eyes and grew cheerful at the prospect
they were still talking of the dinner and the allurements of city life when mrs pontellier herself slipped around the corner of the house
the two youngsters stayed dumb with amazement before what they considered to be an apparition
but it was really she in flesh and blood looking tired and a little travelstained
i walked up from the wharf she said and heard the hammering
i supposed it was you mending the porch
it's a good thing
i was always tripping over those loose planks last summer
how dreary and deserted everything looks  it took victor some little time to comprehend that she had come in beaudelet's lugger that she had come alone and for no purpose but to rest
there's nothing fixed up yet you see
i'll give you my room it's the only place  any corner will do she assured him
and if you can stand philomel's cooking he went on though i might try to get her mother while you are here
do you think she would come  turning to mariequita
mariequita thought that perhaps philomel's mother might come for a few days and money enough
beholding mrs pontellier make her appearance the girl had at once suspected a lovers' rendezvous
but victor's astonishment was so genuine and mrs pontellier's indifference so apparent that the disturbing notion did not lodge long in her brain
she contemplated with the greatest interest this woman who gave the most sumptuous dinners in america and who had all the men in new orleans at her feet
what time will you have dinner asked edna
i'm very hungry but don't get anything extra  i'll have it ready in little or no time he said bustling and packing away his tools
you may go to my room to brush up and rest yourself
mariequita will show you  thank you said edna
but do you know i have a notion to go down to the beach and take a good wash and even a little swim before dinner  the water is too cold they both exclaimed
don't think of it  well i might go down and trydip my toes in
why it seems to me the sun is hot enough to have warmed the very depths of the ocean
could you get me a couple of towels
i'd better go right away so as to be back in time
it would be a little too chilly if i waited till this afternoon  mariequita ran over to victor's room and returned with some towels which she gave to edna
i hope you have fish for dinner said edna as she started to walk away but don't do anything extra if you haven't  run and find philomel's mother victor instructed the girl
i'll go to the kitchen and see what i can do
by gimminy
women have no consideration
she might have sent me word  edna walked on down to the beach rather mechanically not noticing anything special except that the sun was hot
she was not dwelling upon any particular train of thought
she had done all the thinking which was necessary after robert went away when she lay awake upon the sofa till morning
she had said over and over to herself today it is arobin tomorrow it will be some one else
it makes no difference to me it doesn't matter about leonce pontellierbut raoul and etienne she understood now clearly what she had meant long ago when she said to adele ratignolle that she would give up the unessential but she would never sacrifice herself for her children
despondency had come upon her there in the wakeful night and had never lifted
there was no one thing in the world that she desired
there was no human being whom she wanted near her except robert and she even realized that the day would come when he too and the thought of him would melt out of her existence leaving her alone
the children appeared before her like antagonists who had overcome her who had overpowered and sought to drag her into the soul's slavery for the rest of her days
but she knew a way to elude them
she was not thinking of these things when she walked down to the beach
the water of the gulf stretched out before her gleaming with the million lights of the sun
the voice of the sea is seductive never ceasing whispering clamoring murmuring inviting the soul to wander in abysses of solitude
all along the white beach up and down there was no living thing in sight
a bird with a broken wing was beating the air above reeling fluttering circling disabled down down to the water
edna had found her old bathing suit still hanging faded upon its accustomed peg
she put it on leaving her clothing in the bathhouse
but when she was there beside the sea absolutely alone she cast the unpleasant pricking garments from her and for the first time in her life she stood naked in the open air at the mercy of the sun the breeze that beat upon her and the waves that invited her
how strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky
how delicious
she felt like some newborn creature opening its eyes in a familiar world that it had never known
the foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet and coiled like serpents about her ankles
she walked out
the water was chill but she walked on
the water was deep but she lifted her white body and reached out with a long sweeping stroke
the touch of the sea is sensuous enfolding the body in its soft close embrace
she went on and on
she remembered the night she swam far out and recalled the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to regain the shore
she did not look back now but went on and on thinking of the bluegrass meadow that she had traversed when a little child believing that it had no beginning and no end
her arms and legs were growing tired
she thought of leonce and the children
they were a part of her life
but they need not have thought that they could possess her body and soul
how mademoiselle reisz would have laughed perhaps sneered if she knew
and you call yourself an artist
what pretensions madame
the artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies  exhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her
goodbybecause i love you he did not know he did not understand
he would never understand
perhaps doctor mandelet would have understood if she had seen himbut it was too late the shore was far behind her and her strength was gone
she looked into the distance and the old terror flamed up for an instant then sank again
edna heard her father's voice and her sister margaret's
she heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the sycamore tree
the spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked across the porch
there was the hum of bees and the musky odor of pinks filled the air
