may thi love my garden
i am writing in it now in the late afternoon loveliness much interrupted by the mosquitoes and the temptation to look at all the glories of the new green leaves washed half an hour ago in a cold shower
two owls are perched near me and are carrying on a long conversation that i enjoy as much as any warbling of nightingales
the gentleman owl says musical notes occur here in the printed text and she answers from her tree a little way off musical notes beautifully assenting to and completing her lords remark as becomes a properly constructed german sheowl
they say the same thing over and over again so emphatically that i think it must be something nasty about me but i shall not let myself be frightened away by the sarcasm of owls
this is less a garden than a wilderness
no one has lived in the house much less in the garden for twentyfive years and it is such a pretty old place that the people who might have lived here and did not deliberately preferring the horrors of a flat in a town must have belonged to that vast number of eyeless and earless persons of whom the world seems chiefly composed
noseless too though it does not sound pretty but the greater part of my spring happiness is due to the scent of the wet earth and young leaves
i am always happy out of doors be it understood for indoors there are servants and furniture but in quite different ways and my spring happiness bears no resemblance to my summer or autumn happiness though it is not more intense and there were days last winter when i danced for sheer joy out in my frostbound garden in spite of my years and children
but i did it behind a bush having a due regard for the decencies
there are so many birdcherries round me great trees with branches sweeping the grass and they are so wreathed just now with white blossoms and tenderest green that the garden looks like a wedding
i never saw such masses of them they seemed to fill the place
even across a little stream that bounds the garden on the east and right in the middle of the cornfield beyond there is an immense one a picture of grace and glory against the cold blue of the spring sky
my garden is surrounded by cornfields and meadows and beyond are great stretches of sandy heath and pine forests and where the forests leave off the bare heath begins again but the forests are beautiful in their lofty pinkstemmed vastness far overhead the crowns of softest graygreen and underfoot a bright green wortleberry carpet and everywhere the breathless silence and the bare heaths are beautiful too for one can see across them into eternity almost and to go out on to them with ones face towards the setting sun is like going into the very presence of god
in the middle of this plain is the oasis of birdcherries and greenery where i spend my happy days and in the middle of the oasis is the gray stone house with many gables where i pass my reluctant nights
the house is very old and has been added to at various times
it was a convent before the thirty years war and the vaulted chapel with its brick floor worn by pious peasant knees is now used as a hall
gustavus adolphus and his swedes passed through more than once as is duly recorded in archives still preserved for we are on what was then the highroad between sweden and brandenburg the unfortunate
the lion of the north was no doubt an estimable person and acted wholly up to his convictions but he must have sadly upset the peaceful nuns who were not without convictions of their own sending them out on to the wide empty plain to piteously seek some life to replace the life of silence here
from nearly all the windows of the house i can look out across the plain with no obstacle in the shape of a hill right away to a blue line of distant forest and on the west side uninterruptedly to the setting sunnothing but a green rolling plain with a sharp edge against the sunset
i love those west windows better than any others and have chosen my bedroom on that side of the house so that even times of hairbrushing may not be entirely lost and the young woman who attends to such matters has been taught to fulfil her duties about a mistress recumbent in an easychair before an open window and not to profane with chatter that sweet and solemn time
this girl is grieved at my habit of living almost in the garden and all her ideas as to the sort of life a respectable german lady should lead have got into a sad muddle since she came to me
the people round about are persuaded that i am to put it as kindly as possible exceedingly eccentric for the news has travelled that i spend the day out of doors with a book and that no mortal eye has ever yet seen me sew or cook
but why cook when you can get some one to cook for you
and as for sewing the maids will hem the sheets better and quicker than i could and all forms of needlework of the fancy order are inventions of the evil one for keeping the foolish from applying their heart to wisdom
we had been married five years before it struck us that we might as well make use of this place by coming down and living in it
those five years were spent in a flat in a town and during their whole interminable length i was perfectly miserable and perfectly healthy which disposes of the ugly notion that has at times disturbed me that my happiness here is less due to the garden than to a good digestion
and while we were wasting our lives there here was this dear place with dandelions up to the very door all the paths grassgrown and completely effaced in winter so lonely with nobody but the north wind taking the least notice of it and in mayin all those five lovely maysno one to look at the wonderful birdcherries and still more wonderful masses of lilacs everything glowing and blowing the virginia creeper madder every year until at last in october the very roof was wreathed with bloodred tresses the owls and the squirrels and all the blessed little birds reigning supreme and not a living creature ever entering the empty house except the snakes which got into the habit during those silent years of wriggling up the south wall into the rooms on that side whenever the old housekeeper opened the windows
all that was herepeace and happiness and a reasonable lifeand yet it never struck me to come and live in it
looking back i am astonished and can in no way account for the tardiness of my discovery that here in this faraway corner was my kingdom of heaven
indeed so little did it enter my head to even use the place in summer that i submitted to weeks of seaside life with all its horrors every year until at last in the early spring of last year having come down for the opening of the village school and wandering out afterwards into the bare and desolate garden i dont know what smell of wet earth or rotting leaves brought back my childhood with a rush and all the happy days i had spent in a garden
shall i ever forget that day
it was the beginning of my real life my coming of age as it were and entering into my kingdom
early march gray quiet skies and brown quiet earth leafless and sad and lonely enough out there in the damp and silence yet there i stood feeling the same rapture of pure delight in the first breath of spring that i used to as a child and the five wasted years fell from me like a cloak and the world was full of hope and i vowed myself then and there to nature and have been happy ever since
my other half being indulgent and with some faint thought perhaps that it might be as well to look after the place consented to live in it at any rate for a time whereupon followed six specially blissful weeks from the end of april into june during which i was here alone supposed to be superintending the painting and papering but as a matter of fact only going into the house when the workmen had gone out of it
how happy i was
i dont remember any time quite so perfect since the days when i was too little to do lessons and was turned out with sugar on my eleven oclock bread and butter on to a lawn closely strewn with dandelions and daisies
the sugar on the bread and butter has lost its charm but i love the dandelions and daisies even more passionately now than then and never would endure to see them all mown away if i were not certain that in a day or two they would be pushing up their little faces again as jauntily as ever
during those six weeks i lived in a world of dandelions and delights
the dandelions carpeted the three lawnsthey used to be lawns but have long since blossomed out into meadows filled with every sort of pretty weedand under and among the groups of leafless oaks and beeches were blue hepaticas white anemones violets and celandines in sheets
the celandines in particular delighted me with their clean happy brightness so beautifully trim and newly varnished as though they too had had the painters at work on them
then when the anemones went came a few stray periwinkles and solomons seal and all the birdcherries blossomed in a burst
and then before i had a little got used to the joy of their flowers against the sky came the lilacsmasses and masses of them in clumps on the grass with other shrubs and trees by the side of walks and one great continuous bank of them half a mile long right past the west front of the house away down as far as one could see shining glorious against a background of firs
when that time came and when before it was over the acacias all blossomed too and four great clumps of pale silverypink peonies flowered under the south windows i felt so absolutely happy and blest and thankful and grateful that i really cannot describe it
my days seemed to melt away in a dream of pink and purple peace
there were only the old housekeeper and her handmaiden in the house so that on the plea of not giving too much trouble i could indulge what my other half calls my fantaisie dereglee as regards mealsthat is to say meals so simple that they could be brought out to the lilacs on a tray and i lived i remember on salad and bread and tea the whole time sometimes a very tiny pigeon appearing at lunch to save me as the old lady thought from starvation
who but a woman could have stood salad for six weeks even salad sanctified by the presence and scent of the most gorgeous lilac masses
i did and grew in grace every day though i have never liked it since
how often now oppressed by the necessity of assisting at three diningroom meals daily two of which are conducted by the functionaries held indispensable to a proper maintenance of the family dignity and all of which are pervaded by joints of meat how often do i think of my salad days forty in number and of the blessedness of being alone as i was then alone
and then the evenings when the workmen had all gone and the house was left to emptiness and echoes and the old housekeeper had gathered up her rheumatic limbs into her bed and my little room in quite another part of the house had been set ready how reluctantly i used to leave the friendly frogs and owls and with my heart somewhere down in my shoes lock the door to the garden behind me and pass through the long series of echoing south rooms full of shadows and ladders and ghostly pails of painters mess and humming a tune to make myself believe i liked it go rather slowly across the brickfloored hall up the creaking stairs down the long whitewashed passage and with a final rush of panic whisk into my room and double lock and bolt the door
there were no bells in the house and i used to take a great dinnerbell to bed with me so that at least i might be able to make a noise if frightened in the night though what good it would have been i dont know as there was no one to hear
the housemaid slept in another little cell opening out of mine and we two were the only living creatures in the great empty west wing
she evidently did not believe in ghosts for i could hear how she fell asleep immediately after getting into bed nor do i believe in them mais je les redoute as a french lady said who from her books appears to have been strongminded
the dinnerbell was a great solace it was never rung but it comforted me to see it on the chair beside my bed as my nights were anything but placid it was all so strange and there were such queer creakings and other noises
i used to lie awake for hours startled out of a light sleep by the cracking of some board and listen to the indifferent snores of the girl in the next room
in the morning of course i was as brave as a lion and much amused at the cold perspirations of the night before but even the nights seem to me now to have been delightful and myself like those historic boys who heard a voice in every wind and snatched a fearful joy
i would gladly shiver through them all over again for the sake of the beautiful purity of the house empty of servants and upholstery
how pretty the bedrooms looked with nothing in them but their cheerful new papers
sometimes i would go into those that were finished and build all sorts of castles in the air about their future and their past
would the nuns who had lived in them know their little whitewashed cells again all gay with delicate flower papers and clean white paint
and how astonished they would be to see cell no
 turned into a bathroom with a bath big enough to insure a cleanliness of body equal to their purity of soul
they would look upon it as a snare of the tempter and i know that in my own case i only began to be shocked at the blackness of my nails the day that i began to lose the first whiteness of my soul by falling in love at fifteen with the parish organist or rather with the glimpse of surplice and roman nose and fiery moustache which was all i ever saw of him and which i loved to distraction for at least six months at the end of which time going out with my governess one day i passed him in the street and discovered that his unofficial garb was a frockcoat combined with a turndown collar and a bowler hat and never loved him any more
the first part of that time of blessedness was the most perfect for i had not a thought of anything but the peace and beauty all round me
then he appeared suddenly who has a right to appear when and how he will and rebuked me for never having written and when i told him that i had been literally too happy to think of writing he seemed to take it as a reflection on himself that i could be happy alone
i took him round the garden along the new paths i had had made and showed him the acacia and lilac glories and he said that it was the purest selfishness to enjoy myself when neither he nor the offspring were with me and that the lilacs wanted thoroughly pruning
i tried to appease him by offering him the whole of my salad and toast supper which stood ready at the foot of the little verandah steps when we came back but nothing appeased that man of wrath and he said he would go straight back to the neglected family
so he went and the remainder of the precious time was disturbed by twinges of conscience to which i am much subject whenever i found myself wanting to jump for joy
i went to look at the painters every time my feet were for taking me to look at the garden i trotted diligently up and down the passages i criticised and suggested and commanded more in one day than i had done in all the rest of the time i wrote regularly and sent my love but i could not manage to fret and yearn
what are you to do if your conscience is clear and your liver in order and the sun is shining
may thi knew nothing whatever last year about gardening and this year know very little more but i have dawnings of what may be done and have at least made one great stridefrom ipomaea to tearoses
the garden was an absolute wilderness
it is all round the house but the principal part is on the south side and has evidently always been so
the south front is onestoried a long series of rooms opening one into the other and the walls are covered with virginia creeper
there is a little verandah in the middle leading by a flight of rickety wooden steps down into what seems to have been the only spot in the whole place that was ever cared for
this is a semicircle cut into the lawn and edged with privet and in this semicircle are eleven beds of different sizes bordered with box and arranged round a sundial and the sundial is very venerable and mossgrown and greatly beloved by me
these beds were the only sign of any attempt at gardening to be seen except a solitary crocus that came up all by itself each spring in the grass not because it wanted to but because it could not help it and these i had sown with ipomaea the whole eleven having found a german gardening book according to which ipomaea in vast quantities was the one thing needful to turn the most hideous desert into a paradise
nothing else in that book was recommended with anything like the same warmth and being entirely ignorant of the quantity of seed necessary i bought ten pounds of it and had it sown not only in the eleven beds but round nearly every tree and then waited in great agitation for the promised paradise to appear
it did not and i learned my first lesson
luckily i had sown two great patches of sweetpeas which made me very happy all the summer and then there were some sunflowers and a few hollyhocks under the south windows with madonna lilies in between
but the lilies after being transplanted disappeared to my great dismay for how was i to know it was the way of lilies
and the hollyhocks turned out to be rather ugly colours so that my first summer was decorated and beautified solely by sweetpeas
at present we are only just beginning to breathe after the bustle of getting new beds and borders and paths made in time for this summer
the eleven beds round the sundial are filled with roses but i see already that i have made mistakes with some
as i have not a living soul with whom to hold communion on this or indeed on any matter my only way of learning is by making mistakes
all eleven were to have been carpeted with purple pansies but finding that i had not enough and that nobody had any to sell me only six have got their pansies the others being sown with dwarf mignonette
two of the eleven are filled with marie van houtte roses two with viscountess folkestone two with laurette messimy one with souvenir de la malmaison one with adam and devoniensis two with persian yellow and bicolor and one big bed behind the sundial with three sorts of red roses seventytwo in all duke of teck cheshunt scarlet and prefet de limburg
this bed is i am sure a mistake and several of the others are i think but of course i must wait and see being such an ignorant person
then i have had two long beds made in the grass on either side of the semicircle each sown with mignonette and one filled with marie van houtte and the other with jules finger and the bride and in a warm corner under the drawingroom windows is a bed of madame lambard madame de watteville and comtesse riza du parc while farther down the garden sheltered on the north and west by a group of beeches and lilacs is another large bed containing rubens madame joseph schwartz and the hen
edith gifford
all these roses are dwarf i have only two standards in the whole garden two madame george bruants and they look like broomsticks
how i long for the day when the tearoses open their buds
never did i look forward so intensely to anything and every day i go the rounds admiring what the dear little things have achieved in the twentyfour hours in the way of new leaf or increase of lovely red shoot
the hollyhocks and lilies now flourishing are still under the south windows in a narrow border on the top of a grass slope at the foot of which i have sown two long borders of sweetpeas facing the rose beds so that my roses may have something almost as sweet as themselves to look at until the autumn when everything is to make place for more tearoses
the path leading away from this semicircle down the garden is bordered with china roses white and pink with here and there a persian yellow
i wish now i had put tearoses there and i have misgivings as to the effect of the persian yellows among the chinas for the chinas are such wee little baby things and the persian yellows look as though they intended to be big bushes
there is not a creature in all this part of the world who could in the least understand with what heartbeatings i am looking forward to the flowering of these roses and not a german gardening book that does not relegate all tearoses to hothouses imprisoning them for life and depriving them for ever of the breath of god
it was no doubt because i was so ignorant that i rushed in where teutonic angels fear to tread and made my tearoses face a northern winter but they did face it under fir branches and leaves and not one has suffered and they are looking today as happy and as determined to enjoy themselves as any roses i am sure in europe
may thtoday i am writing on the verandah with the three babies more persistent than mosquitoes raging round me and already several of the thirty fingers have been in the inkpot and the owners consoled when duty pointed to rebukes
but who can rebuke such penitent and drooping sunbonnets
i can see nothing but sunbonnets and pinafores and nimble black legs
these three their patient nurse myself the gardener and the gardeners assistant are the only people who ever go into my garden but then neither are we ever out of it
the gardener has been here a year and has given me notice regularly on the first of every month but up to now has been induced to stay on
on the first of this month he came as usual and with determination written on every feature told me he intended to go in june and that nothing should alter his decision
i dont think he knows much about gardening but he can at least dig and water and some of the things he sows come up and some of the plants he plants grow besides which he is the most unflaggingly industrious person i ever saw and has the great merit of never appearing to take the faintest interest in what we do in the garden
so i have tried to keep him on not knowing what the next one may be like and when i asked him what he had to complain of and he replied nothing i could only conclude that he has a personal objection to me because of my eccentric preference for plants in groups rather than plants in lines
perhaps too he does not like the extracts from gardening books i read to him sometimes when he is planting or sowing something new
being so helpless myself i thought it simpler instead of explaining to take the book itself out to him and let him have wisdom at its very source administering it in doses while he worked
i quite recognise that this must be annoying and only my anxiety not to lose a whole year through some stupid mistake has given me the courage to do it
i laugh sometimes behind the book at his disgusted face and wish we could be photographed so that i may be reminded in twenty years time when the garden is a bower of loveliness and i learned in all its ways of my first happy struggles and failures
all through april he was putting the perennials we had sown in the autumn into their permanent places and all through april he went about with a long piece of string making parallel lines down the borders of beautiful exactitude and arranging the poor plants like soldiers at a review
two long borders were done during my absence one day and when i explained that i should like the third to have plants in groups and not in lines and that what i wanted was a natural effect with no bare spaces of earth to be seen he looked even more gloomily hopeless than usual and on my going out later on to see the result i found he had planted two long borders down the sides of a straight walk with little lines of five plants in a rowfirst five pinks and next to them five rockets and behind the rockets five pinks and behind the pinks five rockets and so on with different plants of every sort and size down to the end
when i protested he said he had only carried out my orders and had known it would not look well so i gave in and the remaining borders were done after the pattern of the first two and i will have patience and see how they look this summer before digging them up again for it becomes beginners to be humble
if i could only dig and plant myself
how much easier besides being so fascinating to make your own holes exactly where you want them and put in your plants exactly as you choose instead of giving orders that can only be half understood from the moment you depart from the lines laid down by that long piece of string
in the first ecstasy of having a garden all my own and in my burning impatience to make the waste places blossom like a rose i did one warm sunday in last years april during the servants dinner hour doubly secure from the gardener by the day and the dinner slink out with a spade and a rake and feverishly dig a little piece of ground and break it up and sow surreptitious ipomaea and run back very hot and guilty into the house and get into a chair and behind a book and look languid just in time to save my reputation
and why not
it is not graceful and it makes one hot but it is a blessed sort of work and if eve had had a spade in paradise and known what to do with it we should not have had all that sad business of the apple
what a happy woman i am living in a garden with books babies birds and flowers and plenty of leisure to enjoy them
yet my town acquaintances look upon it as imprisonment and burying and i dont know what besides and would rend the air with their shrieks if condemned to such a life
sometimes i feel as if i were blest above all my fellows in being able to find my happiness so easily
i believe i should always be good if the sun always shone and could enjoy myself very well in siberia on a fine day
and what can life in town offer in the way of pleasure to equal the delight of any one of the calm evenings i have had this month sitting alone at the foot of the verandah steps with the perfume of young larches all about and the may moon hanging low over the beeches and the beautiful silence made only more profound in its peace by the croaking of distant frogs and hooting of owls
a cockchafer darting by close to my ear with a loud hum sends a shiver through me partly of pleasure at the reminder of past summers and partly of fear lest he should get caught in my hair
the man of wrath says they are pernicious creatures and should be killed
i would rather get the killing done at the end of the summer and not crush them out of such a pretty world at the very beginning of all the fun
this has been quite an eventful afternoon
my eldest baby born in april is five years old and the youngest born in june is three so that the discerning will at once be able to guess the age of the remaining middle or may baby
while i was stooping over a group of hollyhocks planted on the top of the only thing in the shape of a hill the garden possesses the april baby who had been sitting pensive on a tree stump close by got up suddenly and began to run aimlessly about shrieking and wringing her hands with every symptom of terror
i stared wondering what had come to her and then i saw that a whole army of young cows pasturing in a field next to the garden had got through the hedge and were grazing perilously near my tearoses and most precious belongings
the nurse and i managed to chase them away but not before they had trampled down a border of pinks and lilies in the cruellest way and made great holes in a bed of china roses and even begun to nibble at a jackmanni clematis that i am trying to persuade to climb up a tree trunk
the gloomy gardener happened to be ill in bed and the assistant was at vespersas lutheran germany calls afternoon tea or its equivalentso the nurse filled up the holes as well as she could with mould burying the crushed and mangled roses cheated for ever of their hopes of summer glory and i stood by looking on dejectedly
the june baby who is two feet square and valiant beyond her size and years seized a stick much bigger than herself and went after the cows the cowherd being nowhere to be seen
she planted herself in front of them brandishing her stick and they stood in a row and stared at her in great astonishment and she kept them off until one of the men from the farm arrived with a whip and having found the cowherd sleeping peacefully in the shade gave him a sound beating
the cowherd is a great hulking young man much bigger than the man who beat him but he took his punishment as part of the days work and made no remark of any sort
it could not have hurt him much through his leather breeches and i think he deserved it but it must be demoralising work for a strong young man with no brains looking after cows
nobody with less imagination than a poet ought to take it up as a profession
after the june baby and i had been welcomed back by the other two with as many hugs as though we had been restored to them from great perils and while we were peacefully drinking tea under a beech tree i happened to look up into its mazy green and there on a branch quite close to my head sat a little baby owl
i got on the seat and caught it easily for it could not fly and how it had reached the branch at all is a mystery
it is a little round ball of gray fluff with the quaintest wisest solemn face
poor thing
i ought to have let it go but the temptation to keep it until the man of wrath at present on a journey has seen it was not to be resisted as he has often said how much he would like to have a young owl and try and tame it
so i put it into a roomy cage and slung it up on a branch near where it had been sitting and which cannot be far from its nest and its mother
we had hardly subsided again to our tea when i saw two more balls of fluff on the ground in the long grass and scarcely distinguishable at a little distance from small molehills
these were promptly united to their relation in the cage and now when the man of wrath comes home not only shall he be welcomed by a wife decked with the orthodox smiles but by the three little longedfor owls
only it seems wicked to take them from their mother and i know that i shall let them go again some dayperhaps the very next time the man of wrath goes on a journey
i put a small pot of water in the cage though they never could have tasted water yet unless they drink the raindrops off the beech leaves
i suppose they get all the liquid they need from the bodies of the mice and other dainties provided for them by their fond parents
but the raindrop idea is prettier
may thhow cruel it was of me to put those poor little owls into a cage even for one night
i cannot forgive myself and shall never pander to the man of wraths wishes again
this morning i got up early to see how they were getting on and i found the door of the cage wide open and no owls to be seen
i thought of course that somebody had stolen themsome boy from the village or perhaps the chastised cowherd
but looking about i saw one perched high up in the branches of the beech tree and then to my dismay one lying dead on the ground
the third was nowhere to be seen and is probably safe in its nest
the parents must have torn at the bars of the cage until by chance they got the door open and then dragged the little ones out and up into the tree
the one that is dead must have been blown off the branch as it was a windy night and its neck is broken
there is one happy life less in the garden today through my fault and it is such a lovely warm dayjust the sort of weather for young soft things to enjoy and grow in
the babies are greatly distressed and are digging a grave and preparing funeral wreaths of dandelions
just as i had written that i heard sounds of arrival and running out i breathlessly told the man of wrath how nearly i had been able to give him the owls he has so often said he would like to have and how sorry i was they were gone and how grievous the death of one and so on after the voluble manner of women
he listened till i paused to breathe and then he said i am surprised at such cruelty
how could you make the mother owl suffer so
she had never done you any harm  which sent me out of the house and into the garden more convinced than ever that he sang true who sang       two paradises twere in one to live in paradise alone
may ththe garden is the place i go to for refuge and shelter not the house
in the house are duties and annoyances servants to exhort and admonish furniture and meals but out there blessings crowd round me at every stepit is there that i am sorry for the unkindness in me for those selfish thoughts that are so much worse than they feel it is there that all my sins and silliness are forgiven there that i feel protected and at home and every flower and weed is a friend and every tree a lover
when i have been vexed i run out to them for comfort and when i have been angry without just cause it is there that i find absolution
did ever a woman have so many friends
and always the same always ready to welcome me and fill me with cheerful thoughts
happy children of a common father why should i their own sister be less content and joyous than they
even in a thunder storm when other people are running into the house i run out of it
i do not like thunder stormsthey frighten me for hours before they come because i always feel them on the way but it is odd that i should go for shelter to the garden
i feel better there more taken care of more petted
when it thunders the april baby says theres lieber gott scolding those angels again and once when there was a storm in the night she complained loudly and wanted to know why lieber gott didnt do the scolding in the daytime as she had been so tight asleep
they all three speak a wonderful mixture of german and english adulterating the purity of their native tongue by putting in english words in the middle of a german sentence
it always reminds me of justice tempered by mercy
we have been cowslipping today in a little wood dignified by the name of the hirschwald because it is the happy huntingground of innumerable deer who fight there in the autumn evenings calling each other out to combat with bayings that ring through the silence and send agreeable shivers through the lonely listener
i often walk there in september late in the evening and sitting on a fallen tree listen fascinated to their angry cries
we made cowslip balls sitting on the grass
the babies had never seen such things nor had imagined anything half so sweet
the hirschwald is a little open wood of silver birches and springy turf starred with flowers and there is a tiny stream meandering amiably about it and decking itself in june with yellow flags
i have dreams of having a little cottage built there with the daisies up to the door and no path of any sortjust big enough to hold myself and one baby inside and a purple clematis outside
two roomsa bedroom and a kitchen
how scared we would be at night and how completely happy by day
i know the exact spot where it should stand facing southeast so that we should get all the cheerfulness of the morning and close to the stream so that we might wash our plates among the flags
sometimes when in the mood for society we would invite the remaining babies to tea and entertain them with wild strawberries on plates of horsechestnut leaves but no one less innocent and easily pleased than a baby would be permitted to darken the effulgence of our sunny cottageindeed i dont suppose that anybody wiser would care to come
wise people want so many things before they can even begin to enjoy themselves and i feel perpetually apologetic when with them for only being able to offer them that which i love best myselfapologetic and ashamed of being so easily contented
the other day at a dinner party in the nearest town it took us the whole afternoon to get there the women after dinner were curious to know how i had endured the winter cut off from everybody and snowed up sometimes for weeks
ah these husbands sighed an ample lady lugubriously shaking her head they shut up their wives because it suits them and dont care what their sufferings are  then the others sighed and shook their heads too for the ample lady was a great local potentate and one began to tell how another dreadful husband had brought his young wife into the country and had kept her there concealing her beauty and accomplishments from the public in a most cruel manner and how after spending a certain number of years in alternately weeping and producing progeny she had quite lately run away with somebody unspeakablei think it was the footman or the baker or some one of that sort
but i am quite happy i began as soon as i could put in a word
ah a good little wife making the best of it and the female potentate patted my hand but continued gloomily to shake her head
you cannot possibly be happy in the winter entirely alone asserted another lady the wife of a high military authority and not accustomed to be contradicted
but i am  but how can you possibly be at your age
no it is not possible  but i am  your husband ought to bring you to town in the winter  but i dont want to be brought to town  and not let you waste your best years buried but i like being buried  such solitude is not right  but im not solitary  and can come to no good she was getting quite angry
there was a chorus of no indeeds at her last remark and renewed shaking of heads
i enjoyed the winter immensely i persisted when they were a little quieter i sleighed and skated and then there were the children and shelves and shelves full of i was going to say books but stopped
reading is an occupation for men for women it is reprehensible waste of time
and how could i talk to them of the happiness i felt when the sun shone on the snow or of the deep delight of hearfrost days
it is entirely my doing that we have come down here i proceeded and my husband only did it to please me  such a good little wife repeated the patronising potentate again patting my hand with an air of understanding all about it really an excellent little wife
but you must not let your husband have his own way too much my dear and take my advice and insist on his bringing you to town next winter and then they fell to talking about their cooks having settled to their entire satisfaction that my fate was probably lying in wait for me too lurking perhaps at that very moment behind the apparently harmless brass buttons of the man in the hall with my cloak
i laughed on the way home and i laughed again for sheer satisfaction when we reached the garden and drove between the quiet trees to the pretty old house and when i went into the library with its four windows open to the moonlight and the scent and looked round at the familiar bookshelves and could hear no sounds but sounds of peace and knew that here i might read or dream or idle exactly as i chose with never a creature to disturb me how grateful i felt to the kindly fate that has brought me here and given me a heart to understand my own blessedness and rescued me from a life like that i had just seena life spent with the odours of other peoples dinners in ones nostrils and the noise of their wrangling servants in ones ears and parties and tattle for all amusement
but i must confess to having felt sometimes quite crushed when some grand person examining the details of my home through her eyeglass and coolly dissecting all that i so much prize from the convenient distance of the open window has finished up by expressing sympathy with my loneliness and on my protesting that i like it has murmured sebr anspruchslos then indeed i have felt ashamed of the fewness of my wants but only for a moment and only under the withering influence of the eyeglass for after all the owners spirit is the same spirit as that which dwells in my servantsgirls whose one idea of happiness is to live in a town where there are others of their sort with whom to drink beer and dance on sunday afternoons
the passion for being for ever with ones fellows and the fear of being left for a few hours alone is to me wholly incomprehensible
i can entertain myself quite well for weeks together hardly aware except for the pervading peace that i have been alone at all
not but what i like to have people staying with me for a few days or even for a few weeks should they be as anspruchslos as i am myself and content with simple joys only any one who comes here and would be happy must have something in him if he be a mere blank creature empty of head and heart he will very probably find it dull
i should like my house to be often full if i could find people capable of enjoying themselves
they should be welcomed and sped with equal heartiness for truth compels me to confess that though it pleases me to see them come it pleases me just as much to see them go
on some very specially divine days like today i have actually longed for some one else to be here to enjoy the beauty with me
there has been rain in the night and the whole garden seems to be singingnot the untiring birds only but the vigorous plants the happy grass and trees the lilac bushesoh those lilac bushes
they are all out today and the garden is drenched with the scent
i have brought in armfuls the picking is such a delight and every pot and bowl and tub in the house is filled with purple glory and the servants think there is going to be a party and are extra nimble and i go from room to room gazing at the sweetness and the windows are all flung open so as to join the scent within to the scent without and the servants gradually discover that there is no party and wonder why the house should be filled with flowers for one woman by herself and i long more and more for a kindred spiritit seems so greedy to have so much loveliness to oneselfbut kindred spirits are so very very rare i might almost as well cry for the moon
it is true that my garden is full of friends only they aredumb
june rdthis is such an outoftheway corner of the world that it requires quite unusual energy to get here at all and i am thus delivered from casual callers while on the other hand people i love or people who love me which is much the same thing are not likely to be deterred from coming by the roundabout train journey and the long drive at the end
not the least of my many blessings is that we have only one neighbour
if you have to have neighbours at all it is at least a mercy that there should be only one for with people dropping in at all hours and wanting to talk to you how are you to get on with your life i should like to know and read your books and dream your dreams to your satisfaction
besides there is always the certainty that either you or the dropperin will say something that would have been better left unsaid and i have a holy horror of gossip and mischiefmaking
a womans tongue is a deadly weapon and the most difficult thing in the world to keep in order and things slip off it with a facility nothing short of appalling at the very moment when it ought to be most quiet
in such cases the only safe course is to talk steadily about cooks and children and to pray that the visit may not be too prolonged for if it is you are lost
cooks i have found to be the best of all subjectsthe most phlegmatic flush into life at the mere word and the joys and sufferings connected with them are experiences common to us all
luckily our neighbour and his wife are both busy and charming with a whole troop of flaxenhaired little children to keep them occupied besides the business of their large estate
our intercourse is arranged on lines of the most beautiful simplicity
i call on her once a year and she returns the call a fortnight later they ask us to dinner in the summer and we ask them to dinner in the winter
by strictly keeping to this we avoid all danger of that closer friendship which is only another name for frequent quarrels
she is a pattern of what a german country lady should be and is not only a pretty woman but an energetic and practical one and the combination is to say the least effective
she is up at daylight superintending the feeding of the stock the buttermaking the sending off of the milk for sale a thousand things get done while most people are fast asleep and before lazy folk are well at breakfast she is off in her ponycarriage to the other farms on the place to rate the mamsells as the head women are called to poke into every corner lift the lids off the saucepans count the newlaid eggs and box if necessary any careless dairymaids ears
we are allowed by law to administer slight corporal punishment to our servants it being left entirely to individual taste to decide what slight shall be and my neighbour really seems to enjoy using this privilege judging from the way she talks about it
i would give much to be able to peep through a keyhole and see the dauntless little lady terrible in her wrath and dignity standing on tiptoe to box the ears of some great strapping girl big enough to eat her
the making of cheese and butter and sausages excellently well is a work which requires brains and is to my thinking a very admirable form of activity and entirely worthy of the attention of the intelligent
that my neighbour is intelligent is at once made evident by the bright alertness of her eyeseyes that nothing escapes and that only gain in prettiness by being used to some good purpose
she is a recognised authority for miles around on the mysteries of sausagemaking the care of calves and the slaughtering of swine and with all her manifold duties and daily prolonged absences from home her children are patterns of health and neatness and of what dear little german children with white pigtails and fearless eyes and thick legs should be
who shall say that such a life is sordid and dull and unworthy of a high order of intelligence
i protest that to me it is a beautiful life full of wholesome outdoor work and with no room for those listless moments of depression and boredom and of wondering what you will do next that leave wrinkles round a pretty womans eyes and are not unknown even to the most brilliant
but while admiring my neighbour i dont think i shall ever try to follow in her steps my talents not being of the energetic and organising variety but rather of that order which makes their owner almost lamentably prone to take up a volume of poetry and wander out to where the kingcups grow and sitting on a willow trunk beside a little stream forget the very existence of everything but green pastures and still waters and the glad blowing of the wind across the joyous fields
and it would make me perfectly wretched to be confronted by ears so refractory as to require boxing
sometimes callers from a distance invade my solitude and it is on these occasions that i realise how absolutely alone each individual is and how far away from his neighbour and while they talk generally about babies past present and to come i fall to wondering at the vast and impassable distance that separates ones own soul from the soul of the person sitting in the next chair
i am speaking of comparative strangers people who are forced to stay a certain time by the eccentricities of trains and in whose presence you grope about after common interests and shrink back into your shell on finding that you have none
then a frost slowly settles down on me and i grow each minute more benumbed and speechless and the babies feel the frost in the air and look vacant and the callers go through the usual form of wondering who they most take after generally settling the question by saying that the may baby who is the beauty is like her father and that the two more or less plain ones are the image of me and this decision though i know it of old and am sure it is coming never fails to depress me as much as though i heard it for the first time
the babies are very little and inoffensive and good and it is hard that they should be used as a means of filling up gaps in conversation and their features pulled to pieces one by one and all their weak points noted and criticised while they stand smiling shyly in the operators face their very smile drawing forth comments on the shape of their mouths but after all it does not occur very often and they are one of those few interests one has in common with other people as everybody seems to have babies
a garden i have discovered is by no means a fruitful topic and it is amazing how few persons really love theirsthey all pretend they do but you can hear by the very tone of their voice what a lukewarm affection it is
about june their interest is at its warmest nourished by agreeable supplies of strawberries and roses but on reflection i dont know a single person within twenty miles who really cares for his garden or has discovered the treasures of happiness that are buried in it and are to be found if sought for diligently and if needs be with tears
it is after these rare calls that i experience the only moments of depression from which i ever suffer and then i am angry at myself a wellnourished person for allowing even a single precious hour of life to be spoil by anything so indifferent
that is the worst of being fed enough and clothed enough and warmed enough and of having everything you can reasonably desireon the least provocation you are made uncomfortable and unhappy by such abstract discomforts as being shut out from a nearer approach to your neighbours soul which is on the face of it foolish the probability being that he hasnt got one
the rockets are all out
the gardener in a fit of inspiration put them right along the very front of two borders and i dont know what his feelings can be now that they are all flowering and the plants behind are completely hidden but i have learned another lesson and no future gardener shall be allowed to run riot among my rockets in quite so reckless a fashion
they are charming things as delicate in colour as in scent and a bowl of them on my writingtable fills the room with fragrance
single rows however are a mistake i had masses of them planted in the grass and these show how lovely they can be
a border full of rockets mauve and white and nothing else must be beautiful but i dont know how long they last nor what they look like when they have done flowering
this i shall find out in a week or two i suppose
was ever a wouldbe gardener left so entirely to his own blundering
no doubt it would be a gain of years to the garden if i were not forced to learn solely by my failures and if i had some kind creature to tell me when to do things
at present the only flowers in the garden are the rockets the pansies in the rose beds and two groups of azaleasmollis and pontica
the azaleas have been and still are gorgeous i only planted them this spring and they almost at once began to flower and the sheltered corner they are in looks as though it were filled with imprisoned and perpetual sunsets
orange lemon pink in every delicate shadewhat they will be next year and in succeeding years when the bushes are bigger i can imagine from the way they have begun life
on gray dull days the effect is absolutely startling
next autumn i shall make a great bank of them in front of a belt of fir trees in rather a gloomy nook
my tearoses are covered with buds which will not open for at least another week so i conclude this is not the sort of climate where they will flower from the very beginning of june to november as they are said to do
july ththere has been no rain since the day before whitsunday five weeks ago which partly but not entirely accounts for the disappointment my beds have been
the dejected gardener went mad soon after whitsuntide and had to be sent to an asylum
he took to going about with a spade in one hand and a revolver in the other explaining that he felt safer that way and we bore it quite patiently as becomes civilised beings who respect each others prejudices until one day when i mildly asked him to tie up a fallen creeperand after he bought the revolver my tones in addressing him were of the mildest and i quite left off reading to him aloudhe turned round looked me straight in the face for the first time since he has been here and said do i look like graf x a great local celebrity or like a monkey  after which there was nothing for it but to get him into an asylum as expeditiously as possible
there was no gardener to be had in his place and i have only just succeeded in getting one so that what with the drought and the neglect and the gardeners madness and my blunders the garden is in a sad condition but even in a sad condition it is the dearest place in the world and all my mistakes only make me more determined to persevere
the long borders where the rockets were are looking dreadful
the rockets have done flowering and after the manner of rockets in other walks of life have degenerated into sticks and nothing else in those borders intends to bloom this summer
the giant poppies i had planted out in them in april have either died off or remained quite small and so have the columbines here and there a delphinium droops unwillingly and that is all
i suppose poppies cannot stand being moved or perhaps they were not watered enough at the time of transplanting anyhow those borders are going to be sown tomorrow with more poppies for next year for poppies i will have whether they like it or not and they shall not be touched only thinned out
well it is no use being grieved and after all directly i come out and sit under the trees and look at the dappled sky and see the sunshine on the cornfields away on the plain all the disappointment smooths itself out and it seems impossible to be sad and discontented when everything about me is so radiant and kind
today is sunday and the garden is so quiet that sitting here in this shady corner watching the lazy shadows stretching themselves across the grass and listening to the rooks quarrelling in the treetops i almost expect to hear english church bells ringing for the afternoon service
but the church is three miles off has no bells and no afternoon service
once a fortnight we go to morning prayer at eleven and sit up in a sort of private box with a room behind whither we can retire unobserved when the sermon is too long or our flesh too weak and hear ourselves being prayed for by the blackrobed parson
in winter the church is bitterly cold it is not heated and we sit muffled up in more furs than ever we wear out of doors but it would of course be very wicked for the parson to wear furs however cold he may be so he puts on a great many extra coats under his gown and as the winter progresses swells to a prodigious size
we know when spring is coming by the reduction in his figure
the congregation sit at ease while the parson does the praying for them and while they are droning the longdrawnout chorales he retires into a little wooden box just big enough to hold him
he does not come out until he thinks we have sung enough nor do we stop until his appearance gives us the signal
i have often thought how dreadful it would be if he fell ill in his box and left us to go on singing
i am sure we should never dare to stop unauthorised by the church
i asked him once what he did in there he looked very shocked at such a profane question and made an evasive reply
if it were not for the garden a german sunday would be a terrible day but in the garden on that day there is a sigh of relief and more profound peace nobody raking or sweeping or fidgeting only the little flowers themselves and the whispering trees
i have been much afflicted again lately by visitorsnot stray callers to be got rid of after a due administration of tea and things you are sorry afterwards that you said but people staying in the house and not to be got rid of at all
all june was lost to me in this way and it was from first to last a radiant month of heat and beauty but a garden where you meet the people you saw at breakfast and will see again at lunch and dinner is not a place to be happy in
besides they had a knack of finding out my favourite seats and lounging in them just when i longed to lounge myself and they took books out of the library with them and left them face downwards on the seats all night to get well drenched with dew though they might have known that what is meat for roses is poison for books and they gave me to understand that if they had had the arranging of the garden it would have been finished long agowhereas i dont believe a garden ever is finished
they have all gone now thank heaven except one so that i have a little breathing space before others begin to arrive
it seems that the place interests people and that there is a sort of novelty in staying in such a deserted corner of the world for they were in a perpetual state of mild amusement at being here at all
irais is the only one left
she is a young woman with a beautiful refined face and her eyes and straight fine eyebrows are particularly lovable
at meals she dips her bread into the saltcellar bites a bit off and repeats the process although providence taking my shape has caused saltspoons to be placed at convenient intervals down the table
she lunched today on beer schweinekoteletten and cabbagesalad with caraway seeds in it and now i hear her through the open window extemporising touching melodies in her charming cooing voice
she is thin frail intelligent and lovable all on the above diet
what better proof can be needed to establish the superiority of the teuton than the fact that after such meals he can produce such music
cabbage salad is a horrid invention but i dont doubt its utility as a means of encouraging thoughtfulness nor will i quarrel with it since it results so poetically any more than i quarrel with the manure that results in roses and i give it to irais every day to make her sing
she is the sweetest singer i have ever heard and has a charming trick of making up songs as she goes along
when she begins i go and lean out of the window and look at my little friends out there in the borders while listening to her music and feel full of pleasant sadness and regret
it is so sweet to be sad when one has nothing to be sad about
the april baby came panting up just as i had written that the others hurrying along behind and with flaming cheeks displayed for my admiration three brandnew kittens lean and blind that she was carrying in her pinafore and that had just been found motherless in the woodshed
look she cried breathlessly such a much  i was glad it was only kittens this time for she had been once before this afternoon on purpose as she informed me sitting herself down on the grass at my feet to ask about the lieber gott it being sunday and her pious little nurses conversation having run as it seems on heaven and angels
her questions about the lieber gott are better left unrecorded and i was relieved when she began about the angels
what do they wear for clothes she asked in her germanenglish
why youve seen them in pictures i answered in beautiful long dresses and with big white wings feathers she asked
i suppose soand long dresses all white and beautiful  are they girlies  girls
yees  dont boys go into the himmel  yes of course if theyre good  and then what do they wear why the same as all the other angels i suppose  dwesses  she began to laugh looking at me sideways as though she suspected me of making jokes
what a funny mummy she said evidently much amused
she has a fat little laugh that is very infectious
i think said i gravely you had better go and play with the other babies  she did not answer and sat still a moment watching the clouds
i began writing again
mummy she said presently
well  where do the angels get their dwesses  i hesitated
from lieber gott i said
are there shops in the himmel  shops
no  but then where does lieber gott buy their dwesses  now run away like a good baby im busy  but you said yesterday when i asked about lieber gott that you would tell about him on sunday and it is sunday
tell me a story about him  there was nothing for it but resignation so i put down my pencil with a sigh
call the others then  she ran away and presently they all three emerged from the bushes one after the other and tried all together to scramble on to my knee
the april baby got the knee as she always seems to get everything and the other two had to sit on the grass
i began about adam and eve with an eye to future parsonic probings
the april babys eyes opened wider and wider and her face grew redder and redder
i was surprised at the breathless interest she took in the storythe other two were tearing up tufts of grass and hardly listening
i had scarcely got to the angels with the flaming swords and announced that that was all when she burst out now ill tell about it
once upon a time there was adam and eva and they had plenty of clothes and there was no snake and lieber gott wasnt angry with them and they could eat as many apples as they liked and was happy for ever and everthere now  she began to jump up and down defiantly on my knee
but thats not the story i said rather helplessly
yes yes
its a much nicelier one
now another  but these stories are true i said severely and its no use my telling them if you make them up your own way afterwards  another
another she shrieked jumping up and down with redoubled energy all her silvery curls flying
i began about noah and the flood
did it rain so badly she asked with a face of the deepest concern and interest
yes all day long and all night long for weeks and weeks  and was everybody so wet  yes  but why didnt they open their umbwellas  just then i saw the nurse coming out with the teatray
ill tell you the rest another time i said putting her off my knee greatly relieved you must all go to anna now and have tea  i dont like anna remarked the june baby not having hitherto opened her lips she is a stupid girl  the other two stood transfixed with horror at this statement for besides being naturally extremely polite and at all times anxious not to hurt any ones feelings they had been brought up to love and respect their kind little nurse
the april baby recovered her speech first and lifting her finger pointed it at the criminal in just indignation
such a child will never go into the himmel she said with great emphasis and the air of one who delivers judgment
september ththis is the month of quiet days crimson creepers and blackberries of mellow afternoons in the ripening garden of tea under the acacias instead of the too shady beeches of woodfires in the library in the chilly evenings
the babies go out in the afternoon and blackberry in the hedges the three kittens grown big and fat sit cleaning themselves on the sunny verandah steps the man of wrath shoots partridges across the distant stubble and the summer seems as though it would dream on for ever
it is hard to believe that in three months we shall probably be snowed up and certainly be cold
there is a feeling about this month that reminds me of march and the early days of april when spring is still hesitating on the threshold and the garden holds its breath in expectation
there is the same mildness in the air and the sky and grass have the same look as then but the leaves tell a different tale and the reddening creeper on the house is rapidly approaching its last and loveliest glory
my roses have behaved as well on the whole as was to be expected and the viscountess folkestones and laurette messimys have been most beautiful the latter being quite the loveliest things in the garden each flower an exquisite loose cluster of coralpink petals paling at the base to a yellowwhite
i have ordered a hundred standard tearoses for planting next month half of which are viscountess folkestones because the tearoses have such a way of hanging their little heads that one has to kneel down to be able to see them well in the dwarf formsnot but what i entirely approve of kneeling before such perfect beauty only it dirties ones clothes
so i am going to put standards down each side of the walk under the south windows and shall have the flowers on a convenient level for worship
my only fear is that they will stand the winter less well than the dwarf sorts being so difficult to pack up snugly
the persian yellows and bicolors have been as i predicted a mistake among the tearoses they only flower twice in the season and all the rest of the time look dull and moping and then the persian yellows have such an odd smell and so many insects inside them eating them up
i have ordered safrano tearoses to put in their place as they all come out next month and are to be grouped in the grass and the semicircle being immediately under the windows besides having the best position in the place must be reserved solely for my choicest treasures
i have had a great many disappointments but feel as though i were really beginning to learn
humility and the most patient perseverance seem almost as necessary in gardening as rain and sunshine and every failure must be used as a steppingstone to something better
i had a visitor last week who knows a great deal about gardening and has had much practical experience
when i heard he was coming i felt i wanted to put my arms right round my garden and hide it from him but what was my surprise and delight when he said after having gone all over it well i think you have done wonders dear me how pleased i was
it was so entirely unexpected and such a complete novelty after the remarks i have been listening to all the summer
i could have hugged that discerning and indulgent critic able to look beyond the result to the intention and appreciating the difficulties of every kind that had been in the way
after that i opened my heart to him and listened reverently to all he had to say and treasured up his kind and encouraging advice and wished he could stay here a whole year and help me through the seasons
but he went as people one likes always do go and he was the only guest i have had whose departure made me sorry
the people i love are always somewhere else and not able to come to me while i can at any time fill the house with visitors about whom i know little and care less
perhaps if i saw more of those absent ones i would not love them so wellat least that is what i think on wet days when the wind is howling round the house and all nature is overcome with grief and it has actually happened once or twice when great friends have been staying with me that i have wished when they left i might not see them again for at least ten years
i suppose the fact is that no friendship can stand the breakfast test and here in the country we invariably think it our duty to appear at breakfast
civilisation has done away with curlpapers yet at that hour the soul of the hausfrau is as tightly screwed up in them as was ever her grandmothers hair and though my body comes down mechanically having been trained that way by punctual parents my soul never thinks of beginning to wake up for other people till lunchtime and never does so completely till it has been taken out of doors and aired in the sunshine
who can begin conventional amiability the first thing in the morning
it is the hour of savage instincts and natural tendencies it is the triumph of the disagreeable and the cross
i am convinced that the muses and the graces never thought of having breakfast anywhere but in bed
november thwhen the gray november weather came and hung its soft dark clouds low and unbroken over the brown of the ploughed fields and the vivid emerald of the stretches of winter corn the heavy stillness weighed my heart down to a forlorn yearning after the pleasant things of childhood the petting the comforting the warming faith in the unfailing wisdom of elders
a great need of something to lean on and a great weariness of independence and responsibility took possession of my soul and looking round for support and comfort in that transitory mood the emptiness of the present and the blankness of the future sent me back to the past with all its ghosts
why should i not go and see the place where i was born and where i lived so long the place where i was so magnificently happy so exquisitely wretched so close to heaven so near to hell always either up on a cloud of glory or down in the depths with the waters of despair closing over my head
cousins live in it now distant cousins loved with the exact measure of love usually bestowed on cousins who reign in ones stead cousins of practical views who have dug up the flowerbeds and planted cabbages where roses grew and though through all the years since my fathers death i have held my head so high that it hurt and loftily refused to listen to their repeated suggestions that i should revisit my old home something in the sad listlessness of the november days sent my spirit back to old times with a persistency that would not be set aside and i woke from my musings surprised to find myself sick with longing
it is foolish but natural to quarrel with ones cousins and especially foolish and natural when they have done nothing and are mere victims of chance
is it their fault that my not being a boy placed the shoes i should otherwise have stepped into at their disposal
i know it is not but their blamelessness does not make me love them more
noch ein dummes frauenzimmer cried my father on my arrival into the worldhe had three of them already and i was his last hopeand a dummes frauenzimmer i have remained ever since and that is why for years i would have no dealings with the cousins in possession and that is why the other day overcome by the tender influence of the weather the purely sentimental longing to join hands again with my childhood was enough to send all my pride to the winds and to start me off without warning and without invitation on my pilgrimage
i have always had a liking for pilgrimages and if i had lived in the middle ages would have spent most of my time on the way to rome
the pilgrims leaving all their cares at home the anxieties of their riches or their debts the wife that worried and the children that disturbed took only their sins with them and turning their backs on their obligations set out with that sole burden and perhaps a cheerful heart
how cheerful my heart would have been starting on a fine morning with the smell of the spring in my nostrils fortified by the approval of those left behind accompanied by the pious blessings of my family with every step getting farther from the suffocation of daily duties out into the wide fresh world out into the glorious free world so poor so penitent and so happy
my dream even now is to walk for weeks with some friend that i love leisurely wandering from place to place with no route arranged and no object in view with liberty to go on all day or to linger all day as we choose but the question of luggage unknown to the simple pilgrim is one of the rocks on which my plans have been shipwrecked and the other is the certain censure of relatives who not fond of walking themselves and having no taste for noonday naps under hedges would be sure to paralyse my plans before they had grown to maturity by the honest horror of their cry how very unpleasant if you were to meet any one you know the relative of five hundred years back would simply have said how holy  my father had the same liking for pilgrimagesindeed it is evident that i have it from himand he encouraged it in me when i was little taking me with him on his pious journeys to places he had lived in as a boy
often have we been together to the school he was at in brandenburg and spent pleasant days wandering about the old town on the edge of one of those lakes that lie in a chain in that wide green plain and often have we been in potsdam where he was quartered as a lieutenant the potsdam pilgrimage including hours in the woods around and in the gardens of sans souci with the second volume of carlyles frederick under my fathers arm and often did we spend long summer days at the house in the mark at the head of the same blue chain of lakes where his mother spent her young years and where though it belonged to cousins like everything else that was worth having we could wander about as we chose for it was empty and sit in the deep windows of rooms where there was no furniture and the painted venuses and cupids on the ceiling still smiled irrelevantly and stretched their futile wreaths above the emptiness beneath
and while we sat and rested my father told me as my grandmother had a hundred times told him all that had happened in those rooms in the faroff days when people danced and sang and laughed through life and nobody seemed ever to be old or sorry
there was and still is an inn within a stones throw of the great iron gates with two very old lime trees in front of it where we used to lunch on our arrival at a little table spread with a red and blue check cloth the lime blossoms dropping into our soup and the bees humming in the scented shadows overhead
i have a picture of the house by my side as i write done from the lake in old times with a boat full of ladies in hoops and powder in the foreground and a youth playing a guitar
the pilgrimages to this place were those i loved the best
but the stories my father told me sometimes odd enough stories to tell a little girl as we wandered about the echoing rooms or hung over the stone balustrade and fed the fishes in the lake or picked the pale dogroses in the hedges or lay in the boat in a shady reedgrown bay while he smoked to keep the mosquitoes off were after all only traditions imparted to me in small doses from time to time when his earnest desire not to raise his remarks above the level of dulness supposed to be wholesome for backfische was neutralised by an impulse to share his thoughts with somebody who would laugh whereas the place i was bound for on my latest pilgrimage was filled with living firsthand memories of all the enchanted years that lie between two and eighteen
how enchanted those years are is made more and more clear to me the older i grow
there has been nothing in the least like them since and though i have forgotten most of what happened six months ago every incident almost every day of those wonderful long years is perfectly distinct in my memory
but i had been stiffnecked proud unpleasant altogether cousinly in my behaviour towards the people in possession
the invitations to revisit the old home had ceased
the cousins had grown tired of refusals and had left me alone
i did not even know who lived in it now it was so long since i had had any news
for two days i fought against the strong desire to go there that had suddenly seized me and assured myself that i would not go that it would be absurd to go undignified sentimental and silly that i did not know them and would be in an awkward position and that i was old enough to know better
but who can foretell from one hour to the next what a woman will do
and when does she ever know better
on the third morning i set out as hopefully as though it were the most natural thing in the world to fall unexpectedly upon hitherto consistently neglected cousins and expect to be received with open arms
it was a complicated journey and lasted several hours
during the first part when it was still dark i glowed with enthusiasm with the spirit of adventure with delight at the prospect of so soon seeing the loved place again and thought with wonder of the long years i had allowed to pass since last i was there
of what i should say to the cousins and of how i should introduce myself into their midst i did not think at all the pilgrim spirit was upon me the unpractical spirit that takes no thought for anything but simply wanders along enjoying its own emotions
it was a quiet sad morning and there was a thick mist
by the time i was in the little train on the light railway that passed through the village nearest my old home i had got over my first enthusiasm and had entered the stage of critically examining the changes that had been made in the last ten years
it was so misty that i could see nothing of the familiar country from the carriage windows only the ghosts of pines in the front row of the forests but the railway itself was a new departure unknown in our day when we used to drive over ten miles of deep sandy forest roads to and from the station and although most people would have called it an evident and great improvement it was an innovation due no doubt to the zeal and energy of the reigning cousin and who was he thought i that he should require more conveniences than my father had found needful
it was no use my telling myself that in my fathers time the era of light railways had not dawned and that if it had we should have done our utmost to secure one the thought of my cousin stepping into my shoes and then altering them was odious to me
by the time i was walking up the hill from the station i had got over this feeling too and had entered a third stage of wondering uneasily what in the world i should do next
where was the intrepid courage with which i had started
at the top of the first hill i sat down to consider this question in detail for i was very near the house now and felt i wanted time
where indeed was the courage and joy of the morning
it had vanished so completely that i could only suppose that it must be lunch time the observations of years having led to the discovery that the higher sentiments and virtues fly affrighted on the approach of lunch and none fly quicker than courage
so i ate the lunch i had brought with me hoping that it was what i wanted but it was chilly made up of sandwiches and pears and it had to be eaten under a tree at the edge of a field and it was november and the mist was thicker than ever and very wetthe grass was wet with it the gaunt tree was wet with it i was wet with it and the sandwiches were wet with it
nobodys spirits can keep up under such conditions and as i ate the soaked sandwiches i deplored the headlong courage more with each mouthful that had torn me from a warm dry home where i was appreciated and had brought me first to the damp tree in the damp field and when i had finished my lunch and dessert of cold pears was going to drag me into the midst of a circle of unprepared and astonished cousins
vast sheep loomed through the mist a few yards off
the sheep dog kept up a perpetual irritating yap
in the fog i could hardly tell where i was though i knew i must have played there a hundred times as a child
after the fashion of woman directly she is not perfectly warm and perfectly comfortable i began to consider the uncertainty of human life and to shake my head in gloomy approval as lugubrious lines of pessimistic poetry suggested themselves to my mind
now it is clearly a desirable plan if you want to do anything to do it in the way consecrated by custom more especially if you are a woman
the rattle of a carriage along the road just behind me and the fact that i started and turned suddenly hot drove this truth home to my soul
the mist hid me and the carriage no doubt full of cousins drove on in the direction of the house but what an absurd position i was in
suppose the kindly mist had lifted and revealed me lunching in the wet on their property the cousin of the short and lofty letters the unangenehme elisabeth
die war doch immer verdreht i could imagine them hastily muttering to each other before advancing wreathed in welcoming smiles
it gave me a great shock this narrow escape and i got on to my feet quickly and burying the remains of my lunch under the gigantic molehill on which i had been sitting asked myself nervously what i proposed to do next
should i walk back to the village go to the gasthof write a letter craving permission to call on my cousins and wait there till an answer came
it would be a discreet and sober course to pursue the next best thing to having written before leaving home
but the gasthof of a north german village is a dreadful place and the remembrance of one in which i had taken refuge once from a thunderstorm was still so vivid that nature itself cried out against this plan
the mist if anything was growing denser
i knew every path and gate in the place
what if i gave up all hope of seeing the house and went through the little door in the wall at the bottom of the garden and confined myself for this once to that
in such weather i would be able to wander round as i pleased without the least risk of being seen by or meeting any cousins and it was after all the garden that lay nearest my heart
what a delight it would be to creep into it unobserved and revisit all the corners i so well remembered and slip out again and get away safely without any need of explanations assurances protestations displays of affection without any need in a word of that exhausting form of conversation so dear to relations known as redensarten
the mist tempted me
i think if it had been a fine day i would have gone soberly to the gasthof and written the conciliatory letter but the temptation was too great it was altogether irresistible and in ten minutes i had found the gate opened it with some difficulty and was standing with a beating heart in the garden of my childhood
now i wonder whether i shall ever again feel thrills of the same potency as those that ran through me at that moment
first of all i was trespassing which is in itself thrilling but how much more thrilling when you are trespassing on what might just as well have been your own ground on what actually was for years your own ground and when you are in deadly peril of seeing the rightful owners whom you have never met but with whom you have quarrelled appear round the corner and of hearing them remark with an inquiring and awful politeness i do not think i have the pleasure then the place was unchanged
i was standing in the same mysterious tangle of damp little paths that had always been just there they curled away on either side among the shrubs with the brown tracks of recent footsteps in the centre of their green stains just as they did in my day
the overgrown lilac bushes still met above my head
the moisture dripped from the same ledge in the wall on to the sodden leaves beneath as it had done all through the afternoons of all those past novembers
this was the place this damp and gloomy tangle that had specially belonged to me
nobody ever came to it for in winter it was too dreary and in summer so full of mosquitoes that only a backfisch indifferent to spots could have borne it
but it was a place where i could play unobserved and where i could walk up and down uninterrupted for hours building castles in the air
there was an unwholesome little arbour in one dark corner much frequented by the larger black slug where i used to pass glorious afternoons making plans
i was for ever making plans and if nothing came of them what did it matter
the mere making had been a joy
to me this outoftheway corner was always a wonderful and a mysterious place where my castles in the air stood close together in radiant rows and where the strangest and most splendid adventures befell me for the hours i passed in it and the people i met in it were all enchanted
standing there and looking round with happy eyes i forgot the existence of the cousins
i could have cried for joy at being there again
it was the home of my fathers the home that would have been mine if i had been a boy the home that was mine now by a thousand tender and happy and miserable associations of which the people in possession could not dream
they were tenants but it was my home
i threw my arms round the trunk of a very wet fir tree every branch of which i remembered for had i not climbed it and fallen from it and torn and bruised myself on it uncountable numbers of times
and i gave it such a hearty kiss that my nose and chin were smudged into one green stain and still i did not care
far from caring it filled me with a reckless backfisch pleasure in being dirty a delicious feeling that i had not had for years
alice in wonderland after she had drunk the contents of the magic bottle could not have grown smaller more suddenly than i grew younger the moment i passed through that magic door
bad habits cling to us however with such persistency that i did mechanically pull out my handkerchief and begin to rub off the welcoming smudge a thing i never would have dreamed of doing in the glorious old days but an artful scent of violets clinging to the handkerchief brought me to my senses and with a sudden impulse of scorn the fine scorn for scent of every honest backfisch i rolled it up into a ball and flung it away into the bushes where i daresay it is at this moment
away with you i cried away with you symbol of conventionality of slavery of pandering to a desire to pleaseaway with you miserable little laceedged rag  and so young had i grown within the last few minutes that i did not even feel silly
as a backfisch i had never used handkerchiefsthe child of nature scorns to blow its nosethough for decencys sake my governess insisted on giving me a clean one of vast size and stubborn texture on sundays
it was stowed away unfolded in the remotest corner of my pocket where it was gradually pressed into a beautiful compactness by the other contents which were knives
after a while i remember the handkerchief being brought to light on sundays to make room for a successor and being manifestly perfectly clean we came to an agreement that it should only be changed on the first and third sundays in the month on condition that i promised to turn it on the other sundays
my governess said that the outer folds became soiled from the mere contact with the other things in my pocket and that visitors might catch sight of the soiled side if it was never turned when i wished to blow my nose in their presence and that one had no right to give ones visitors shocks
but i never do wish i began with great earnestness
unsinn said my governess cutting me short
after the first thrills of joy at being there again had gone the profound stillness of the dripping little shrubbery frightened me
it was so still that i was afraid to move so still that i could count each drop of moisture falling from the oozing wall so still that when i held my breath to listen i was deafened by my own heartbeats
i made a step forward in the direction where the arbour ought to be and the rustling and jingling of my clothes terrified me into immobility
the house was only two hundred yards off and if any one had been about the noise i had already made opening the creaking door and so foolishly apostrophising my handkerchief must have been noticed
suppose an inquiring gardener or a restless cousin should presently loom through the fog bearing down upon me
suppose fraulein wundermacher should pounce upon me suddenly from behind coming up noiselessly in her galoshes and shatter my castles with her customary triumphant fetzt halte ich dich aber fest why what was i thinking of
fraulein wundermacher so big and masterful such an enemy of daydreams such a friend of das praktische such a lover of creature comforts had died long ago had been succeeded long ago by others german sometimes and sometimes english and sometimes at intervals french and they too had all in their turn vanished and i was here a solitary ghost
come elizabeth said i to myself impatiently are you actually growing sentimental over your governesses
if you think you are a ghost be glad at least that you are a solitary one
would you like the ghosts of all those poor women you tormented to rise up now in this gloomy place against you
and do you intend to stand here till you are caught and thus exhorting myself to action and recognising how great was the risk i ran in lingering i started down the little path leading to the arbour and the principal part of the garden going it is true on tiptoe and very much frightened by the rustling of my petticoats but determined to see what i had come to see and not to be scared away by phantoms
how regretfully did i think at that moment of the petticoats of my youth so short so silent and so woollen
and how convenient the canvas shoes were with the india rubber soles for creeping about without making a sound
thanks to them i could always run swiftly and unheard into my hidingplaces and stay there listening to the garden resounding with cries of elizabeth
elizabeth
come in at once to your lessons or at a different period ou etesvous donc petite sotte  or at yet another period warte nur wenn ich dich erst habe as the voices came round one corner i whisked in my noiseless clothes round the next and it was only fraulein wundermacher a person of resource who discovered that all she needed for my successful circumvention was galoshes
she purchased a pair wasted no breath calling me and would come up silently as i stood lapped in a false security lost in the contemplation of a squirrel or a robin and seize me by the shoulders from behind to the grievous unhinging of my nerves
stealing along in the fog i looked back uneasily once or twice so vivid was this disquieting memory and could hardly be reassured by putting up my hand to the elaborate twists and curls that compose what my maid calls my frisur and that mark the gulf lying between the present and the past for it had happened once or twice awful to relate and to remember that fraulein wundermacher sooner than let me slip through her fingers had actually caught me by the long plait of hair to whose other end i was attached and whose english name i had been told was pigtail just at the instant when i was springing away from her into the bushes and so had led me home triumphant holding on tight to the rope of hair and muttering with a broad smile of special satisfaction diesmal wirst du mir aber nicht entschlupfen fraulein wundermacher now i came to think of it must have been a humourist
she was certainly a clever and a capable woman
but i wished at that moment that she would not haunt me so persistently and that i could get rid of the feeling that she was just behind in her galoshes with her hand stretched out to seize me
passing the arbour and peering into its damp recesses i started back with my heart in my mouth
i thought i saw my grandfathers stern eyes shining in the darkness
it was evident that my anxiety lest the cousins should catch me had quite upset my nerves for i am not by nature inclined to see eyes where eyes are not
dont be foolish elizabeth  murmured my soul in rather a faint voice go in and make sure but i dont like going in and making sure i replied
i did go in however with a sufficient show of courage and fortunately the eyes vanished
what i should have done if they had not i am altogether unable to imagine
ghosts are things that i laugh at in the daytime and fear at night but i think if i were to meet one i should die
the arbour had fallen into great decay and was in the last stage of mouldiness
my grandfather had had it made and like other buildings it enjoyed a period of prosperity before being left to the ravages of slugs and children when he came down every afternoon in summer and drank his coffee there and read his kreuzzeitung and dozed while the rest of us went about on tiptoe and only the birds dared sing
even the mosquitoes that infested the place were too much in awe of him to sting him they certainly never did sting him and i naturally concluded it must be because he had forbidden such familiarities
although i had played there for so many years since his death my memory skipped them all and went back to the days when it was exclusively his
standing on the spot where his armchair used to be i felt how well i knew him now from the impressions he made then on my childs mind though i was not conscious of them for more than twenty years
nobody told me about him and he died when i was six and yet within the last year or two that strange indian summer of remembrance that comes to us in the leisured times when the children have been born and we have time to think has made me know him perfectly well
it is rather an uncomfortable thought for the grownup and especially for the parent but of a salutary and restraining nature that though children may not understand what is said and done before them and have no interest in it at the time and though they may forget it at once and for years yet these things that they have seen and heard and not noticed have after all impressed themselves for ever on their minds and when they are men and women come crowding back with surprising and often painful distinctness and away frisk all the cherished little illusions in flocks
i had an awful reverence for my grandfather
he never petted and he often frowned and such people are generally reverenced
besides he was a just man everybody said a just man who might have been a great man if he had chosen and risen to almost any pinnacle of worldly glory
that he had not so chosen was held to be a convincing proof of his greatness for he was plainly too great to be great in the vulgar sense and shrouded himself in the dignity of privacy and potentialities
this at least as time passed and he still did nothing was the belief of the simple people around
people must believe in somebody and having pinned their faith on my grandfather in the promising years that lie round thirty it was more convenient to let it remain there
he pervaded our family life till my sixth year and saw to it that we all behaved ourselves and then he died and we were glad that he should be in heaven
he was a good german and when germans are good they are very good who kept the commandments voted for the government grew prize potatoes and bred innumerable sheep drove to berlin once a year with the wool in a procession of waggons behind him and sold it at the annual wollmarkt rioted soberly for a few days there and then carried most of the proceeds home hunted as often as possible helped his friends punished his children read his bible said his prayers and was genuinely astonished when his wife had the affectation to die of a broken heart
i cannot pretend to explain this conduct
she ought of course to have been happy in the possession of so good a man but good men are sometimes oppressive and to have one in the house with you and to live in the daily glare of his goodness must be a tremendous business
after bearing him seven sons and three daughters therefore my grandmother died in the way described and afforded said my grandfather another and a very curious proof of the impossibility of ever being sure of your ground with women
the incident faded more quickly from his mind than it might otherwise have done for its having occurred simultaneously with the production of a new kind of potato of which he was justly proud
he called it trost in trauer and quoted the text of scripture auge um auge zabn um zahn after which he did not again allude to his wifes decease
in his last years when my father managed the estate and he only lived with us and criticised he came to have the reputation of an oracle
the neighbours sent him their sons at the beginning of any important phase in their lives and he received them in this very arbour administering eloquent and minute advice in the deep voice that rolled round the shrubbery and filled me with a vague sense of guilt as i played
sitting among the bushes playing muffled games for fear of disturbing him i supposed he must be reading aloud so unbroken was the monotony of that majestic roll
the young men used to come out again bathed in perspiration much stung by mosquitoes and looking bewildered and when they had got over the impression made by my grandfathers speech and presence no doubt forgot all he had said with wholesome quickness and set themselves to the interesting and necessary work of gaining their own experience
once indeed a dreadful thing happened whose immediate consequence was the abrupt end to the long and close friendship between us and our nearest neighbour
his son was brought to the arbour and left there in the usual way and either he must have happened on the critical half hour after the coffee and before the kreuzzeitung when my grandfather was accustomed to sleep or he was more courageous than the others and tried to talk for very shortly playing as usual near at hand i heard my grandfathers voice raised to an extent that made me stop in my game and quake saying with deliberate anger hebe dich weg von mir sohn des satans which was all the advice this particular young man got and which he hastened to take for out he came through the bushes and though his face was very pale there was an odd twist about the corners of his mouth that reassured me
this must have happened quite at the end of my grandfathers life for almost immediately afterwards as it now seems to me he died before he need have done because he would eat crab a dish that never agreed with him in the face of his doctors warning that if he did he would surely die
what
am i to be conquered by crabs he demanded indignantly of the doctor for apart from loving them with all his heart he had never yet been conquered by anything
nay sir the combat is too unequaldo not i pray you try it again replied the doctor
but my grandfather ordered crabs that very night for supper and went in to table with the shining eyes of one who is determined to conquer or die and the crabs conquered and he died
he was a just man said the neighbours except that nearest neighbour formerly his best friend and might have been a great one had he so chosen and they buried him with profound respect and the sunshine came into our home life with a burst and the birds were not the only creatures that sang and the arbour from having been a temple of delphic utterances sank into a home for slugs
musing on the strangeness of life and on the invariable ultimate triumph of the insignificant and small over the important and vast illustrated in this instance by the easy substitution in the arbour of slugs for grandfathers i went slowly round the next bend of the path and came to the broad walk along the south side of the high wall dividing the flower garden from the kitchen garden in which sheltered position my father had had his choicest flowers
here the cousins had been at work and all the climbing roses that clothed the wall with beauty were gone and some very neat fruit trees tidily nailed up at proper intervals reigned in their stead
evidently the cousins knew the value of this warm aspect for in the border beneath filled in my fathers time in this month of november with the wallflowers that were to perfume the walk in spring there was a thick crop ofi stooped down close to make sureyes a thick crop of radishes
my eyes filled with tears at the sight of those radishes and it is probably the only occasion on record on which radishes have made anybody cry
my dear father whom i so passionately loved had in his turn passionately loved this particular border and spent the spare moments of a busy life enjoying the flowers that grew in it
he had no time himself for a more near acquaintance with the delights of gardening than directing what plants were to be used but found rest from his daily work strolling up and down here or sitting smoking as close to the flowers as possible
it is the purest of humane pleasures it is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man he would quote for he read other things besides the kreuzzeitung looking round with satisfaction on reaching this fragrant haven after a hot day in the fields
well the cousins did not think so
less fanciful and more sensible as they probably would have said their position plainly was that you cannot eat flowers
their spirits required no refreshment but their bodies needed much and therefore radishes were more precious than wallflowers
nor was my youth wholly destitute of radishes but they were grown in the decent obscurity of odd kitchen garden corners and old cucumber frames and would never have been allowed to come among the flowers
and only because i was not a boy here they were profaning the ground that used to be so beautiful
oh it was a terrible misfortune not to have been a boy
and how sad and lonely it was after all in this ghostly garden
the radish bed and what it symbolised had turned my first joy into grief
this walk and border me too much of my father reminded and of all he had been to me
what i knew of good he had taught me and what i had of happiness was through him
only once during all the years we lived together had we been of different opinions and fallen out and it was the one time i ever saw him severe
i was four years old and demanded one sunday to be taken to church
my father said no for i had never been to church and the german service is long and exhausting
i implored
he again said no
i implored again and showed such a pious disposition and so earnest a determination to behave well that he gave in and we went off very happily hand in hand
now mind elizabeth he said turning to me at the church door there is no coming out again in the middle
having insisted on being brought thou shalt now sit patiently till the end oh yes oh yes i promised eagerly and went in filled with holy fire
the shortness of my legs hanging helplessly for two hours midway between the seat and the floor was the weapon chosen by satan for my destruction
in german churches you do not kneel and seldom stand but sit nearly the whole time praying and singing in great comfort
if you are four years old however this unchanged position soon becomes one of torture
unknown and dreadful things go on in your legs strange prickings and tinglings and dartings up and down a sudden terrifying numbness when you think they must have dropped off but are afraid to look then renewed and fiercer prickings shootings and burnings
i thought i must be very ill for i had never known my legs like that before
my father sitting beside me was engrossed in the singing of a chorale that evidently had no end each verse finished with a longdrawnout hallelujah after which the organ played by itself for a hundred yearsby the organists watch which was wrong two minutes exactlyand then another verse began
my father being the patron of the living was careful to sing and pray and listen to the sermon with exemplary attention aware that every eye in the little church was on our pew and at first i tried to imitate him but the behaviour of my legs became so alarming that after vainly casting imploring glances at him and seeing that he continued his singing unmoved i put out my hand and pulled his sleeve
hallelujah sang my father with deliberation continuing in a low voice without changing the expression of his face his lips hardly moving and his eyes fixed abstractedly on the ceiling till the organist who was also the postman should have finished his solo did i not tell thee to sit still elizabeth yes but then do it  but i want to go home  unsinn and the next verse beginning my father sang louder than ever
what could i do
should i cry
i began to be afraid i was going to die on that chair so extraordinary were the sensations in my legs
what could my father do to me if i did cry
with the quick instinct of small children i felt that he could not put me in the corner in church nor would he whip me in public and that with the whole village looking on he was helpless and would have to give in
therefore i tugged his sleeve again and more peremptorily and prepared to demand my immediate removal in a loud voice
but my father was ready for me
without interrupting his singing or altering his devout expression he put his hand slowly down and gave me a hard pinchnot a playful pinch but a good hard unmistakeable pinch such as i had never imagined possible and then went on serenely to the next hallelujah
for a moment i was petrified with astonishment
was this my indulgent father my playmate adorer and friend
smarting with pain for i was a round baby with a nicely stretched tight skin and dreadfully hurt in my feelings i opened my mouth to shriek in earnest when my fathers clear whisper fell on my ear each word distinct and not to be misunderstood his eyes as before gazing meditatively into space and his lips hardly moving elizabeth wenn du schreist kneife ich dich bis du platzt and he finished the verse with unruffled decorum      will satan mich verschlingen      so lass die engel singen                  hallelujah  we never had another difference
up to then he had been my willing slave and after that i was his
with a smile and a shiver i turned from the border and its memories to the door in the wall leading to the kitchen garden in a corner of which my own little garden used to be
the door was open and i stood still a moment before going through to hold my breath and listen
the silence was as profound as before
the place seemed deserted and i should have thought the house empty and shut up but for the carefully tended radishes and the recent footmarks on the green of the path
they were the footmarks of a child
i was stooping down to examine a specially clear one when the loud caw of a very bored looking crow sitting on the wall just above my head made me jump as i have seldom in my life jumped and reminded me that i was trespassing
clearly my nerves were all to pieces for i gathered up my skirts and fled through the door as though a whole army of ghosts and cousins were at my heels nor did i stop till i had reached the remote corner where my garden was
are you enjoying yourself elizabeth asked the mocking sprite that calls itself my soul but i was too much out of breath to answer
this was really a very safe corner
it was separated from the main garden and the house by the wall and shut in on the north side by an orchard and it was to the last degree unlikely that any one would come there on such an afternoon
this plot of ground turned now as i saw into a rockery had been the scene of my most untiring labours
into the cold earth of this north border on which the sun never shone i had dug my brightest hopes
all my pocket money had been spent on it and as bulbs were dear and my weekly allowance small in a fatal hour i had borrowed from fraulein wundermacher selling her my independence passing utterly into her power forced as a result till my next birthday should come round to an unnatural suavity of speech and manner in her company against which my very soul revolted
and after all nothing came up
the labour of digging and watering the anxious zeal with which i pounced on weeds the poring over gardening books the plans made as i sat on the little seat in the middle gazing admiringly and with the eye of faith on the trim surface so soon to be gemmed with a thousand flowers the reckless expenditure of pfennings the humiliation of my position in regard to fraulein wundermacherall all had been in vain
no sun shone there and nothing grew
the gardener who reigned supreme in those days had given me this big piece for that sole reason because he could do nothing with it himself
he was no doubt of opinion that it was quite good enough for a child to experiment upon and went his way when i had thanked him with a profuseness of gratitude i still remember with an unmoved countenance
for more than a year i worked and waited and watched the career of the flourishing orchard opposite with puzzled feelings
the orchard was only a few yards away and yet although my garden was full of manure and water and attentions that were never bestowed on the orchard all it could show and ever did show were a few unhappy beginnings of growth that either remained stationary and did not achieve flowers or dwindled down again and vanished
once i timidly asked the gardener if he could explain these signs and wonders but he was a busy man with no time for answering questions and told me shortly that gardening was not learned in a day
how well i remember that afternoon and the very shape of the lazy clouds and the smell of spring things and myself going away abashed and sitting on the shaky bench in my domain and wondering for the hundredth time what it was that made the difference between my bit and the bit of orchard in front of me
the fruit trees far enough away from the wall to be beyond the reach of its cold shade were tossing their flowerladen heads in the sunshine in a carelessly wellsatisfied fashion that filled my heart with envy
there was a rise in the field behind them and at the foot of its protecting slope they luxuriated in the insolent glory of their white and pink perfection
it was may and my heart bled at the thought of the tulips i had put in in november and that i had never seen since
the whole of the rest of the garden was on fire with tulips behind me on the other side of the wall were rows and rows of themcups of translucent loveliness a jewelled ring flung right round the lawn
but what was there not on the other side of that wall
things came up there and grew and flowered exactly as my gardening books said they should do and in front of me in the gay orchard things that nobody ever troubled about or cultivated or noticed throve joyously beneath the treesdaffodils thrusting their spears through the grass crocuses peeping out inquiringly snowdrops uncovering their small cold faces when the first shivering spring days came
only my piece that i so loved was perpetually ugly and empty
and i sat in it thinking of these things on that radiant day and wept aloud
then an apprentice came by a youth who had often seen me busily digging and noticing the unusual tears and struck perhaps by the difference between my garden and the profusion of splendour all around paused with his barrow on the path in front of me and remarked that nobody could expect to get blood out of a stone
the apparent irrelevance of this statement made me weep still louder the bitter tears of insulted sorrow but he stuck to his point and harangued me from the path explaining the connection between north walls and tulips and blood and stones till my tears all dried up again and i listened attentively for the conclusion to be drawn from his remarks was plainly that i had been shamefully taken in by the head gardener who was an unprincipled person thenceforward to be for ever mistrusted and shunned
standing on the path from which the kindly apprentice had expounded his proverb this scene rose before me as clearly as though it had taken place that very day but how different everything looked and how it had shrunk
was this the wide orchard that had seemed to stretch away it and the sloping field beyond up to the gates of heaven
i believe nearly every child who is much alone goes through a certain time of hourly expecting the day of judgment and i had made up my mind that on that day the heavenly host would enter the world by that very field coming down the slope in shining ranks treading the daffodils under foot filling the orchard with their songs of exultation joyously seeking out the sheep from among the goats
of course i was a sheep and my governess and the head gardener goats so that the results could not fail to be in every way satisfactory
but looking up at the slope and remembering my visions i laughed at the smallness of the field i had supposed would hold all heaven
here again the cousins had been at work
the site of my garden was occupied by a rockery and the orchard grass with all its treasures had been dug up and the spaces between the trees planted with currant bushes and celery in admirable rows so that no future little cousins will be able to dream of celestial hosts coming towards them across the fields of daffodils and will perhaps be the better for being free from visions of the kind for as i grew older uncomfortable doubts laid hold of my heart with cold fingers dim uncertainties as to the exact ultimate position of the gardener and the governess anxious questionings as to how it would be if it were they who turned out after all to be sheep and i who
for that we all three might be gathered into the same fold at the last never in those days struck me as possible and if it had i should not have liked it
now what sort of person can that be i asked myself shaking my head as i contemplated the changes before me who could put a rockery among vegetables and currant bushes
a rockery of all things in the gardening world needs consummate tact in its treatment
it is easier to make mistakes in forming a rockery than in any other garden scheme
either it is a great success or it is great failure either it is very charming or it is very absurd
there is no state between the sublime and the ridiculous possible in a rockery i stood shaking my head disapprovingly at the rockery before me lost in these reflections when a sudden quick pattering of feet coming along in a great hurry made me turn round with a start just in time to receive the shock of a body tumbling out of the mist and knocking violently against me
it was a little girl of about twelve years old
hullo said the little girl in excellent english and then we stared at each other in astonishment
i thought you were miss robinson said the little girl offering no apology for having nearly knocked me down
who are you  miss robinson
miss robinson i repeated my eyes fixed on the little girls face and a host of memories stirring within me
why didnt she marry a missionary and go out to some place where they ate him  the little girl stared harder
ate him
marry
what has she been married all this time to somebody whos been eaten and never let on
oh i say what a game and she threw back her head and laughed till the garden rang again
o hush you dreadful little girl i implored catching her by the arm and terrified beyond measure by the loudness of her mirth
dont make that horrid noisewe are certain to be caught if you dont stop  the little girl broke off a shriek of laughter in the middle and shut her mouth with a snap
her eyes round and black and shiny like boot buttons came still further out of her head
caught she said eagerly
what are you afraid of being caught too
well this is a game and with her hands plunged deep in the pockets of her coat she capered in front of me in the excess of her enjoyment reminding me of a very fat black lamb frisking round the dazed and passive sheep its mother
it was clear that the time had come for me to get down to the gate at the end of the garden as quickly as possible and i began to move away in that direction
the little girl at once stopped capering and planted herself squarely in front of me
who are you she said examining me from my hat to my boots with the keenest interest
i considered this ungarnished manner of asking questions impertinent and trying to look lofty made an attempt to pass at the side
the little girl with a quick corklike movement was there before me
who are you she repeated her expression friendly but firm
oh iim a pilgrim i said in desperation
a pilgrim echoed the little girl
she seemed struck and while she was struck i slipped past her and began to walk quickly towards the door in the wall
a pilgrim said the little girl again keeping close beside me and looking me up and down attentively
i dont like pilgrims
arent they people who are always walking about and have things the matter with their feet
have you got anything the matter with your feet  certainly not i replied indignantly walking still faster
and they never wash miss robinson says
you dont either do you  not wash
oh im afraid you are a very badly broughtup little girloh leave me alonei must run  so must i said the little girl cheerfully for miss robinson must be close behind us
she nearly had me just before i found you and she started running by my side
the thought of miss robinson close behind us gave wings to my feet and casting my dignity of which indeed there was but little left to the winds i fairly flew down the path
the little girl was not to be outrun and though she panted and turned weird colours kept by my side and even talked
oh i was tired tired in body and mind tired by the different shocks i had received tired by the journey tired by the want of food and here i was being forced to run because this very naughty little girl chose to hide instead of going in to her lessons
i saythis is jolly she jerked out
but why need we run to the same place i breathlessly asked in the vain hope of getting rid of her
oh yesthats justthe fun
wed get ontogetheryou and i  no no said i decided on this point bewildered though i was
i cant stand washingeitherits awfulin winterand makes one havechaps  but i dont mind it in the least i protested faintly not having any energy left
oh i say said the little girl looking at my face and making the sound known as a guffaw
the familiarity of this little girl was wholly revolting
we had got safely through the door round the corner past the radishes and were in the shrubbery
i knew from experience how easy it was to hide in the tangle of little paths and stopped a moment to look round and listen
the little girl opened her mouth to speak
with great presence of mind i instantly put my muff in front of it and held it there tight while i listened
dead silence except for the laboured breathing and struggles of the little girl
i dont hear a sound i whispered letting her go again
now what did you want to say i added eyeing her severely
i wanted to say she panted that its no good pretending you wash with a nose like that  a nose like that
a nose like what i exclaimed greatly offended and though i put up my hand and very tenderly and carefully felt it i could find no difference in it
i am afraid poor miss robinson must have a wretched life i said in tones of deep disgust
the little girl smiled fatuously as though i were paying her compliments
its all green and brown she said pointing
is it always like that  then i remembered the wet fir tree near the gate and the enraptured kiss it had received and blushed
wont it come off persisted the little girl
of course it will come off i answered frowning
why dont you rub it off  then i remembered the throwing away of the handkerchief and blushed again
please lend me your handkerchief i said humbly ii have lost mine  there was a great fumbling in six different pockets and then a handkerchief that made me young again merely to look at it was produced
i took it thankfully and rubbed with energy the little girl intensely interested watching the operation and giving me advice
thereits all right nowa little more on the righttherenow its all off  are you sure
no green left i anxiously asked
no its red all over now she replied cheerfully
let me get home  thought i very much upset by this information let me get home to my dear uncritical admiring babies who accept my nose as an example of what a nose should be and whatever its colour think it beautiful and thrusting the handkerchief back into the little girls hands i hurried away down the path
she packed it away hastily but it took some seconds for it was of the size of a small sheet and then came running after me
where are you going she asked surprised as i turned down the path leading to the gate
through this gate i replied with decision
but you mustntwere not allowed to go through there  so strong was the force of old habits in that place that at the words not allowed my hand dropped of itself from the latch and at that instant a voice calling quite close to us through the mist struck me rigid
elizabeth
elizabeth called the voice come in at once to your lessonselizabeth
elizabeth  its miss robinson whispered the little girl twinkling with excitement then catching sight of my face she said once more with eager insistence who are you  oh im a ghost i cried with conviction pressing my hands to my forehead and looking round fearfully
pooh said the little girl
it was the last remark i heard her make for there was a creaking of approaching boots in the bushes and seized by a frightful panic i pulled the gate open with one desperate pull flung it to behind me and fled out and away down the wide misty fields
the gotha almanach says that the reigning cousin married the daughter of a mr johnstone an englishman in  and that in  their only child was born elizabeth
november thlast night we had ten degrees of frost fahrenheit and i went out the first thing this morning to see what had become of the tearoses and behold they were wide awake and quite cheerfulcovered with rime it is true but anything but black and shrivelled
even those in boxes on each side of the verandah steps were perfectly alive and full of buds and one in particular a bouquet dor is a mass of buds and would flower if it could get the least encouragement
i am beginning to think that the tenderness of tearoses is much exaggerated and am certainly very glad i had the courage to try them in this northern garden
but i must not fly too boldly in the face of providence and have ordered those in the boxes to be taken into the greenhouse for the winter and hope the bouquet dor in a sunny place near the glass may be induced to open some of those buds
the greenhouse is only used as a refuge and kept at a temperature just above freezing and is reserved entirely for such plants as cannot stand the very coldest part of the winter out of doors
i dont use it for growing anything because i dont love things that will only bear the garden for three or four months in the year and require coaxing and petting for the rest of it
give me a garden full of strong healthy creatures able to stand roughness and cold without dismally giving in and dying
i never could see that delicacy of constitution is pretty either in plants or women
no doubt there are many lovely flowers to be had by heat and constant coaxing but then for each of these there are fifty others still lovelier that will gratefully grow in gods wholesome air and are blessed in return with a far greater intensity of scent and colour
we have been very busy till now getting the permanent beds into order and planting the new tearoses and i am looking forward to next summer with more hope than ever in spite of my many failures
i wish the years would pass quickly that will bring my garden to perfection
the persian yellows have gone into their new quarters and their place is occupied by the tearose safrano all the rose beds are carpeted with pansies sown in july and transplanted in october each bed having a separate colour
the purple ones are the most charming and go well with every rose but i have white ones with laurette messimy and yellow ones with safrano and a new red sort in the big centre bed of red roses
round the semicircle on the south side of the little privet hedge two rows of annual larkspurs in all their delicate shades have been sown and just beyond the larkspurs on the grass is a semicircle of standard tea and pillar roses
in front of the house the long borders have been stocked with larkspurs annual and perennial columbines giant poppies pinks madonna lilies wallflowers hollyhocks perennial phloxes peonies lavender starworts cornflowers lychnis chalcedonica and bulbs packed in wherever bulbs could go
these are the borders that were so hardly used by the other gardener
the spring boxes for the verandah steps have been filled with pink and white and yellow tulips
i love tulips better than any other spring flower they are the embodiment of alert cheerfulness and tidy grace and next to a hyacinth look like a wholesome freshly tubbed young girl beside a stout lady whose every movement weighs down the air with patchouli
their faint delicate scent is refinement itself and is there anything in the world more charming than the sprightly way they hold up their little faces to the sun
i have heard them called bold and flaunting but to me they seem modest grace itself only always on the alert to enjoy life as much as they can and not afraid of looking the sun or anything else above them in the face
on the grass there are two beds of them carpeted with forgetmenots and in the grass in scattered groups are daffodils and narcissus
down the wilder shrubbery walks foxgloves and mulleins will i hope shine majestic and one cool corner backed by a group of firs is graced by madonna lilies white foxgloves and columbines
in a distant glade i have made a spring garden round an oak tree that stands alone in the sungroups of crocuses daffodils narcissus hyacinths and tulips among such flowering shrubs and trees as pirus malus spectabilis floribunda and coronaria prunus juliana mahaleb serotina triloba and pissardi cydonias and weigelias in every colour and several kinds of crataegus and other may lovelinesses
if the weather behaves itself nicely and we get gentle rains in due season i think this little corner will be beautifulbut what a big if it is
drought is our great enemy and the two last summers each contained five weeks of blazing cloudless heat when all the ditches dried up and the soil was like hot pastry
at such times the watering is naturally quite beyond the strength of two men but as a garden is a place to be happy in and not one where you want to meet a dozen curious eyes at every turn i should not like to have more than these two or rather one and a halfthe assistant having storklike proclivities and going home in the autumn to his native russia returning in the spring with the first warm winds
i want to keep him over the winter as there is much to be done even then and i sounded him on the point the other day
he is the most abjectlooking of human beingslame and afflicted with a hideous eyedisease but he is a good worker and plods along unwearyingly from sunrise to dusk
pray my good stork said i or german words to that effect why dont you stay here altogether instead of going home and rioting away all you have earned  i would stay he answered but i have my wife there in russia  your wife i exclaimed stupidly surprised that the poor deformed creature should have found a mateas though there were not a superfluity of mates in the worldi didnt know you were married  yes and i have two little children and i dont know what they would do if i were not to come home
but it is a very expensive journey to russia and costs me every time seven marks  seven marks  yes it is a great sum  i wondered whether i should be able to get to russia for seven marks supposing i were to be seized with an unnatural craving to go there
all the labourers who work here from march to december are russians and poles or a mixture of both
we send a man over who can speak their language to fetch as many as he can early in the year and they arrive with their bundles men and women and babies and as soon as they have got here and had their fares paid they disappear in the night if they get the chance sometimes fifty of them at a time to go and work singly or in couples for the peasants who pay them a pfenning or two more a day than we do and let them eat with the family
from us they get a mark and a half to two marks a day and as many potatoes as they can eat
the women get less not because they work less but because they are women and must not be encouraged
the overseer lives with them and has a loaded revolver in his pocket and a savage dog at his heels
for the first week or two after their arrival the foresters and other permanent officials keep guard at night over the houses they are put into
i suppose they find it sleepy work for certain it is that spring after spring the same thing happens fifty of them getting away in spite of all our precautions and we are left with our mouths open and much out of pocket
this spring by some mistake they arrived without their bundles which had gone astray on the road and as they travel in their best clothes they refused utterly to work until their luggage came
nearly a week was lost waiting to the despair of all in authority
nor will any persuasions induce them to do anything on saints days and there surely never was a church so full of them as the russian church
in the spring when every hour is of vital importance the work is constantly being interrupted by them and the workers lie sleeping in the sun the whole day agreeably conscious that they are pleasing themselves and the church at one and the same timea state of perfection as rare as it is desirable
reason unaided by faith is of course exasperated at this waste of precious time and i confess that during the first mild days after the long winter frost when it is possible to begin to work the ground i have sympathised with the gloom of the man of wrath confronted in one week by two or three empty days on which no man will labour and have listened in silence to his remarks about distant russian saints
i suppose it was my own superfluous amount of civilisation that made me pity these people when first i came to live among them
they herd together like animals and do the work of animals but in spite of the armed overseer the dirt and the rags the meals of potatoes washed down by weak vinegar and water i am beginning to believe that they would strongly object to soap i am sure they would not wear new clothes and i hear them coming home from their work at dusk singing
they are like little children or animals in their utter inability to grasp the idea of a future and after all if you work all day in gods sunshine when evening comes you are pleasantly tired and ready for rest and not much inclined to find fault with your lot
i have not yet persuaded myself however that the women are happy
they have to work as hard as the men and get less for it they have to produce offspring quite regardless of times and seasons and the general fitness of things they have to do this as expeditiously as possible so that they may not unduly interrupt the work in hand nobody helps them notices them or cares about them least of all the husband
it is quite a usual thing to see them working in the fields in the morning and working again in the afternoon having in the interval produced a baby
the baby is left to an old woman whose duty it is to look after babies collectively
when i expressed my horror at the poor creatures working immediately afterwards as though nothing had happened the man of wrath informed me that they did not suffer because they had never worn corsets nor had their mothers and grandmothers
we were riding together at the time and had just passed a batch of workers and my husband was speaking to the overseer when a woman arrived alone and taking up a spade began to dig
she grinned cheerfully at us as she made a curtesy and the overseer remarked that she had just been back to the house and had a baby
poor poor woman i cried as we rode on feeling for some occult reason very angry with the man of wrath
and her wretched husband doesnt care a rap and will probably beat her tonight if his supper isnt right
what nonsense it is to talk about the equality of the sexes when the women have the babies  quite so my dear replied the man of wrath smiling condescendingly
you have got to the very root of the matter
nature while imposing this agreeable duty on the woman weakens her and disables her for any serious competition with man
how can a person who is constantly losing a year of the best part of her life compete with a young man who never loses any time at all
he has the brute force and his last word on any subject could always be his fist  i said nothing
it was a dull gray afternoon in the beginning of november and the leaves dropped slowly and silently at our horses feet as we rode towards the hirschwald
it is a universal custom proceeded the man of wrath amongst these russians and i believe amongst the lower classes everywhere and certainly commendable on the score of simplicity to silence a womans objections and aspirations by knocking her down
i have heard it said that this apparently brutal action has anything but the maddening effect tenderly nurtured persons might suppose and that the patient is soothed and satisfied with a rapidity and completeness unattainable by other and more polite methods
do you suppose he went on flicking a twig off a tree with his whip as we passed that the intellectual husband wrestling intellectually with the chaotic yearnings of his intellectual wife ever achieves the result aimed at
he may and does go on wrestling till he is tired but never does he in the very least convince her of her folly while his brother in the ragged coat has got through the whole business in less time than it takes me to speak about it
there is no doubt that these poor women fulfil their vocation far more thoroughly than the women in our class and as the truest happiness consists in finding ones vocation quickly and continuing in it all ones days i consider they are to be envied rather than not since they are early taught by the impossibility of argument with marital muscle the impotence of female endeavour and the blessings of content  pray go on i said politely
these women accept their beatings with a simplicity worthy of all praise and far from considering themselves insulted admire the strength and energy of the man who can administer such eloquent rebukes
in russia not only may a man beat his wife but it is laid down in the catechism and taught all boys at the time of confirmation as necessary at least once a week whether she has done anything or not for the sake of her general health and happiness  i thought i observed a tendency in the man of wrath rather to gloat over these castigations
pray my dear man i said pointing with my whip look at that baby moon so innocently peeping at us over the edge of the mist just behind that silver birch and dont talk so much about women and things you dont understand
what is the use of your bothering about fists and whips and muscles and all the dreadful things invented for the confusion of obstreperous wives
you know you are a civilised husband and a civilised husband is a creature who has ceased to be a man
and a civilised wife he asked bringing his horse close up beside me and putting his arm round my waist has she ceased to be a woman  i should think so indeedshe is a goddess and can never be worshipped and adored enough  it seems to me he said that the conversation is growing personal  i started off at a canter across the short springy turf
the hirschwald is an enchanted place on such an evening when the mists lie low on the turf and overhead the delicate bare branches of the silver birches stand out clear against the soft sky while the little moon looks down kindly on the damp november world
where the trees thicken into a wood the fragrance of the wet earth and rotting leaves kicked up by the horses hoofs fills my soul with delight
i particularly love that smellit brings before me the entire benevolence of nature for ever working death and decay so piteous in themselves into the means of fresh life and glory and sending up sweet odours as she works
december thi have been to england
i went for at least a month and stayed a week in a fog and was blown home again in a gale
twice i fled before the fogs into the country to see friends with gardens but it was raining and except the beautiful lawns not to be had in the fatherland and the infinite possibilities there was nothing to interest the intelligent and gardenloving foreigner for the good reason that you cannot be interested in gardens under an umbrella
so i went back to the fogs and after groping about for a few days more began to long inordinately for germany
a terrific gale sprang up after i had started and the journey both by sea and land was full of horrors the trains in germany being heated to such an extent that it is next to impossible to sit still great gusts of hot air coming up under the cushions the cushions themselves being very hot and the wretched traveller still hotter
but when i reached my home and got out of the train into the purest brightest snowatmosphere the air so still that the whole world seemed to be listening the sky cloudless the crisp snow sparkling underfoot and on the trees and a happy row of three beaming babies awaiting me i was consoled for all my torments only remembering them enough to wonder why i had gone away at all
the babies each had a kitten in one hand and an elegant bouquet of pine needles and grass in the other and what with the due presentation of the bouquets and the struggles of the kittens the hugging and kissing was much interfered with
kittens bouquets and babies were all somehow squeezed into the sleigh and off we went with jingling bells and shrieks of delight
directly you comes home the fun begins said the may baby sitting very close to me
how the snow purrs cried the april baby as the horses scrunched it up with their feet
the june baby sat loudly singing the king of love my shepherd is and swinging her kitten round by its tail to emphasise the rhythm
the house halfburied in the snow looked the very abode of peace and i ran through all the rooms eager to take possession of them again and feeling as though i had been away for ever
when i got to the library i came to a standstillah the dear room what happy times i have spent in it rummaging amongst the books making plans for my garden building castles in the air writing dreaming doing nothing
there was a big peat fire blazing half up the chimney and the old housekeeper had put pots of flowers about and on the writingtable was a great bunch of violets scenting the room
oh how good it is to be home again i sighed in my satisfaction
the babies clung about my knees looking up at me with eyes full of love
outside the dazzling snow and sunshine inside the bright room and happy facesi thought of those yellow fogs and shivered
the library is not used by the man of wrath it is neutral ground where we meet in the evenings for an hour before he disappears into his own roomsa series of very smoky dens in the southeast corner of the house
it looks i am afraid rather too gay for an ideal library and its colouring white and yellow is so cheerful as to be almost frivolous
there are white bookcases all round the walls and there is a great fireplace and four windows facing full south opening on to my most cherished bit of garden the bit round the sundial so that with so much colour and such a big fire and such floods of sunshine it has anything but a sober air in spite of the venerable volumes filling the shelves
indeed i should never be surprised if they skipped down from their places and picking up their leaves began to dance
with this room to live in i can look forward with perfect equanimity to being snowed up for any time providence thinks proper and to go into the garden in its snowedup state is like going into a bath of purity
the first breath on opening the door is so ineffably pure that it makes me gasp and i feel a black and sinful object in the midst of all the spotlessness
yesterday i sat out of doors near the sundial the whole afternoon with the thermometer so many degrees below freezing that it will be weeks finding its way up again but there was no wind and beautiful sunshine and i was well wrapped up in furs
i even had tea brought out there to the astonishment of the menials and sat till long after the sun had set enjoying the frosty air
i had to drink the tea very quickly for it showed a strong inclination to begin to freeze
after the sun had gone down the rooks came home to their nests in the garden with a great fuss and fluttering and many hesitations and squabbles before they settled on their respective trees
they flew over my head in hundreds with a mighty swish of wings and when they had arranged themselves comfortably an intense hush fell upon the garden and the house began to look like a christmas card with its white roof against the clear pale green of the western sky and lamplight shining in the windows
i had been reading a life of luther lent me by our parson in the intervals between looking round me and being happy
he came one day with the book and begged me to read it having discovered that my interest in luther was not as living as it ought to be so i took it out with me into the garden because the dullest book takes on a certain saving grace if read out of doors just as bread and butter devoid of charm in the drawingroom is ambrosia eaten under a tree
i read luther all the afternoon with pauses for refreshing glances at the garden and the sky and much thankfulness in my heart
his struggles with devils amazed me and i wondered whether such a day as that full of grace and the forgiveness of sins never struck him as something to make him relent even towards devils
he apparently never allowed himself just to be happy
he was a wonderful man but i am glad i was not his wife
our parson is an interesting person and untiring in his efforts to improve himself
both he and his wife study whenever they have a spare moment and there is a tradition that she stirs her puddings with one hand and holds a latin grammar in the other the grammar of course getting the greater share of her attention
to most german hausfraus the dinners and the puddings are of paramount importance and they pride themselves on keeping those parts of their houses that are seen in a state of perpetual and spotless perfection and this is exceedingly praiseworthy but i would humbly inquire are there not other things even more important
and is not plain living and high thinking better than the other way about
and all too careful making of dinners and dusting of furniture takes a terrible amount of precious time andand with shame i confess that my sympathies are all with the pudding and the grammar
it cannot be right to be the slave of ones household gods and i protest that if my furniture ever annoyed me by wanting to be dusted when i wanted to be doing something else and there was no one to do the dusting for me i would cast it all into the nearest bonfire and sit and warm my toes at the flames with great contentment triumphantly selling my dusters to the very next pedlar who was weak enough to buy them
parsons wives have to do the housework and cooking themselves and are thus not only cooks and housemaids but if they have childrenand they always do have childrenthey are head and under nurse as well and besides these trifling duties have a good deal to do with their fruit and vegetable garden and everything to do with their poultry
this being so is it not pathetic to find a young woman bravely struggling to learn languages and keep up with her husband
if i were that husband those puddings would taste sweetest to me that were served with latin sauce
they are both severely pious and are for ever engaged in desperate efforts to practise what they preach than which as we all know nothing is more difficult
he works in his parish with the most noble selfdevotion and never loses courage although his efforts have been several times rewarded by disgusting libels pasted up on the streetcorners thrown under doors and even fastened to his own garden wall
the peasant hereabouts is past belief low and animal and a sensitive intellectual parson among them is really a pearl before swine
for years he has gone on unflinchingly filled with the most living faith and hope and charity and i sometimes wonder whether they are any better now in his parish than they were under his predecessor a man who smoked and drank beer from monday morning to saturday night never did a stroke of work and often kept the scanty congregation waiting on sunday afternoons while he finished his postprandial nap
it is discouraging enough to make most men give in and leave the parish to get to heaven or not as it pleases but he never seems discouraged and goes on sacrificing the best part of his life to these people when all his tastes are literary and all his inclinations towards the life of the student
his convictions drag him out of his little home at all hours to minister to the sick and exhort the wicked they give him no rest and never let him feel he has done enough and when he comes home weary after a days wrestling with his parishioners souls he is confronted on his doorstep by filthy abuse pasted up on his own front door
he never speaks of these things but how shall they be hid
everybody here knows everything that happens before the day is over and what we have for dinner is of far greater general interest than the most astounding political earthquake
they have a pretty roomy cottage and a good bit of ground adjoining the churchyard
his predecessor used to hang out his washing on the tombstones to dry but then he was a person entirely lost to all sense of decency and had finally to be removed preaching a farewell sermon of a most vituperative description and hurling invective at the man of wrath who sat up in his box drinking in every word and enjoying himself thoroughly
the man of wrath likes novelty and such a sermon had never been heard before
it is spoken of in the village to this day with bated breath and awful joy
december ndup to now we have had a beautiful winter
clear skies frost little wind and except for a sharp touch now and then very few really cold days
my windows are gay with hyacinths and lilies of the valley and though as i have said i dont admire the smell of hyacinths in the spring when it seems wanting in youth and chastity next to that of other flowers i am glad enough now to bury my nose in their heavy sweetness
in december one cannot afford to be fastidious besides one is actually less fastidious about everything in the winter
the keen air braces soul as well as body into robustness and the food and the perfume disliked in the summer are perfectly welcome then
i am very busy preparing for christmas but have often locked myself up in a room alone shutting out my unfinished duties to study the flower catalogues and make my lists of seeds and shrubs and trees for the spring
it is a fascinating occupation and acquires an additional charm when you know you ought to be doing something else that christmas is at the door that children and servants and farm hands depend on you for their pleasure and that if you dont see to the decoration of the trees and house and the buying of the presents nobody else will
the hours fly by shut up with those catalogues and with duty snarling on the other side of the door
i dont like dutyeverything in the least disagreeable is always sure to be ones duty
why cannot it be my duty to make lists and plans for the dear garden
and so it is i insisted to the man of wrath when he protested against what he called wasting my time upstairs
no he replied sagely your garden is not your duty because it is your pleasure  what a comfort it is to have such wells of wisdom constantly at my disposal
anybody can have a husband but to few is it given to have a sage and the combination of both is as rare as it is useful
indeed in its practical utility the only thing i ever saw to equal it is a sofa my neighbour has bought as a christmas surprise for her husband and which she showed me the last time i called therea beautiful invention as she explained combining a bedstead a sofa and a chest of drawers and into which you put your clothes and on top of which you put yourself and if anybody calls in the middle of the night and you happen to be using the drawingroom as a bedroom you just pop the bedclothes inside and there you are discovered sitting on your sofa and looking for all the world as though you had been expecting visitors for hours
pray does he wear pyjamas i inquired
but she had never heard of pyjamas
it takes a long time to make my spring lists
i want to have a border all yellow every shade of yellow from fieriest orange to nearly white and the amount of work and studying of gardening books it costs me will only be appreciated by beginners like myself
i have been weeks planning it and it is not nearly finished
i want it to be a succession of glories from may till the frosts and the chief feature is to be the number of ardent marigoldsflowers that i very tenderly loveand nasturtiums
the nasturtiums are to be of every sort and shade and are to climb and creep and grow in bushes and show their lovely flowers and leaves to the best advantage
then there are to be eschscholtzias dahlias sunflowers zinnias scabiosa portulaca yellow violas yellow stocks yellow sweetpeas yellow lupinseverything that is yellow or that has a yellow variety
the place i have chosen for it is a long wide border in the sun at the foot of a grassy slope crowned with lilacs and pines and facing southeast
you go through a little pine wood and turning a corner are to come suddenly upon this bit of captured morning glory
i want it to be blinding in its brightness after the dark cool path through the wood
that is the idea
depression seizes me when i reflect upon the probable difference between the idea and its realisation
i am ignorant and the gardener is i do believe still more so for he was forcing some tulips and they have all shrivelled up and died and he says he cannot imagine why
besides he is in love with the cook and is going to marry her after christmas and refuses to enter into any of my plans with the enthusiasm they deserve but sits with vacant eye dreamily chopping wood from morning till night to keep the beloved ones kitchen fire well supplied
i cannot understand any one preferring cooks to marigolds those future marigolds shadowy as they are and whose seeds are still sleeping at the seedsmans have shone through my winter days like golden lamps
i wish with all my heart i were a man for of course the first thing i should do would be to buy a spade and go and garden and then i should have the delight of doing everything for my flowers with my own hands and need not waste time explaining what i want done to somebody else
it is dull work giving orders and trying to describe the bright visions of ones brain to a person who has no visions and no brain and who thinks a yellow bed should be calceolarias edged with blue
i have taken care in choosing my yellow plants to put down only those humble ones that are easily pleased and grateful for little for my soil is by no means all that it might be and to most plants the climate is rather trying
i feel really grateful to any flower that is sturdy and willing enough to flourish here
pansies seem to like the place and so do sweetpeas pinks dont and after much coaxing gave hardly any flowers last summer
nearly all the roses were a success in spite of the sandy soil except the tearose adam which was covered with buds ready to open when they suddenly turned brown and died and three standard dr grills which stood in a row and simply sulked
i had been very excited about dr
grill his description in the catalogues being specially fascinating and no doubt i deserved the snubbing i got
never be excited my dears about anything shall be the advice i will give the three babies when the time comes to take them out to parties or if you are dont show it
if by nature you are volcanoes at least be only smouldering ones
dont look pleased dont look interested dont above all things look eager
calm indifference should be written on every feature of your faces
never show that you like any one person or any one thing
be cool languid and reserved
if you dont do as your mother tells you and are just gushing frisky young idiots snubs will be your portion
if you do as she tells you youll marry princes and live happily ever after  dr
grill must be a german rose
in this part of the world the more you are pleased to see a person the less is he pleased to see you whereas if you are disagreeable he will grow pleasant visibly his countenance expanding into wider amiability the more your own is stiff and sour
but i was not prepared for that sort of thing in a rose and was disgusted with dr
grill
he had the best place in the gardenwarm sunny and sheltered his holes were prepared with the tenderest care he was given the most dainty mixture of compost clay and manure he was watered assiduously all through the drought when more willing flowers got nothing and he refused to do anything but look black and shrivel
he did not die but neither did he livehe just existed and at the end of the summer not one of him had a scrap more shoot or leaf than when he was first put in in april
it would have been better if he had died straight away for then i should have known what to do as it is there he is still occupying the best place wrapped up carefully for the winter excluding kinder roses and probably intending to repeat the same conduct next year
well trials are the portion of mankind and gardeners have their share and in any case it is better to be tried by plants than persons seeing that with plants you know that it is you who are in the wrong and with persons it is always the other way aboutand who is there among us who has not felt the pangs of injured innocence and known them to be grievous
i have two visitors staying with me though i have done nothing to provoke such an infliction and had been looking forward to a happy little christmas alone with the man of wrath and the babies
fate decreed otherwise
quite regularly if i look forward to anything fate steps in and decrees otherwise i dont know why it should but it does
i had not even invited these good ladieslike greatness on the modest they were thrust upon me
one is irais the sweet singer of the summer whom i love as she deserves but of whom i certainly thought i had seen the last for at least a year when she wrote and asked if i would have her over christmas as her husband was out of sorts and she didnt like him in that state
neither do i like sick husbands so full of sympathy i begged her to come and here she is
and the other is minora
why i have to have minora i dont know for i was not even aware of her existence a fortnight ago
then coming down cheerfully one morning to breakfastit was the very day after my return from englandi found a letter from an english friend who up till then had been perfectly innocuous asking me to befriend minora
i read the letter aloud for the benefit of the man of wrath who was eating spickgans a delicacy much sought after in these parts
do my dear elizabeth wrote my friend take some notice of the poor thing
she is studying art in dresden and has nowhere literally to go for christmas
she is very ambitious and hardworking  then interrupted the man of wrath she is not pretty
only ugly girls work hard  and she is really very clever  i do not like clever girls they are so stupid again interrupted the man of wrath
and unless some kind creature like yourself takes pity on her she will be very lonely  then let her be lonely  her mother is my oldest friend and would be greatly distressed to think that her daughter should be alone in a foreign town at such a season  i do not mind the distress of the mother  oh dear me i exclaimed impatiently i shall have to ask her to come  if you should be inclined the letter went on to play the good samaritan dear elizabeth i am positive you would find minora a bright intelligent companion  minora questioned the man of wrath
the april baby who has had a nursery governess of an altogether alarmingly zealous type attached to her person for the last six weeks looked up from her bread and milk
it sounds like islands she remarked pensively
the governess coughed
majora minora alderney and sark explained her pupil
i looked at her severely
if you are not careful april i said youll be a genius when you grow up and disgrace your parents  miss jones looked as though she did not like germans
i am afraid she despises us because she thinks we are foreignersan attitude of mind quite british and wholly to her credit but we on the other hand regard her as a foreigner which of course makes things complicated
shall i really have to have this strange girl i asked addressing nobody in particular and not expecting a reply
you need not have her said the man of wrath composedly but you will
you will write today and cordially invite her and when she has been here twentyfour hours you will quarrel with her
i know you my dear  quarrel
i
with a little artstudent miss jones cast down her eyes
she is perpetually scenting a scene and is always ready to bring whole batteries of discretion and tact and good taste to bear on us and seems to know we are disputing in an unseemly manner when we would never dream it ourselves but for the warning of her downcast eyes
i would take my courage in both hands and ask her to go for besides this superfluity of discreet behaviour she is although only nursery much too zealous and inclined to be always teaching and never playing but unfortunately the april baby adores her and is sure there never was any one so beautiful before
she comes every day with fresh accounts of the splendours of her wardrobe and feeling descriptions of her umbrellas and hats and miss jones looks offended and purses up her lips
in common with most governesses she has a little dark down on her upper lip and the april baby appeared one day at dinner with her own decorated in faithful imitation having achieved it after much struggling with the aid of a lead pencil and unbounded love
miss jones put her in the corner for impertinence
i wonder why governesses are so unpleasant
the man of wrath says it is because they are not married
without venturing to differ entirely from the opinion of experience i would add that the strain of continually having to set an example must surely be very great
it is much easier and often more pleasant to be a warning than an example and governesses are but women and women are sometimes foolish and when you want to be foolish it must be annoying to have to be wise
minora and irais arrived yesterday together or rather when the carriage drove up irais got out of it alone and informed me that there was a strange girl on a bicycle a little way behind
i sent back the carriage to pick her up for it was dusk and the roads are terrible
but why do you have strange girls here at all asked irais rather peevishly taking off her hat in the library before the fire and otherwise making herself very much at home i dont like them
im not sure that theyre not worse than husbands who are out of order
who is she
she would bicycle from the station and is i am sure the first woman who has done it
the little boys threw stones at her  oh my dear that only shows the ignorance of the little boys
never mind her
let us have tea in peace before she comes but we should be much happier without her she grumbled
werent we happy enough in the summer elizabethjust you and i  yes indeed we were i answered heartily putting my arms round her
the flame of my affection for irais burns very brightly on the day of her arrival besides this time i have prudently provided against her sinning with the saltcellars by ordering them to be handed round like vegetable dishes
we had finished tea and she had gone up to her room to dress before minora and her bicycle were got here
i hurried out to meet her feeling sorry for her plunged into a circle of strangers at such a very personal season as christmas
but she was not very shy indeed she was less shy than i was and lingered in the hall giving the servants directions to wipe the snow off the tyres of her machine before she lent an attentive ear to my welcoming remarks
i couldnt make your man understand me at the station she said at last when her mind was at rest about her bicycle i asked him how far it was and what the roads were like and he only smiled
is he german
but of course he ishow odd that he didnt understand
you speak english very wellvery well indeed do you know by this time we were in the library and she stood on the hearthrug warming her back while i poured her out some tea
what a quaint room she remarked looking round and the hall is so curious too
very old isnt it
theres a lot of copy here  the man of wrath who had been in the hall on her arrival and had come in with us began to look about on the carpet
copy he inquired wheres copy  ohmaterial you know for a book
im just jotting down what strikes me in your country and when i have time shall throw it into book form  she spoke very loud as english people always do to foreigners
my dear i said breathlessly to irais when i had got into her room and shut the door and minora was safely in hers what do you thinkshe writes books  whatthe bicycling girl  yesminoraimagine it  we stood and looked at each other with awestruck faces
how dreadful murmured irais
i never met a young girl who did that before  she says this place is full of copy full of what  thats what you make books with  oh my dear this is worse than i expected
a strange girl is always a bore among good friends but one can generally manage her
but a girl who writes bookswhy it isnt respectable
and you cant snub that sort of people theyre unsnubbable  oh but well try i cried with such heartiness that we both laughed
the hall and the library struck minora most indeed she lingered so long after dinner in the hall which is cold that the man of wrath put on his fur coat by way of a gentle hint
his hints are always gentle
she wanted to hear the whole story about the chapel and the nuns and gustavus adolphus and pulling out a fat notebook began to take down what i said
i at once relapsed into silence
well she said
thats all  oh but youve only just begun  it doesnt go any further
wont you come into the library  in the library she again took up her stand before the fire and warmed herself and we sat in a row and were cold
she has a wonderfully good profile which is irritating
the wind however is tempered to the shorn lamb by her eyes being set too closely together
irais lit a cigarette and leaning back in her chair contemplated her critically beneath her long eyelashes
you are writing a book she asked presently
wellyes i suppose i may say that i am
just my impressions you know of your country
anything that strikes me as curious or amusingi jot it down and when i have time shall work it up into something i daresay  are you not studying painting  yes but i cant study that for ever
we have an english proverb life is short and art is longtoo long i sometimes thinkand writing is a great relaxation when i am tired  what shall you call it  oh i thought of calling it journeyings in germany
it sounds well and would be correct
or jottings from german journeyingsi havent quite decided yet which  by the author of prowls in pomerania you might add suggested irais
and drivel from dresden said i
and bosh from berlin added irais
minora stared
i dont think those two last ones would do she said because it is not to be a facetious book
but your first one is rather a good title she added looking at irais and drawing out her notebook
i think ill just jot that down  if you jot down all we say and then publish it will it still be your book asked irais
but minora was so busy scribbling that she did not hear
and have you no suggestions to make sage asked irais turning to the man of wrath who was blowing out clouds of smoke in silence
oh do you call him sage cried minora and always in english  irais and i looked at each other
we knew what we did call him and were afraid minora would in time ferret it out and enter it in her notebook
the man of wrath looked none too well pleased to be alluded to under his very nose by our new guest as him  husbands are always sages said i gravely
though sages are not always husbands said irais with equal gravity
sages and husbandssage and husbands she went on musingly what does that remind you of miss minora  oh i knowhow stupid of me cried minora eagerly her pencil in midair and her brain clutching at the elusive recollection sage andwhyyesnoyes of courseoh disappointedly but thats vulgari cant put it in  what is vulgar i asked
she thinks sage and onions is vulgar said irais languidly but it isnt it is very good she got up and walked to the piano and sitting down began after a little wandering over the keys to sing
do you play i asked minora
yes but i am afraid i am rather out of practice  i said no more
i know what that sort of playing is
when we were lighting our bedroom candles minora began suddenly to speak in an unknown tongue
we stared
what is the matter with her  murmured irais
i thought perhaps said minora in english you might prefer to talk german and as it is all the same to me what i talk oh pray dont trouble said irais
we like airing our englishdont we elizabeth  i dont want my german to get rusty though said minora i shouldnt like to forget it  oh but isnt there an english song said irais twisting round her neck as she preceded us upstairs tis folly to remember tis wisdom to forget  you are not nervous sleeping alone i hope i said hastily
what room is she in asked irais
no
  ohdo you believe in ghosts  minora turned pale
what nonsense said i we have no ghosts here
goodnight
if you want anything mind you ring  and if you see anything curious in that room called irais from her bedroom door mind you jot it down   december thit is the fashion i believe to regard christmas as a bore of rather a gross description and as a time when you are invited to overeat yourself and pretend to be merry without just cause
as a matter of fact it is one of the prettiest and most poetic institutions possible if observed in the proper manner and after having been more or less unpleasant to everybody for a whole year it is a blessing to be forced on that one day to be amiable and it is certainly delightful to be able to give presents without being haunted by the conviction that you are spoiling the recipient and will suffer for it afterward
servants are only big children and are made just as happy as children by little presents and nice things to eat and for days beforehand every time the three babies go into the garden they expect to meet the christ child with his arms full of gifts
they firmly believe that it is thus their presents are brought and it is such a charming idea that christmas would be worth celebrating for its sake alone
as great secrecy is observed the preparations devolve entirely on me and it is not very easy work with so many people in our own house and on each of the farms and all the children big and little expecting their share of happiness
the library is uninhabitable for several days before and after as it is there that we have the trees and presents
all down one side are the trees and the other three sides are lined with tables a separate one for each person in the house
when the trees are lighted and stand in their radiance shining down on the happy faces i forget all the trouble it has been and the number of times i have had to run up and down stairs and the various aches in head and feet and enjoy myself as much as anybody
first the june baby is ushered in then the others and ourselves according to age then the servants then come the head inspector and his family the other inspectors from the different farms the mamsells the bookkeepers and secretaries and then all the children troops and troops of themthe big ones leading the little ones by the hand and carrying the babies in their arms and the mothers peeping round the door
as many as can get in stand in front of the trees and sing two or three carols then they are given their presents and go off triumphantly making room for the next batch
my three babies sang lustily too whether they happened to know what was being sung or not
they had on white dresses in honour of the occasion and the june baby was even arrayed in a lownecked and shortsleeved garment after the manner of teutonic infants whatever the state of the thermometer
her arms are like miniature prizefighters armsi never saw such things they are the pride and joy of her little nurse who had tied them up with blue ribbons and kept on kissing them
i shall certainly not be able to take her to balls when she grows up if she goes on having arms like that
when they came to say goodnight they were all very pale and subdued
the april baby had an exhaustedlooking japanese doll with her which she said she was taking to bed not because she liked him but because she was so sorry for him he seemed so very tired
they kissed me absently and went away only the april baby glancing at the trees as she passed and making them a curtesy
goodbye trees i heard her say and then she made the japanese doll bow to them which he did in a very languid and blase fashion
youll never see such trees again she told him giving him a vindictive shake for youll be brokened long before next time  she went out but came back as though she had forgotten something
thank the christkind so much mummy wont you for all the lovely things he brought us
i suppose youre writing to him now isnt you  i cannot see that there was anything gross about our christmas and we were perfectly merry without any need to pretend and for at least two days it brought us a little nearer together and made us kind
happiness is so wholesome it invigorates and warms me into piety far more effectually than any amount of trials and griefs and an unexpected pleasure is the surest means of bringing me to my knees
in spite of the protestations of some peculiarly constructed persons that they are the better for trials i dont believe it
such things must sour us just as happiness must sweeten us and make us kinder and more gentle
and will anybody affirm that it behoves us to be more thankful for trials than for blessings
we were meant to be happy and to accept all the happiness offered with thankfulnessindeed we are none of us ever thankful enough and yet we each get so much so very much more than we deserve
i know a womanshe stayed with me last summerwho rejoices grimly when those she loves suffer
she believes that it is our lot and that it braces us and does us good and she would shield no one from even unnecessary pain she weeps with the sufferer but is convinced it is all for the best
well let her continue in her dreary beliefs she has no garden to teach her the beauty and the happiness of holiness nor does she in the least desire to possess one her convictions have the sad gray colouring of the dingy streets and houses she lives amongstthe sad colour of humanity in masses
submission to what people call their lot is simply ignoble
if your lot makes you cry and be wretched get rid of it and take another strike out for yourself dont listen to the shrieks of your relations to their gibes or their entreaties dont let your own microscopic set prescribe your goingsout and comingsin dont be afraid of public opinion in the shape of the neighbour in the next house when all the world is before you new and shining and everything is possible if you will only be energetic and independent and seize opportunity by the scruff of the neck
to hear you talk said irais no one would ever imagine that you dream away your days in a garden with a book and that you never in your life seized anything by the scruff of its neck
and what is scruff
i hope i have not got any on me and she craned her neck before the glass
she and minora were going to help me decorate the trees but very soon irais wandered off to the piano and minora was tired and took up a book so i called in miss jones and the babiesit was miss joness last public appearance as i shall relateand after working for the best part of two days they were finished and looked like lovely ladies in widespreading sparkling petticoats holding up their skirts with glittering fingers
minora wrote a long description of them for a chapter of her book which is headed noeli saw that much because she left it open on the table while she went to talk to miss jones
they were fast friends from the very first and though it is said to be natural to take to ones own countrymen i am unable altogether to sympathise with such a reason for sudden affection
i wonder what they talk about i said to irais yesterday when there was no getting minora to come to tea so deeply was she engaged in conversation with miss jones
oh my dear how can i tell
lovers i suppose or else they think they are clever and then they talk rubbish  well of course minora thinks she is clever  i suppose she does
what does it matter what she thinks
why does your governess look so gloomy
when i see her at luncheon i always imagine she must have just heard that somebody is dead
but she cant hear that every day
what is the matter with her  i dont think she feels quite as proper as she looks i said doubtfully i was for ever trying to account for miss joness expression
but that must be rather nice said irais
it would be awful for her if she felt exactly the same as she looks  at that moment the door leading into the schoolroom opened softly and the april baby tired of playing came in and sat down at my feet leaving the door open and this is what we heard miss jones saying  parents are seldom wise and the strain the conscientious place upon themselves to appear so before their children and governess must be terrible
nor are clergymen more pious than other men yet they have continually to pose before their flock as such
as for governesses miss minora i know what i am saying when i affirm that there is nothing more intolerable than to have to be polite and even humble to persons whose weaknesses and follies are glaringly apparent in every word they utter and to be forced by the presence of children and employers to a dignity of manner in no way corresponding to ones feelings
the grave father of a family who was probably one of the least respectable of bachelors is an interesting study at his own table where he is constrained to assume airs of infallibility merely because his children are looking at him
the fact of his being a parent does not endow him with any supreme and sudden virtue and i can assure you that among the eyes fixed upon him not the least critical and amused are those of the humble person who fills the post of governess  oh miss jones how lovely we heard minora say in accents of rapture while we sat transfixed with horror at these sentiments
do you mind if i put that down in my book
you say it all so beautifully  without a few hours of relaxation continued miss jones of private indemnification for the toilsome virtues displayed in public who could wade through days of correct behaviour
there would be no reaction no room for better impulses no place for repentance
parents priests and governesses would be in the situation of a stout lady who never has a quiet moment in which she can take off her corsets  my dear what a firebrand whispered irais
i got up and went in
they were sitting on the sofa minora with clasped hands gazing admiringly into miss joness face which wore a very different expression from the one of sour and unwilling propriety i have been used to seeing
may i ask you to come to tea i said to minora
and i should like to have the children a little while  she got up very reluctantly but i waited with the door open until she had gone in and the two babies had followed
they had been playing at stuffing each others ears with pieces of newspaper while miss jones provided minora with noble thoughts for her work and had to be tortured afterward with tweezers
i said nothing to minora but kept her with us till dinnertime and this morning we went for a long sleighdrive
when we came in to lunch there was no miss jones
is miss jones ill asked minora
she is gone i said
gone  did you never hear of such things as sick mothers asked irais blandly and we talked resolutely of something else
all the afternoon minora has moped
she had found a kindred spirit and it has been ruthlessly torn from her arms as kindred spirits so often are
it is enough to make her mope and it is not her fault poor thing that she should have preferred the society of a miss jones to that of irais and myself
at dinner irais surveyed her with her head on one side
you look so pale she said are you not well  minora raised her eyes heavily with the patient air of one who likes to be thought a sufferer
i have a slight headache she replied gently
i hope you are not going to be ill said irais with great concern because there is only a cowdoctor to be had here and though he means well i believe he is rather rough minora was plainly startled
but what do you do if you are ill she asked
oh we are never ill said i the very knowledge that there would be no one to cure us seems to keep us healthy  and if any one takes to her bed said irais elizabeth always calls in the cowdoctor  minora was silent
she feels i am sure that she has got into a part of the world peopled solely by barbarians and that the only civilised creature besides herself has departed and left her at our mercy
whatever her reflections may be her symptoms are visibly abating
january stthe service on new years eve is the only one in the whole year that in the least impresses me in our little church and then the very bareness and ugliness of the place and the ceremonial produce an effect that a snug service in a welllit church never would
last night we took irais and minora and drove the three lonely miles in a sleigh
it was pitchdark and blowing great guns
we sat wrapped up to our eyes in furs and as mute as a funeral procession
we are going to the burial of our last years sins said irais as we started and there certainly was a funereal sort of feeling in the air
up in our gallery pew we tried to decipher our chorales by the light of the spluttering tallow candles stuck in holes in the woodwork the flames wildly blown about by the draughts
the wind banged against the windows in great gusts screaming louder than the organ and threatening to blow out the agitated lights together
the parson in his gloomy pulpit surrounded by a framework of dusty carved angels took on an awful appearance of menacing authority as he raised his voice to make himself heard above the clatter
sitting there in the dark i felt very small and solitary and defenceless alone in a great big black world
the church was as cold as a tomb some of the candles guttered and went out the parson in his black robe spoke of death and judgment i thought i heard a childs voice screaming and could hardly believe it was only the wind and felt uneasy and full of forebodings all my faith and philosophy deserted me and i had a horrid feeling that i should probably be well punished though for what i had no precise idea
if it had not been so dark and if the wind had not howled so despairingly i should have paid little attention to the threats issuing from the pulpit but as it was i fell to making good resolutions
this is always a bad signonly those who break them make them and if you simply do as a matter of course that which is right as it comes any preparatory resolving to do so becomes completely superfluous
i have for some years past left off making them on new years eve and only the gale happening as it did reduced me to doing so last night for i have long since discovered that though the year and the resolutions may be new i myself am not and it is worse than useless putting new wine into old bottles
but i am not an old bottle said irais indignantly when i held forth to her to the above effect a few hours later in the library restored to all my philosophy by the warmth and light and i find my resolutions carry me very nicely into the spring
i revise them at the end of each month and strike out the unnecessary ones
by the end of april they have been so severely revised that there are none left  there you see i am right if you were not an old bottle your new contents would gradually arrange themselves amiably as a part of you and the practice of your resolutions would lose its bitterness by becoming a habit  she shook her head
such things never lose their bitterness she said and that is why i dont let them cling to me right into the summer
when may comes i give myself up to jollity with all the rest of the world and am too busy being happy to bother about anything i may have resolved when the days were cold and dark  and that is just why i love you i thought
she often says what i feel
i wonder she went on after a pause whether men ever make resolutions  i dont think they do
only women indulge in such luxuries
it is a nice sort of feeling when you have nothing else to do giving way to endless grief and penitence and steeping yourself to the eyes in contrition but it is silly
why cry over things that are done
why do naughty things at all if you are going to repent afterward
nobody is naughty unless they like being naughty and nobody ever really repents unless they are afraid they are going to be found out  by nobody of course you mean women said irais
naturally the terms are synonymous
besides men generally have the courage of their opinions  i hope you are listening miss minora said irais in the amiably polite tone she assumes whenever she speaks to that young person
it was getting on towards midnight and we were sitting round the fire waiting for the new year and sipping glubwein prepared at a small table by the man of wrath
it was hot and sweet and rather nasty but it is proper to drink it on this one night so of course we did
minora does not like either irais or myself
we very soon discovered that and laugh about it when we are alone together
i can understand her disliking irais but she must be a perverse creature not to like me
irais has poked fun at her and i have been i hope very kind yet we are bracketed together in her black books
it is also apparent that she looks upon the man of wrath as an interesting example of an illused and misunderstood husband and she is disposed to take him under her wing and defend him on all occasions against us
he never speaks to her he is at all times a man of few words but as far as minora is concerned he might have no tongue at all and sits sphinxlike and impenetrable while she takes us to task about some remark of a profane nature that we may have addressed to him
one night some days after her arrival she developed a skittishness of manner which has since disappeared and tried to be playful with him but you might as well try to be playful with a graven image
the wife of one of the servants had just produced a boy the first after a series of five daughters and at dinner we drank the health of all parties concerned the man of wrath making the happy father drink a glass off at one gulp his heels well together in military fashion
minora thought the incident typical of german manners and not only made notes about it but joined heartily in the healthdrinking and afterward grew skittish
she proposed first of all to teach us a dance called i think the washington post and which was she said much danced in england and to induce us to learn she played the tune to us on the piano
we remained untouched by its beauties each buried in an easychair toasting our toes at the fire
amongst those toes were those of the man of wrath who sat peaceably reading a book and smoking
minora volunteered to show us the steps and as we still did not move danced solitary behind our chairs
irais did not even turn her head to look and i was the only one amiable or polite enough to do so
do i deserve to be placed in minoras list of disagreeable people side by side with irais
certainly not
yet i most surely am
it wants the music of course observed minora breathlessly darting in and out between the chairs apparently addressing me but glancing at the man of wrath
no answer from anybody
it is such a pretty dance she panted again after a few more gyrations
no answer
and is all the rage at home  no answer
do let me teach you
wont you try herr sage  she went up to him and dropped him a little curtesy
it is thus she always addresses him entirely oblivious to the fact so patent to every one else that he resents it
oh come put away that tiresome old book she went on gaily as he did not move i am certain it is only some dry agricultural work that you just nod over
dancing is much better for you irais and i looked at one another quite frightened
i am sure we both turned pale when the unhappy girl actually laid hold forcibly of his book and with a playful little shriek ran away with it into the next room hugging it to her bosom and looking back roguishly over her shoulder at him as she ran
there was an awful pause
we hardly dared raise our eyes
then the mall of wrath got up slowly knocked the ashes off the end of his cigar looked at his watch and went out at the opposite door into his own rooms where he stayed for the rest of the evening
she has never i must say been skittish since
i hope you are listening miss minora said irais because this sort of conversation is likely to do you good  i always listen when people talk sensibly replied minora stirring her grog
irais glanced at her with slightly doubtful eyebrows
do you agree with our hostesss description of women she asked after a pause
as nobodies
no of course i do not  yet she is right
in the eye of the law we are literally nobodies in our country
did you know that women are forbidden to go to political meetings here really out came the notebook
the law expressly forbids the attendance at such meetings of women children and idiots  children and idiotsi understand that said minora but womenand classed with children and idiots  classed with children and idiots repeated irais gravely nodding her head
did you know that the law forbids females of any age to ride on the top of omnibuses or tramcars  not really  do you know why  i cant imagine  because in going up and down the stairs those inside might perhaps catch a glimpse of the stocking covering their ankles  but what  did you know that the morals of the german public are in such a shaky condition that a glimpse of that sort would be fatal to them  but i dont see how a stocking  with stripes round it said irais
and darns in it i added could possibly be pernicious  the pernicious stocking or thoughts on the ethics of petticoats  said irais
put that down as the name of your next book on germany  i never know complained minora letting her notebook fall whether you are in earnest or not  dont you said irais sweetly
is it true appealed minora to the man of wrath busy with his lemons in the background that your law classes women with children and idiots  certainly he answered promptly and a very proper classification too  we all looked blank
thats rude said i at last
truth is always rude my dear he replied complacently
then he added if i were commissioned to draw up a new legal code and had previously enjoyed the privilege as i have been doing lately of listening to the conversation of you three young ladies i should make precisely the same classification  even minora was incensed at this
you are telling us in the most unvarnished manner that we are idiots  said irais
idiots
no no by no means
but childrennice little agreeable children
i very much like to hear you talk together
it is all so young and fresh what you think and what you believe and not of the least consequence to any one
not of the least consequence cried minora
what we believe is of very great consequence indeed to us  are you jeering at our beliefs inquired irais sternly
not for worlds
i would not on any account disturb or change your pretty little beliefs
it is your chief charm that you always believe everything
how desperate would our case be if young ladies only believed facts and never accepted another persons assurance but preferred the evidence of their own eyes
they would have no illusions and a woman without illusions is the dreariest and most difficult thing to manage possible  thing protested irais
the man of wrath usually so silent makes up for it from time to time by holding forth at unnecessary length
he took up his stand now with his back to the fire and a glass of glubwein in his hand
minora had hardly heard his voice before so quiet had he been since she came and sat with her pencil raised ready to fix for ever the wisdom that should flow from his lips
what would become of poetry if women became so sensible that they turned a deaf ear to the poetic platitudes of love
that love does indulge in platitudes i suppose you will admit he looked at irais
yes they all say exactly the same thing she acknowledged
who could murmur pretty speeches on the beauty of a common sacrifice if the listeners want of imagination was such as to enable her only to distinguish one victim in the picture and that one herself  minora took that down word for wordmuch good may it do her
who would be brave enough to affirm that if refused he will die if his assurances merely elicit a recommendation to diet himself and take plenty of outdoor exercise
women are responsible for such lies because they believe them
their amazing vanity makes them swallow flattery so gross that it is an insult and men will always be ready to tell the precise number of lies that a woman is ready to listen to
who indulges more recklessly in glowing exaggerations than the lover who hopes and has not yet obtained
he will like the nightingale sing with unceasing modulations display all his talent untiringly repeat his sweetest notes until he has what he wants when his song like the nightingales immediately ceases never again to be heard  take that down murmured irais aside to minoraunnecessary advice for her pencil was scribbling as fast as it could
a womans vanity is so immeasurable that after having had ninetynine objectlessons in the difference between promise and performance and the emptiness of pretty speeches the beginning of the hundredth will find her lending the same willing and enchanted ear to the eloquence of flattery as she did on the occasion of the first
what can the exhortations of the strongminded sister who has never had these experiences do for such a woman
it is useless to tell her she is mans victim that she is his plaything that she is cheated downtrodden kept under laughed at shabbily treated in every waythat is not a true statement of the case
she is simply the victim of her own vanity and against that against the belief in her own fascinations against the very part of herself that gives all the colour to her life who shall expect a woman to take up arms  are you so vain elizabeth inquired irais with a shocked face and had you lent a willing ear to the blandishments of ninetynine before you reached your final destiny  i am one of the sensible ones i suppose i replied for nobody ever wanted me to listen to blandishments  minora sighed
i like to hear you talk together about the position of women he went on and wonder when you will realise that they hold exactly the position they are fitted for
as soon as they are fit to occupy a better no power on earth will be able to keep them out of it
meanwhile let me warn you that as things now are only strongminded women wish to see you the equals of men and the strongminded are invariably plain
the pretty ones would rather see men their slaves than their equals  you know said irais frowning that i consider myself strongminded  and never rise till lunchtime  irais blushed
although i dont approve of such conduct it is very convenient in more ways than one i get through my housekeeping undisturbed and whenever she is disposed to lecture me i begin about this habit of hers
her conscience must be terribly stricken on the point for she is by no means as a rule given to meekness
a woman without vanity would be unattackable resumed the man of wrath
when a girl enters that downward path that leads to ruin she is led solely by her own vanity for in these days of policemen no young woman can be forced against her will from the path of virtue and the cries of the injured are never heard until the destroyer begins to express his penitence for having destroyed
if his passion could remain at whiteheat and he could continue to feed her ear with the protestations she loves no principles of piety or virtue would disturb the happiness of his companion for a mournful experience teaches that piety begins only where passion ends and that principles are strongest where temptations are most rare  but what has all this to do with us i inquired severely
you were displeased at our law classing you as it does and i merely wish to justify it he answered
creatures who habitually say yes to everything a man proposes when no one can oblige them to say it and when it is so often fatal are plainly not responsible beings  i shall never say it to you again my dear man i said
and not only that fatal weakness he continued but what is there candidly to distinguish you from children
you are older but not wiserreally not so wise for with years you lose the common sense you had as children
have you ever heard a group of women talking reasonably together  yeswe do irais and i cried in a breath
it has interested me went on the man of wrath in my idle moments to listen to their talk
it amused me to hear the malicious little stories they told of their best friends who were absent to note the spiteful little digs they gave their best friends who were present to watch the utter incredulity with which they listened to the tale of some other womans conquests the radiant good faith they displayed in connection with their own the instant collapse into boredom if some topic of socalled general interest by some extraordinary chance were introduced you must have belonged to a particularly nice set  remarked irais
and as for politics he said i have never heard them mentioned among women  children and idiots are not interested in such things i said
and we are much too frightened of being put in prison said irais
in prison echoed minora
dont you know said irais turning to her that if you talk about such things here you run a great risk of being imprisoned  but why  but why
because though you yourself may have meant nothing but what was innocent your words may have suggested something less innocent to the evil minds of your hearers and then the law steps in and calls it dolus eventualis and everybody says how dreadful and off you go to prison and are punished as you deserve to be  minora looked mystified
that is not however your real reason for not discussing them said the man of wrath they simply do not interest you
or it may be that you do not consider your female friends opinions worth listening to for you certainly display an astonishing thirst for information when male politicians are present
i have seen a pretty young woman hardly in her twenties sitting a whole evening drinking in the doubtful wisdom of an elderly political star with every appearance of eager interest
he was a bimetallic star and was giving her whole pamphletsful of information  she wanted to make up to him for some reason said irais and got him to explain his hobby to her and he was silly enough to be taken in
now which was the sillier in that case  she threw herself back in her chair and looked up defiantly beating her foot impatiently on the carpet
she wanted to be thought clever said the man of wrath
what puzzled me he went on musingly was that she went away apparently as serene and happy as when she came
the explanation of the principles of bimetallism produce as a rule a contrary effect  why she hadnt been listening cried irais and your simple star had been making a fine goose of himself the whole evening
prattle prattle simple star              bimetallic wunderbar
though youre given to describe             woman as a dummes weib
you yourself are sillier far             prattling bimetallic star  no doubt she had understood very little said the man of wrath taking no notice of this effusion
and no doubt the gentleman hadnt understood much either irais was plainly irritated
your opinion of woman said minora in a very small voice is not a high one
but in the sick chamber i suppose you agree that no one could take her place  if you are thinking of hospitalnurses i said i must tell you that i believe he married chiefly that he might have a wife instead of a strange woman to nurse him when he is sick  but said minora bewildered at the way her illusions were being knocked about the sickroom is surely the very place of all others in which a womans gentleness and tact are most valuable  gentleness and tact repeated the man of wrath
i have never met those qualities in the professional nurse
according to my experience she is a disagreeable person who finds in private nursing exquisite opportunities for asserting her superiority over ordinary and prostrate mankind
i know of no more humiliating position for a man than to be in bed having his feverish brow soothed by a sprucelydressed strange woman bristling with starch and spotlessness
he would give half his income for his clothes and probably the other half if she would leave him alone and go away altogether
he feels her superiority through every pore he never before realised how absolutely inferior he is he is abjectly polite and contemptibly conciliatory if a friend comes to see him he eagerly praises her in case she should be listening behind the screen he cannot call his soul his own and what is far more intolerable neither is he sure that his body really belongs to him he has read of ministering angels and the light touch of a womans hand but the day on which he can ring for his servant and put on his socks in private fills him with the same sort of wildness of joy that he felt as a homesick schoolboy at the end of his first term  minora was silent
iraiss foot was livelier than ever
the man of wrath stood smiling blandly down upon us
you cant argue with a person so utterly convinced of his infallibility that he wont even get angry with you so we sat round and said nothing
if he went on addressing irais who looked rebellious you doubt the truth of my remarks and still cling to the old poetic notion of noble selfsacrificing women tenderly helping the patient over the rough places on the road to death or recovery let me beg you to try for yourself next time any one in your house is ill whether the actual fact in any way corresponds to the picturesque belief
the angel who is to alleviate our sufferings comes in such a questionable shape that to the unimaginative she appears merely as an extremely selfconfident young woman wisely concerned first of all in securing her personal comfort much given to complaints about her food and to helplessness where she should be helpful possessing an extraordinary capacity for fancying herself slighted or not regarded as the superior being she knows herself to be morbidly anxious lest the servants should by some mistake treat her with offensive cordiality pettish if the patient gives more trouble than she had expected intensely injured and disagreeable if he is made so courageous by his wretchedness as to wake her during the nightan act of desperation of which i was guilty once and once only
oh these good women
what sane man wants to have to do with angels
and especially do we object to having them about us when we are sick and sorry when we feel in every fibre what poor things we are and when all our fortitude is needed to enable us to bear our temporary inferiority patiently without being forced besides to assume an attitude of eager and grovelling politeness towards the angel in the house  there was a pause
i didnt know you could talk so much sage said irais at length
what would you have women do then asked minora meekly
irais began to beat her foot up and down againwhat did it matter what men of wrath would have us do
there are not continued minora blushing husbands enough for every one and the rest must do something  certainly replied the oracle
study the art of pleasing by dress and manner as long as you are of an age to interest us and above all let all women pretty and plain married and single study the art of cookery
if you are an artist in the kitchen you will always be esteemed  i sat very still
every german woman even the wayward irais has learned to cook i seem to have been the only one who was naughty and wouldnt
only be careful he went on in studying both arts never to forget the great truth that dinner precedes blandishments and not blandishments dinner
a man must be made comfortable before he will make love to you and though it is true that if you offered him a choice between spickgans and kisses he would say he would take both yet he would invariably begin with the spickgans and allow the kisses to wait  at this i got up and irais followed my example
your cynicism is disgusting i said icily
you two are always exceptions to anything i may say he said smiling amiably
he stooped and kissed iraiss hand
she is inordinately vain of her hands and says her husband married her for their sake which i can quite believe
i am glad they are on her and not on minora for if minora had had them i should have been annoyed
minoras are bony with chillylooking knuckles ignored nails and too much wrist
i feel very well disposed towards her when my eye falls on them
she put one forward now evidently thinking it would be kissed too
did you know said irais seeing the movement that it is the custom here to kiss womens hands  but only married womens i added not desiring her to feel out of it never young girls  she drew it in again
it is a pretty custom she said with a sigh and pensively inscribed it in her book
january ththe bills for my roses and bulbs and other last years horticultural indulgences were all on the table when i came down to breakfast this morning
they rather frightened me
gardening is expensive i find when it has to be paid for out of ones own private pinmoney
the man of wrath does not in the least want roses or flowering shrubs or plantations or new paths and therefore he asks why should he pay for them
so he does not and i do and i have to make up for it by not indulging all too riotously in new clothes which is no doubt very chastening
i certainly prefer buying new rosetrees to new dresses if i cannot comfortably have both and i see a time coming when the passion for my garden will have taken such a hold on me that i shall not only entirely cease buying more clothes but begin to sell those that i already have
the garden is so big that everything has to be bought wholesale and i fear i shall not be able to go on much longer with only one man and a stork because the more i plant the more there will be to water in the inevitable drought and the watering is a serious consideration when it means going backwards and forwards all day long to a pump near the house with a little watercart
people living in england in almost perpetual mildness and moisture dont really know what a drought is
if they have some weeks of cloudless weather it is generally preceded and followed by good rains but we have perhaps an hours shower every week and then comes a month or six weeks drought
the soil is very light and dries so quickly that after the heaviest thundershower i can walk over any of my paths in my thin shoes and to keep the garden even moderately damp it should pour with rain regularly every day for three hours
my only means of getting water is to go to the pump near the house or to the little stream that forms my eastern boundary and the little stream dries up too unless there has been rain and is at the best of times difficult to get at having steep banks covered with forgetmenots
i possess one moist peaty bit of ground and that is to be planted with silver birches in imitation of the hirschwald and is to be carpeted between the birches with flaming azaleas
all the rest of my soil is sandythe soil for pines and acacias but not the soil for roses yet see what love will dothere are more roses in my garden than any other flower
next spring the bare places are to be filled with trees that i have ordered pines behind the delicate acacias and startling mountainashes oaks copperbeeches maples larches junipertreeswas it not elijah who sat down to rest under a junipertree
i have often wondered how he managed to get under it
it is a compact little tree not more than two to three yards high here and all closely squeezed up together
perhaps they grew more aggressively where he was
by the time the babies have grown old and disagreeable it will be very pretty here and then possibly they wont like it and if they have inherited the man of wraths indifference to gardens they will let it run wild and leave it to return to the state in which i found it
or perhaps their three husbands will refuse to live in it or to come to such a lonely place at all and then of course its fate is sealed
my only comfort is that husbands dont flourish in the desert and that the three will have to wait a long time before enough are found to go round
mothers tell me that it is a dreadful business finding one husband how much more painful then to have to look for three at oncethe babies are so nearly the same age that they only just escaped being twins
but i wont look
i can imagine nothing more uncomfortable than a soninlaw and besides i dont think a husband is at all a good thing for a girl to have
i shall do my best in the years at my disposal to train them so to love the garden and outdoor life and even farming that if they have a spark of their mother in them they will want and ask for nothing better
my hope of success is however exceedingly small and there is probably a fearful period in store for me when i shall be taken every day during the winter to the distant towns to ballsa poor old mother shivering in broad daylight in her party gown and being made to start after an early lunch and not getting home till breakfasttime next morning
indeed they have already developed an alarming desire to go to partings as they call them the april baby announcing her intention of beginning to do so when she is twelve
are you twelve mummy she asked
the gardener is leaving on the first of april and i am trying to find another
it is grievous changing so oftenin two years i shall have had threebecause at each change a great part of my plants and plans necessarily suffers
seeds get lost seedlings are not pricked out in time places already sown are planted with something else and there is confusion out of doors and despair in my heart
but he was to have married the cook and the cook saw a ghost and immediately left and he is going after her as soon as he can and meanwhile is wasting visibly away
what she saw was doors that are locked opening with a great clatter all by themselves on the hingeside and then somebody invisible cursed at her
these phenomena now go by the name of the ghost she asked to be allowed to leave at once as she had never been in a place where there was a ghost before
i suggested that she should try and get used to it but she thought it would be wasting time and she looked so ill that i let her go and the garden has to suffer
i dont know why it should be given to cooks to see such interesting things and withheld from me but i have had two others since she left and they both have seen the ghost
minora grows very silent as bedtime approaches and relents towards irais and myself and after having shown us all day how little she approves us when the bedroom candles are brought she quite begins to cling
she has once or twice anxiously inquired whether irais is sure she does not object to sleeping alone
if you are at all nervous i will come and keep you company she said i dont mind at all i assure you  but irais is not to be taken in by such simple wiles and has told me she would rather sleep with fifty ghosts than with one minora
since miss jones was so unexpectedly called away to her parents bedside i have seen a good deal of the babies and it is so nice without a governess that i would put off engaging another for a year or two if it were not that i should in so doing come within the reach of the arm of the law which is what every german spends his life in trying to avoid
the april baby will be six next month and after her sixth birthday is passed we are liable at any moment to receive a visit from a school inspector who will inquire curiously into the state of her education and if it is not up to the required standard all sorts of fearful things might happen to the guilty parents probably beginning with fines and going on crescendo to dungeons if owing to gaps between governesses and difficulties in finding the right one we persisted in our evil courses
shades of the prisonhouse begin to close here upon the growing boy and prisons compass the teuton about on every side all through life to such an extent that he has to walk very delicately indeed if he would stay outside them and pay for their maintenance
cultured individuals do not as a rule neglect to teach their offspring to read and write and say their prayers and are apt to resent the intrusion of an examining inspector into their homes but it does not much matter after all and i daresay it is very good for us to be worried indeed a philosopher of my acquaintance declares that people who are not regularly and properly worried are never any good for anything
in the eye of the law we are all sinners and every man is held to be guilty until he has proved that he is innocent
minora has seen so much of the babies that after vainly trying to get out of their way for several days she thought it better to resign herself and make the best of it by regarding them as copy and using them to fill a chapter in her book
so she took to dogging their footsteps wherever they went attended their uprisings and their lyings down engaged them if she could in intelligent conversation went with them into the garden to study their ways when they were sleighing drawn by a big dog and generally made their lives a burden to them
this went on for three days and then she settled down to write the result with the man of wraths typewriter borrowed whenever her notes for any chapter have reached the state of ripeness necessary for the process she describes as throwing into form she writes everything with a typewriter even her private letters
dont forget to put in something about a mothers knee said irais you cant write effectively about children without that oh of course i shall mention that replied minora
and pink toes i added
there are always toes and they are never anything but pink  i have that somewhere said minora turning over her notes
but after all babies are not a german speciality said irais and i dont quite see why you should bring them into a book of german travels
elizabeths babies have each got the fashionable number of arms and legs and are exactly the same as english ones  oh but they cant be just the same you know said minora looking worried
it must make a difference living here in this place and eating such odd things and never having a doctor and never being ill children who have never had measles and those things cant be quite the same as other children it must all be in their systems and cant get out for some reason or other
and a child brought up on chicken and ricepudding must be different to a child that eats spickgans and liver sausages
and they are different i cant tell in what way but they certainly are and i think if i steadily describe them from the materials i have collected the last three days i may perhaps hit on the points of difference  why bother about points of difference asked irais
i should write some little thing bringing in the usual parts of the picture such as knees and toes and make it mildly pathetic  but it is by no means an easy thing for me to do said minora plaintively i have so little experience of children  then why write it at all asked that sensible person elizabeth
i have as little experience as you said irais because i have no children but if you dont yearn after startling originality nothing is easier than to write bits about them
i believe i could do a dozen in an hour  she sat down at the writingtable took up an old letter and scribbled for about five minutes
there she said throwing it to minora you may have itpink toes and all complete  minora put on her eyeglasses and read aloud  when my baby shuts her eyes and sings her hymns at bedtime my stale and battered soul is filled with awe
all sorts of vague memories crowd into my mindmemories of my own mother and myselfhow many years agoof the sweet helplessness of being gathered up half asleep in her arms and undressed and put in my cot without being wakened of the angels i believed in of little children coming straight from heaven and still being surrounded so long as they were good by the shadow of white wingsall the dear poetic nonsense learned just as my baby is learning it at her mothers knee
she has not an idea of the beauty of the charming things she is told and stares wideeyed with heavenly eyes while her mother talks of the heaven she has so lately come from and is relieved and comforted by the interrupting bread and milk
at two years old she does not understand angels and does understand bread and milk at five she has vague notions about them and prefers bread and milk at ten both bread and milk and angels have been left behind in the nursery and she has already found out that they are luxuries not necessary to her everyday life
in later years she may be disinclined to accept truths secondhand insist on thinking for herself be earnest in her desire to shake off exploded traditions be untiring in her efforts to live according to a high moral standard and to be strong and pure and good  like tea explained irais
yet will she never with all her virtues possess onethousandth part of the charm that clung about her when she sang with quiet eyelids her first reluctant hymns kneeling on her mothers knees
i love to come in at bedtime and sit in the window in the setting sunshine watching the mysteries of her going to bed
her mother tubs her for she is far too precious to be touched by any nurse and then she is rolled up in a big bath towel and only her little pink toes peep out and when she is powdered and combed and tied up in her nightdress and all her curls are on end and her ears glowing she is knelt down on her mothers lap a little bundle of fragrant flesh and her face reflects the quiet of her mothers face as she goes through her evening prayer for pity and for peace  how very curious said minora when she had finished
that is exactly what i was going to say  oh then i have saved you the trouble of putting it together you can copy that if you like but have you a stale soul miss minora i asked
well do you know i rather think that is a good touch she replied it will make people really think a man wrote the book
you know i am going to take a mans name  that is precisely what i imagined said irais
you will call yourself john jones or george potts or some such sternly commonplace name to emphasise your uncompromising attitude towards all feminine weaknesses and no one will be taken in  i really think elizabeth said irais to me later when the click of minoras typewriter was heard hesitating in the next room that you and i are writing her book for her
she takes down everything we say
why does she copy all that about the baby
i wonder why mothers knees are supposed to be touching
i never learned anything at them did you
but then in my case they were only stepmothers and nobody ever sings their praises  my mother was always at parties i said and the nurse made me say my prayers in french  and as for tubs and powder went on irais when i was a baby such things were not the fashion
there were never any bathrooms and no tubs our faces and hands were washed and there was a footbath in the room and in the summer we had a bath and were put to bed afterwards for fear we might catch cold
my stepmother didnt worry much she used to wear pink dresses all over lace and the older she got the prettier the dresses got
when is she going  who
minora
i havent asked her that  then i will
it is really bad for her art to be neglected like this
she has been here an unconscionable timeit must be nearly three weeks  yes she came the same day you did i said pleasantly
irais was silent
i hope she was reflecting that it is not worse to neglect ones art than ones husband and her husband is lying all this time stretched on a bed of sickness while she is spending her days so agreeably with me
she has a way of forgetting that she has a home or any other business in the world than just to stay on chatting with me and reading and singing and laughing at any one there is to laugh at and kissing the babies and tilting with the man of wrath
naturally i love hershe is so pretty that anybody with eyes in his head must love herbut too much of anything is bad and next month the passages and offices are to be whitewashed and people who have ever whitewashed their houses inside know what nice places they are to live in while it is being done and there will be no dinner for irais and none of those succulent salads full of caraway seeds that she so devotedly loves
i shall begin to lead her thoughts gently back to her duties by inquiring every day anxiously after her husbands health
she is not very fond of him because he does not run and hold the door open for her every time she gets up to leave the room and though she has asked him to do so and told him how much she wishes he would he still wont
she stayed once in a house where there was an englishman and his nimbleness in regard to doors and chairs so impressed her that her husband has had no peace since and each time she has to go out of a room she is reminded of her disregarded wishes so that a shut door is to her symbolic of the failure of her married life and the very sight of one makes her wonder why she was born at least that is what she told me once in a burst of confidence
he is quite a nice harmless little man pleasant to talk to goodtempered and full of fun but he thinks he is too old to begin to learn new and uncomfortable ways and he has that horror of being made better by his wife that distinguishes so many righteous men and is shared by the man of wrath who persists in holding his glass in his left hand at meals because if he did not and i dont believe he particularly likes doing it his relations might say that marriage has improved him and thus drive the iron into his soul
this habit occasions an almost daily argument between one or other of the babies and myself
april hold your glass in your right hand  but papa doesnt  when you are as old as papa you can do as you like  which was embellished only yesterday by minora adding impressively and only think how strange it would look if everybody held their glasses so  april was greatly struck by the force of this proposition
january thit is very coldfifteen degrees of frost reaumur but perfectly delicious still bright weather and one feels jolly and energetic and amiably disposed towards everybody
the two young ladies are still here but the air is so buoyant that even they dont weigh on me any longer and besides they have both announced their approaching departure so that after all i shall get my whitewashing done in peace and the house will have on its clean pinafore in time to welcome the spring
minora has painted my portrait and is going to present it as a parting gift to the man of wrath and the fact that i let her do it and sat meekly times innumerable proves conclusively i hope that i am not vain
when irais first saw it she laughed till she cried and at once commissioned her to paint hers so that she may take it away with her and give it to her husband on his birthday which happens to be early in february
indeed if it were not for this birthday i really think she would have forgotten to go at all but birthdays are great and solemn festivals with us never allowed to slip by unnoticed and always celebrated in the presence of a sympathetic crowd of relations gathered from far and near to tell you how well you are wearing and that nobody would ever dream and that really it is wonderful who stand round a sort of sacrificial altar on which your years are offered up as a burntoffering to the gods in the shape of lighted pink and white candles stuck in a very large flat jammy cake
the cake with its candles is the chief feature and on the table round it lie the gifts each person present is more or less bound to give
as my birthday falls in the winter i get mittens as well as blottingbooks and photographframes and if it were in the summer i should get photographframes and blottingbooks and no mittens but whatever the present may be and by whomsoever given it has to be welcomed with the noisiest gratitude and loudest exclamations of joy and such words as entzuckend reizend herrlich wundervoll and suss repeated over and over again until the unfortunate geburtstagskind feels indeed that another year has gone and that she has grown older and wiser and more tired of folly and of vain repetitions
a flag is hoisted and all the morning the rites are celebrated the cake eaten healths drunk speeches made and hands nearly shaken off
the neighbouring parsons drive up and when nobody is looking their wives count the candles in the cake the active lady in the next schlass spares time to send a pot of flowers and to look up my age in the gotha almanach a deputation comes from the farms headed by the chief inspector in white kid gloves who invokes heavens blessings on the gracious ladys head and the babies are enchanted and sit in a corner trying on all the mittens
in the evening there is a dinner for the relations and the chief local authorities with more healthdrinking and speechifying and the next morning when i come downstairs thankful to have done with it i am confronted by the altar still in its place cake crumbs and candlegrease and all because any hasty removal of it would imply a most lamentable want of sentiment deplorable in anybody but scandalous and disgusting in a tender female
all birthdays are observed in this fashion and not a few wise persons go for a short trip just about the time theirs is due and i think i shall imitate them next year only trips to the country or seaside in december are not usually pleasant and if i go to a town there are sure to be relations in it and then the cake will spring up mushroomlike from the teeming soil of their affection
i hope it has been made evident in these pages how superior irais and myself are to the ordinary weaknesses of mankind if any further proof were needed it is furnished by the fact that we both in defiance of tradition scorn this celebration of birthday rites
years ago when first i knew her and long before we were either of us married i sent her a little brass candlestick on her birthday and when mine followed a few months later she sent me a notebook
no notes were written in it and on her next birthday i presented it to her she thanked me profusely in the customary manner and when my turn came i received the brass candlestick
since then we alternately enjoy the possession of each of these articles and the present question is comfortably settled once and for all at a minimum of trouble and expense
we never mention this little arrangement except at the proper time when we send a letter of fervid thanks
this radiant weather when mere living is a joy and sitting still over the fire out of the question has been going on for more than a week
sleighing and skating have been our chief occupation especially skating which is more than usually fascinating here because the place is intersected by small canals communicating with a lake and the river belonging to the lake and as everything is frozen black and hard we can skate for miles straight ahead without being obliged to turn round and come back againat all times an annoying and even mortifying proceeding
irais skates beautifully modesty is the only obstacle to my saying the same of myself but i may remark that all germans skate well for the simple reason that every year of their lives for three or four months they may do it as much as they like
minora was astonished and disconcerted by finding herself left behind and arriving at the place where tea meets us half an hour after we had finished
in some places the banks of the canals are so high that only our heads appear level with the fields and it is as minora noted in her book a curious sight to see three female heads skimming along apparently by themselves and enjoying it tremendously
when the banks are low we appear to be gliding deliciously over the roughest ploughed fields with or without legs according to circumstances
before we start i fix on the place where tea and a sleigh are to meet us and we drive home again because skating against the wind is as detestable as skating with it is delightful and an unkind nature arranges its blowing without the smallest regard for our convenience
yesterday by way of a change we went for a picnic to the shores of the baltic icebound at this season and utterly desolate at our nearest point
i have a weakness for picnics especially in winter when the mosquitoes cease from troubling and the anthills are at rest and of all my many favourite picnic spots this one on the baltic is the loveliest and best
as it is a threehours drive the man of wrath is loud in his lamentations when the special sort of weather comes which means as experience has taught him this particular excursion
there must be deep snow hard frost no wind and a cloudless sky and when on waking up i see these conditions fulfilled then it would need some very potent reason to keep me from having out a sleigh and going off
it is i admit a hard day for the horses but why have horses if they are not to take you where you want to go to and at the time you want to go
and why should not horses have hard days as well as everybody else
the man of wrath loathes picnics and has no eye for nature and frozen seas and is simply bored by a long drive through a forest that does not belong to him a single turnip on his own place is more admirable in his eyes than the tallest pinkest straightest pine that ever reared its snowcrowned head against the setting sunlight
now observe the superiority of woman who sees that both are good and after having gazed at the pine and been made happy by its beauty goes home and placidly eats the turnip
he went once and only once to this particular place and made us feel so small by his blast behaviour that i never invite him now
it is a beautiful spot endless forest stretching along the shore as far as the eye can reach and after driving through it for miles you come suddenly at the end of an avenue of arching trees upon the glistening oily sea with the orangecoloured sails of distant fishingsmacks shilling in the sunlight
whenever i have been there it has been windless weather and the silence so profound that i could hear my pulses beating
the humming of insects and the sudden scream of a jay are the only sounds in summer and in winter the stillness is the stillness of death
every paradise has its serpent however and this one is so infested by mosquitoes during the season when picnics seem most natural that those of my visitors who have been taken there for a treat have invariably lost their tempers and made the quiet shores ring with their wailing and lamentations
these despicable but irritating insects dont seem to have anything to do but to sit in multitudes on the sand waiting for any prey providence may send them and as soon as the carriage appears they rise up in a cloud and rush to meet us almost dragging us out bodily and never leave us until we drive away again
the sudden view of the sea from the messy pinecovered height directly above it where we picnic the wonderful stretch of lonely shore with the forest to the waters edge the coloured sails in the blue distance the freshness the brightness the vastnessall is lost upon the picnickers and made worse than indifferent to them by the perpetual necessity they are under of fighting these horrid creatures
it is nice being the only person who ever goes there or shows it to anybody but if more people went perhaps the mosquitoes would be less lean and hungry and pleased to see us
it has however the advantage of being a suitable place to which to take refractory visitors when they have stayed too long or left my books out in the garden all night or otherwise made their presence a burden too grievous to be borne then one fine hot morning when they are all looking limp i suddenly propose a picnic on the baltic
i have never known this proposal fail to be greeted with exclamations of surprise and delight
the baltic
you never told us you were within driving distance
how heavenly to get a breath of sea air on a day like this
the very thought puts new life into one
and how delightful to see the baltic
oh please take us and then i take them
but on a brilliant winters day my conscience is as clear as the frosty air itself and yesterday morning we started off in the gayest of spirits even minora being disposed to laugh immoderately on the least provocation
only our eyes were allowed to peep out from the fur and woollen wrappings necessary to our heads if we would come back with our ears and noses in the same places they were in when we started and for the first two miles the mirth created by each others strange appearance was uproariousa fact i mention merely to show what an effect dry bright intense cold produces on healthy bodies and how much better it is to go out in it and enjoy it than to stay indoors and sulk
as we passed through the neighbouring village with cracking of whip and jingling of bells heads popped up at the windows to stare and the only living thing in the silent sunny street was a melancholy fowl with ruffled feathers which looked at us reproachfully as we dashed with so much energy over the crackling snow
oh foolish bird irais called out as we passed youll be indeed a cold fowl if you stand there motionless and every one prefers them hot in weather like this  and then we all laughed exceedingly as though the most splendid joke had been made and before we had done we were out of the village and in the open country beyond and could see my house and garden far away behind glittering in the sunshine and in front of us lay the forest with its vistas of pines stretching away into infinity and a drive through it of fourteen miles before we reached the sea
it was a hoarfrost day and the forest was an enchanted forest leading into fairyland and though irais and i have been there often before and always thought it beautiful yet yesterday we stood under the final arch of frosted trees struck silent by the sheer loveliness of the place
for a long way out the sea was frozen and then there was a deep blue line and a cluster of motionless orange sails at our feet a narrow strip of pale yellow sand right and left the line of sparkling forest and we ourselves standing in a world of white and diamond traceries
the stillness of an eternal sunday lay on the place like a benediction
minora broke the silence by remarking that dresden was pretty but she thought this beat it almost
i dont quite see said irais in a hushed voice as though she were in a holy place how the two can be compared  yes dresden is more convenient of course replied minora after which we turned away and thought we would keep her quiet by feeding her so we went back to the sleigh and had the horses taken out and their cloths put on and they were walked up and down a distant glade while we sat in the sleigh and picnicked
it is a hard day for the horsesnearly thirty miles there and back and no stable in the middle but they are so fat and spoiled that it cannot do them much harm sometimes to taste the bitterness of life
i warmed soup in a little apparatus i have for such occasions which helped to take the chilliness off the sandwichesthis is the only unpleasant part of a winter picnic the clammy quality of the provisions just when you most long for something very hot
minora let her nose very carefully out of its wrappings took a mouthful and covered it up quickly again
she was nervous lest it should be frostnipped and truth compels me to add that her nose is not a bad nose and might even be pretty on anybody else but she does not know how to carry it and there is an art in the angle at which ones nose is held just as in everything else and really noses were intended for something besides mere blowing
it is the most difficult thing in the world to eat sandwiches with immense fur and woollen gloves on and i think we ate almost as much fur as anything and choked exceedingly during the process
minora was angry at this and at last pulled off her glove but quickly put it on again
how very unpleasant she remarked after swallowing a large piece of fur
it will wrap round your pipes and keep them warm said irais
pipes echoed minora greatly disgusted by such vulgarity
im afraid i cant help you i said as she continued to choke and splutter we are all in the same case and i dont know how to alter it there are such things as forks i suppose snapped minora
thats true said i crushed by the obviousness of the remedy but of what use are forks if they are fifteen miles off
so minora had to continue to eat her gloves
by the time we had finished the sun was already low behind the trees and the clouds beginning to flush a faint pink
the old coachman was given sandwiches and soup and while he led the horses up and down with one hand and held his lunch in the other we packed upor to be correct i packed and the others looked on and gave me valuable advice
this coachman peter by name is seventy years old and was born on the place and has driven its occupants for fifty years and i am nearly as fond of him as i am of the sundial indeed i dont know what i should do without him so entirely does he appear to understand and approve of my tastes and wishes
no drive is too long or difficult for the horses if i want to take it no place impossible to reach if i want to go to it no weather or roads too bad to prevent my going out if i wish to to all my suggestions he responds with the readiest cheerfulness and smoothes away all objections raised by the man of wrath who rewards his alacrity in doing my pleasure by speaking of him as an alter esel
in the summer on fine evenings i love to drive late and alone in the scented forests and when i have reached a dark part stop and sit quite still listening to the nightingales repeating their little tune over and over again after interludes of gurgling or if there are no nightingales listening to the marvellous silence and letting its blessedness descend into my very soul
the nightingales in the forests about here all sing the same tune and in the same key of e flat
i dont know whether all nightingales do this or if it is peculiar to this particular spot
when they have sung it once they clear their throats a little and hesitate and then do it again and it is the prettiest little song in the world
how could i indulge my passion for these drives with their pauses without peter
he is so used to them that he stops now at the right moment without having to be told and he is ready to drive me all night if i wish it with no sign of anything but cheerful willingness on his nice old face
the man of wrath deplores these eccentric tastes as he calls them of mine but has given up trying to prevent my indulging them because while he is deploring in one part of the house i have slipped out at a door in the other and am gone before he can catch me and have reached and am lost in the shadows of the forest by the time he has discovered that i am nowhere to be found
the brightness of peters perfections are sullied however by one spot and that is that as age creeps upon him he not only cannot hold the horses in if they dont want to be held in but he goes to sleep sometimes on his box if i have him out too soon after lunch and has upset me twice within the last yearonce last winter out of a sleigh and once this summer when the horses shied at a bicycle and bolted into the ditch on one side of the chaussee german for high road and the bicycle was so terrified at the horses shying that it shied too into the ditch on the other side and the carriage was smashed and the bicycle was smashed and we were all very unhappy except peter who never lost his pleasant smile and looked so placid that my tongue clave to the roof of my mouth when i tried to make it scold him
but i should think he ought to have been thoroughly scolded on an occasion like that said minora to whom i had been telling this story as we wandered on the yellow sands while the horses were being put in the sleigh and she glanced nervously up at peter whose mild head was visible between the bushes above us
shall we get home before dark  she asked
the sun had altogether disappeared behind the pines and only the very highest of the little clouds were still pink out at sea the mists were creeping up and the sails of the fishingsmacks had turned a dull brown a flight of wild geese passed across the disc of the moon with loud cacklings
before dark echoed irais i should think not
it is dark now nearly in the forest and we shall have the loveliest moonlight drive back  but it is surely very dangerous to let a man who goes to sleep drive you said minora apprehensively
but hes such an old dear i said
yes yes no doubt she replied tastily but there are wakeful old dears to be had and on a box they are preferable  irais laughed
you are growing quite amusing miss minora she said
he isnt on a box today said i and i never knew him to go to sleep standing up behind us on a sleigh but minora was not to be appeased and muttered something about seeing no fun in foolhardiness which shows how alarmed she was for it was rude
peter however behaved beautifully on the way home and irais and i at least were as happy as possible driving back with all the glories of the western sky flashing at us every now and then at the end of a long avenue as we swiftly passed and later on when they had faded myriads of stars in the narrow black strip of sky over our heads
it was bitterly cold and minora was silent and not in the least inclined to laugh with us as she had been six hours before
have you enjoyed yourself miss minora inquired irais as we got out of the forest on to the chaussee and the lights of the village before ours twinkled in the distance
how many degrees do you suppose there are now was minoras reply to this question
degreesof frost
oh dear me are you cold cried irais solicitously
well it isnt exactly warm is it said minora sulkily and irais pinched me
well but think how much colder you would have been without all that fur you ate for lunch inside you she said
and what a nice chapter you will be able to write about the baltic said i
why it is practically certain that you are the first english person who has ever been to just this part of it  isnt there some english poem said irais about being the first who ever burst  into that silent sea finished minora hastily
you cant quote that without its context you know  but i wasnt going to said irais meekly i only paused to breathe
i must breathe or perhaps i might die  the lights from my energetic friends schloss shone brightly down upon us as we passed round the base of the hill on which it stands she is very proud of this hill as well she may be seeing that it is the only one in the whole district
do you never go there asked minora jerking her head in the direction of the house
sometimes
she is a very busy woman and i should feel i was in the way if i went often  it would be interesting to see another north german interior said minora and i should be obliged if you would take me
but i cant fall upon her suddenly with a strange girl i protested and we are not at all on such intimate terms as to justify my taking all my visitors to see her  what do you want to see another interior for asked irais
i can tell you what it is like and if you went nobody would speak to you and if you were to ask questions and began to take notes the good lady would stare at you in the frankest amazement and think elizabeth had brought a young lunatic out for an airing
everybody is not as patient as elizabeth added irais anxious to pay off old scores
i would do a great deal for you miss minora i said but i cant do that  if we went said irais elizabeth and i would be placed with great ceremony on a sofa behind a large polished oval table with a crochetmat in the centreit has got a crochetmat in the centre hasnt it i nodded
and you would sit on one of the four little podgy buttony tasselly red chairs that are ranged on the other side of the table facing the sofa
they are red elizabeth again i nodded
the floor is painted yellow and there is no carpet except a rug in front of the sofa
the paper is dark chocolate colour almost black that is in order that after years of use the dirt may not show and the room need not be done up
dirt is like wickedness you see miss minoraits being there never matters it is only when it shows so much as to be apparent to everybody that we are ashamed of it
at intervals round the high walls are chairs and cabinets with lamps on them and in one corner is a great white cold stoveor is it majolica she asked turning to me
no it is white  there are a great many lovely big windows all ready to let in the air and the sun but they are as carefully covered with brown lace curtains under heavy stuff ones as though a whole row of houses were just opposite with peering eyes at every window trying to look in instead of there only being fields and trees and birds
no fire no sunlight no books no flowers but a consoling smell of red cabbage coming up under the door mixed in due season with soapsuds  when did you go there asked minora
ah when did i go there indeed
when did i not go there
i have been calling there all my life  minoras eyes rolled doubtfully first at me then at irais from the depths of her headwrappings they are large eyes with long dark eyelashes and far be it from me to deny that each eye taken by itself is fine but they are put in all wrong
the only thing you would learn there went on irais would be the significance of sofa corners in germany
if we three went there together i should be ushered into the righthand corner of the sofa because it is the place of honour and i am the greatest stranger elizabeth would be invited to seat herself in the lefthand corner as next in importance the hostess would sit near us in an armchair and you as a person of no importance whatever would either be left to sit where you could or would be put on a chair facing us and with the entire breadth of the table between us to mark the immense social gulf that separates the married woman from the mere virgin
these sofa corners make the drawing of nice distinctions possible in a way that nothing else could
the world might come to an end and create less sensation in doing it than you would miss minora if by any chance you got into the righthand corner of one
that you are put on a chair on the other side of the table places you at once in the scale of precedence and exactly defines your social position or rather your complete want of a social position and irais tilted her nose ever so little heavenwards
note it she added as the heading of your next chapter  note what asked minora impatiently
why the subtle significance of sofas of course replied irais
if she continued as minora made no reply appreciative of this suggestion you were to call unexpectedly the bad luck which pursues the innocent would most likely make you hit on a washingday and the distracted mistress of the house would keep you waiting in the cold room so long while she changed her dress that you would begin to fear you were to be left to perish from want and hunger and when she did appear would show by the bitterness of her welcoming smile the rage that was boiling in her heart  but what has the mistress of the house to do with washing  what has she to do with washing
oh you sweet innocentpardon my familiarity but such ignorance of countrylife customs is very touching in one who is writing a book about them  oh i have no doubt i am very ignorant said minora loftily
seasons of washing explained irais are seasons set apart by the hausfrau to be kept holy
they only occur every two or three months and while they are going on the whole house is in an uproar every other consideration sacrificed husband and children sunk into insignificance and no one approaching or interfering with the mistress of the house during these days of purification but at their peril  you dont really mean said minora that you only wash your clothes four times a year
yes i do mean it replied irais
well i think that is very disgusting said minora emphatically
irais raised those pretty delicate eyebrows of hers
then you must take care and not marry a german she said
but what is the object of it went on minora
why to clean the linen i suppose  yes yes but why only at such long intervals  it is an outward and visible sign of vast possessions in the shape of linen
if you were to want to have your clothes washed every week as you do in england you would be put down as a person who only has just enough to last that length of time and would be an object of general contempt  but i should be a clean object cried minora and my house would not be full of accumulated dirt  we said nothingthere was nothing to be said
it must be a happy land that england of yours irais remarked after a while with a sigha beatific vision no doubt presenting itself to her mind of a land full of washerwomen and agile gentlemen darting at doorhandles
it is a clean land at any rate replied minora
i dont want to go and live in it i saidfor we were driving up to the house and a memory of fogs and umbrellas came into my mind as i looked up fondly at its dear old west front and i felt that what i want is to live and die just here and that there never was such a happy woman as elizabeth
april thi have been so busy ever since irais and minora left that i can hardly believe the spring is here and the garden hurrying on its green and flowered petticoatonly its petticoat as yet for though the underwood is a fairyland of tender little leaves the trees above are still quite bare
february was gone before i well knew that it had come so deeply was i engaged in making hotbeds and having them sown with petunias verbenas and nicotina affinis while no less than thirty are dedicated solely to vegetables it having been borne in upon me lately that vegetables must be interesting things to grow besides possessing solid virtues not given to flowers and that i might as well take the orchard and kitchen garden under my wing
so i have rushed in with all the zeal of utter inexperience and my february evenings were spent poring over gardening books and my days in applying the freshly absorbed wisdom
who says that february is a dull sad slow month in the country
it was of the cheerfullest swiftest description here and its mild days enabled me to get on beautifully with the digging and manuring and filled my rooms with snowdrops
the longer i live the greater is my respect and affection for manure in all its forms and already though the year is so young a considerable portion of its pinmoney has been spent on artificial manure
the man of wrath says he never met a young woman who spent her money that way before i remarked that it must be nice to have an original wife and he retorted that the word original hardly described me and that the word eccentric was the one required
very well i suppose i am eccentric since even my husband says so but if my eccentricities are of such a practical nature as to result later in the biggest cauliflowers and tenderest lettuce in prussia why then he ought to be the first to rise up and call me blessed
i sent to england for vegetablemarrow seeds as they are not grown here and people try and make boiled cucumbers take their place but boiled cucumbers are nasty things and i dont see why marrows should not do here perfectly well
these and primroseroots are the english contributions to my garden
i brought over the roots in a tin box last time i came from england and am anxious to see whether they will consent to live here
certain it is that they dont exist in the fatherland so i can only conclude the winter kills them for surely if such lovely things would grow they never would have been overlooked
irais is deeply interested in the experiment she reads so many english books and has heard so much about primroses and they have got so mixed up in her mind with leagues and dames and disraelis that she longs to see this mysterious political flower and has made me promise to telegraph when it appears and she will come over
bur they are not going to do anything this year and i only hope those cold days did not send them off to the paradise of flowers
i am afraid their first impression of germany was a chilly one
irais writes about once a week and inquires after the garden and the babies and announces her intention of coming back as soon as the numerous relations staying with her have leftwhich they wont do  she wrote the other day until the first frosts nip them off when they will disappear like belated dahliasdouble ones of course for single dahlias are too charming to be compared to relations
i have every sort of cousin and uncle and aunt here and here they have been ever since my husbands birthdaynot the same ones exactly but i get so confused that i never know where one ends and the other begins
my husband goes off after breakfast to look at his crops he says and i am left at their mercy
i wish i had crops to go and look ati should be grateful even for one and would look at it from morning till night and quite stare it out of countenance sooner than stay at home and have the truth told me by enigmatic aunts
do you know my aunt bertha
she in particular spends her time propounding obscure questions for my solution
i get so tired and worried trying to guess the answers which are always truths supposed to be good for me to hear
why do you wear your hair on your forehead she asksand that sets me off wondering why i do wear it on my forehead and what she wants to know for or whether she does know and only wants to know if i will answer truthfully
i am sure i dont know aunt i say meekly after puzzling over it for ever so long perhaps my maid knows
shall i ring and ask her and then she informs me that i wear it so to hide an ugly line she says i have down the middle of my forehead and that betokens a listless and discontented disposition
well if she knew what did she ask me for
whenever i am with them they ask me riddles like that and i simply lead a dogs life
oh my dear relations are like drugsuseful sometimes and even pleasant if taken in small quantities and seldom but dreadfully pernicious on the whole and the truly wise avoid them  from minora i have only had one communication since her departure in which she thanked me for her pleasant visit and said she was sending me a bottle of english embrocation to rub on my bruises after skating that it was wonderful stuff and she was sure i would like it and that it cost two marks and would i send stamps
i pondered long over this
was it a parting hit intended as revenge for our having laughed at her
was she personally interested in the sale of embrocation
or was it merely minoras idea of a graceful return for my hospitality
as for bruises nobody who skates decently regards it as a bruiseproducing exercise and whenever there were any they were all on minora but she did happen to turn round once i remember just as i was in the act of tumbling down for the first and only time and her delight was but thinly veiled by her excessive solicitude and sympathy
i sent her the stamps received the bottle and resolved to let her drop out of my life i had been a good samaritan to her at the request of my friend but the best of samaritans resents the offer of healing oil for his own use
but why waste a thought on minora at easter the real beginning of the year in defiance of calendars
she belongs to the winter that is past to the darkness that is over and has no part or lot in the life i shall lead for the next six months
oh i could dance and sing for joy that the spring is here
what a resurrection of beauty there is in my garden and of brightest hope in my heart
the whole of this radiant easter day i have spent out of doors sitting at first among the windflowers and celandines and then later walking with the babies to the hirschwald to see what the spring had been doing there and the afternoon was so hot that we lay a long time on the turf blinking up through the leafless branches of the silver birches at the soft fat little white clouds floating motionless in the blue
we had tea on the grass in the sun and when it began to grow late and the babies were in bed and all the little windflowers folded up for the night i still wandered in the green paths my heart full of happiest gratitude
it makes one very humble to see oneself surrounded by such a wealth of beauty and perfection anonymously lavished and to think of the infinite meanness of our own grudging charities and how displeased we are if they are not promptly and properly appreciated
i do sincerely trust that the benediction that is always awaiting me in my garden may by degrees be more deserved and that i may grow in grace and patience and cheerfulness just like the happy flowers i so much love
