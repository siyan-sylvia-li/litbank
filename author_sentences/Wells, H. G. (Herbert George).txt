chapter i  the strange man's arrival   the stranger came early in february one wintry day through a biting wind and a driving snow the last snowfall of the year over the down walking from bramblehurst railway station and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand
he was wrapped up from head to foot and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose the snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest and added a white crest to the burden he carried
he staggered into the coach and horses more dead than alive and flung his portmanteau down
a fire he cried in the name of human charity
a room and a fire
he stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar and followed mrs hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain
and with that much introduction that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table he took up his quarters in the inn
mrs hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him a meal with her own hands
a guest to stop at iping in the wintertime was an unheardof piece of luck let alone a guest who was no haggler and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good fortune
as soon as the bacon was well under way and millie her lymphatic maid had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt she carried the cloth plates and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost eclat
although the fire was burning up briskly she was surprised to see that her visitor still wore his hat and coat standing with his back to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard
his gloved hands were clasped behind him and he seemed to be lost in thought
she noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his shoulders dripped upon her carpet
can i take your hat and coat sir
she said and give them a good dry in the kitchen
no he said without turning
she was not sure she had heard him and was about to repeat her question
he turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder
i prefer to keep them on he said with emphasis and she noticed that he wore big blue spectacles with sidelights and had a bush sidewhisker over his coatcollar that completely hid his cheeks and face
very well sir she said
as you like
in a bit the room will be warmer
he made no answer and had turned his face away from her again and mrs hall feeling that her conversational advances were illtimed laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out of the room
when she returned he was still standing there like a man of stone his back hunched his collar turned up his dripping hatbrim turned down hiding his face and ears completely
she put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis and called rather than said to him your lunch is served sir
thank you he said at the same time and did not stir until she was closing the door
then he swung round and approached the table with a certain eager quickness
as she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at regular intervals
chirk chirk chirk it went the sound of a spoon being rapidly whisked round a basin
that girl
she said
there
i clean forgot it
it's her being so long
and while she herself finished mixing the mustard she gave millie a few verbal stabs for her excessive slowness
she had cooked the ham and eggs laid the table and done everything while millie help indeed
had only succeeded in delaying the mustard
and him a new guest and wanting to stay
then she filled the mustard pot and putting it with a certain stateliness upon a gold and black teatray carried it into the parlour
she rapped and entered promptly
as she did so her visitor moved quickly so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing behind the table
it would seem he was picking something from the floor
she rapped down the mustard pot on the table and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in front of the fire and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel fender
she went to these things resolutely
i suppose i may have them to dry now she said in a voice that brooked no denial
leave the hat said her visitor in a muffled voice and turning she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her
for a moment she stood gaping at him too surprised to speak
he held a white clothit was a serviette he had brought with himover the lower part of his face so that his mouth and jaws were completely hidden and that was the reason of his muffled voice
but it was not that which startled mrs hall
it was the fact that all his forehead above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage and that another covered his ears leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting only his pink peaked nose
it was bright pink and shiny just as it had been at first
he wore a darkbrown velvet jacket with a high black linenlined collar turned up about his neck
the thick black hair escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages projected in curious tails and horns giving him the strangest appearance conceivable
this muffled and bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated that for a moment she was rigid
he did not remove the serviette but remained holding it as she saw now with a brown gloved hand and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses
leave the hat he said speaking very distinctly through the white cloth
her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received
she placed the hat on the chair again by the fire
i didn't know sir she began that and she stopped embarrassed
thank you he said drily glancing from her to the door and then at her again
i'll have them nicely dried sir at once she said and carried his clothes out of the room
she glanced at his whiteswathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door but his napkin was still in front of his face
she shivered a little as she closed the door behind her and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity
i never she whispered
there
she went quite softly to the kitchen and was too preoccupied to ask millie what she was messing about with now when she got there
the visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet
he glanced inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette and resumed his meal
he took a mouthful glanced suspiciously at the window took another mouthful then rose and taking the serviette in his hand walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes
this left the room in a twilight
this done he returned with an easier air to the table and his meal
the poor soul's had an accident or an op'ration or somethin' said mrs hall
what a turn them bandages did give me to be sure
she put on some more coal unfolded the clotheshorse and extended the traveller's coat upon this
and they goggles
why he looked more like a divin' helmet than a human man
she hung his muffler on a corner of the horse
and holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time
talkin' through it
 perhaps his mouth was hurt toomaybe
she turned round as one who suddenly remembers
bless my soul alive
she said going off at a tangent ain't you done them taters yet millie
when mrs hall went to clear away the stranger's lunch her idea that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she supposed him to have suffered was confirmed for he was smoking a pipe and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the mouthpiece to his lips
yet it was not forgetfulness for she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out
he sat in the corner with his back to the windowblind and spoke now having eaten and drunk and being comfortably warmed through with less aggressive brevity than before
the reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto
i have some luggage he said at bramblehurst station and he asked her how he could have it sent
he bowed his bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation
tomorrow
he said
there is no speedier delivery
and seemed quite disappointed when she answered no
was she quite sure
no man with a trap who would go over
mrs hall nothing loath answered his questions and developed a conversation
it's a steep road by the down sir she said in answer to the question about a trap and then snatching at an opening said it was there a carriage was upsettled a year ago and more
a gentleman killed besides his coachman
accidents sir happen in a moment don't they
but the visitor was not to be drawn so easily
they do he said through his muffler eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable glasses
but they take long enough to get well don't they

there was my sister's son tom jest cut his arm with a scythe tumbled on it in the 'ayfield and bless me
he was three months tied up sir
you'd hardly believe it
it's regular given me a dread of a scythe sir
i can quite understand that said the visitor
he was afraid one time that he'd have to have an op'rationhe was that bad sir
the visitor laughed abruptly a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite and kill in his mouth
was he
he said
he was sir
and no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him as i hadmy sister being took up with her little ones so much
there was bandages to do sir and bandages to undo
so that if i may make so bold as to say it sir  will you get me some matches
said the visitor quite abruptly
my pipe is out
mrs hall was pulled up suddenly
it was certainly rude of him after telling him all she had done
she gasped at him for a moment and remembered the two sovereigns
she went for the matches
thanks he said concisely as she put them down and turned his shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again
it was altogether too discouraging
evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations and bandages
she did not make so bold as to say however after all
but his snubbing way had irritated her and millie had a hot time of it that afternoon
the visitor remained in the parlour until four o'clock without giving the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion
for the most part he was quite still during that time it would seem he sat in the growing darkness smoking in the firelightperhaps dozing
once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals and for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room
he seemed to be talking to himself
then the armchair creaked as he sat down again
chapter ii  mr teddy henfrey's first impressions   at four o'clock when it was fairly dark and mrs hall was screwing up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea teddy henfrey the clockjobber came into the bar
my sakes
mrs hall said he but this is terrible weather for thin boots
the snow outside was falling faster
mrs hall agreed and then noticed he had his bag with him
now you're here mr teddy said she i'd be glad if you'd give th' old clock in the parlour a bit of a look
'tis going and it strikes well and hearty but the hourhand won't do nuthin' but point at six
and leading the way she went across to the parlour door and rapped and entered
her visitor she saw as she opened the door was seated in the armchair before the fire dozing it would seem with his bandaged head drooping on one side
the only light in the room was the red glow from the firewhich lit his eyes like adverse railway signals but left his downcast face in darknessand the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door
everything was ruddy shadowy and indistinct to her the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp and her eyes were dazzled
but for a second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide opena vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face
it was the sensation of a moment the whitebound head the monstrous goggle eyes and this huge yawn below it
then he stirred started up in his chair put up his hand
she opened the door wide so that the room was lighter and she saw him more clearly with the muffler held up to his face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before
the shadows she fancied had tricked her
would you mind sir this man acoming to look at the clock sir
she said recovering from the momentary shock
look at the clock
he said staring round in a drowsy manner and speaking over his hand and then getting more fully awake certainly
mrs hall went away to get a lamp and he rose and stretched himself
then came the light and mr teddy henfrey entering was confronted by this bandaged person
he was he says taken aback
good afternoon said the stranger regarding himas mr henfrey says with a vivid sense of the dark spectacleslike a lobster
i hope said mr henfrey that it's no intrusion
none whatever said the stranger
though i understand he said turning to mrs hall that this room is really to be mine for my own private use
i thought sir said mrs hall you'd prefer the clock  certainly said the stranger certainlybut as a rule i like to be alone and undisturbed
but i'm really glad to have the clock seen to he said seeing a certain hesitation in mr henfrey's manner
very glad
mr henfrey had intended to apologise and withdraw but this anticipation reassured him
the stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put his hands behind his back
and presently he said when the clockmending is over i think i should like to have some tea
but not till the clockmending is over
mrs hall was about to leave the roomshe made no conversational advances this time because she did not want to be snubbed in front of mr henfreywhen her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements about his boxes at bramblehurst
she told him she had mentioned the matter to the postman and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow
you are certain that is the earliest
he said
she was certain with a marked coldness
i should explain he added what i was really too cold and fatigued to do before that i am an experimental investigator
indeed sir said mrs hall much impressed
and my baggage contains apparatus and appliances
very useful things indeed they are sir said mrs hall
and i'm very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries
of course sir
my reason for coming to iping he proceeded with a certain deliberation of manner was  a desire for solitude
i do not wish to be disturbed in my work
in addition to my work an accident  i thought as much said mrs hall to herself  
necessitates a certain retirement
my eyesare sometimes so weak and painful that i have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together
lock myself up
sometimesnow and then
not at present certainly
at such times the slightest disturbance the entry of a stranger into the room is a source of excruciating annoyance to meit is well these things should be understood
certainly sir said mrs hall
and if i might make so bold as to ask  that i think is all said the stranger with that quietly irresistible air of finality he could assume at will
mrs hall reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion
after mrs hall had left the room he remained standing in front of the fire glaring so mr henfrey puts it at the clockmending
mr henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock and the face but extracted the works and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible
he worked with the lamp close to him and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands and upon the frame and wheels and left the rest of the room shadowy
when he looked up coloured patches swam in his eyes
being constitutionally of a curious nature he had removed the worksa quite unnecessary proceedingwith the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger
but the stranger stood there perfectly silent and still
so still it got on henfrey's nerves
he felt alone in the room and looked up and there grey and dim was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them
it was so uncanny to henfrey that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another
then henfrey looked down again
very uncomfortable position
one would like to say something
should he remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year
he looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot
the weather he began
why don't you finish and go
said the rigid figure evidently in a state of painfully suppressed rage
all you've got to do is to fix the hourhand on its axle
you're simply humbugging  certainly sirone minute more
i overlooked and mr henfrey finished and went
but he went feeling excessively annoyed
damn it
said mr henfrey to himself trudging down the village through the thawing snow a man must do a clock at times surely
and again can't a man look at youugly
and yet again seemingly not
if the police was wanting you you couldn't be more wropped and bandaged
at gleeson's corner he saw hall who had recently married the stranger's hostess at the coach and horses and who now drove the iping conveyance when occasional people required it to sidderbridge junction coming towards him on his return from that place
hall had evidently been stopping a bit at sidderbridge to judge by his driving
'ow do teddy
he said passing
you got a rum un up home
said teddy
hall very sociably pulled up
what's that
he asked
rumlooking customer stopping at the 'coach and horses' said teddy
my sakes
and he proceeded to give hall a vivid description of his grotesque guest
looks a bit like a disguise don't it
i'd like to see a man's face if i had him stopping in my place said henfrey
but women are that trustfulwhere strangers are concerned
he's took your rooms and he ain't even given a name hall
you don't say so
said hall who was a man of sluggish apprehension
yes said teddy
by the week
whatever he is you can't get rid of him under the week
and he's got a lot of luggage coming tomorrow so he says
let's hope it won't be stones in boxes hall
he told hall how his aunt at hastings had been swindled by a stranger with empty portmanteaux
altogether he left hall vaguely suspicious
get up old girl said hall
i s'pose i must see 'bout this
teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved
instead of seeing 'bout it however hall on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in sidderbridge and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the point
but the seed of suspicion teddy had sown germinated in the mind of mr hall in spite of these discouragements
you wim' don't know everything said mr hall resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity
and after the stranger had gone to bed which he did about halfpast nine mr hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife's furniture just to show that the stranger wasn't master there and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left
when retiring for the night he instructed mrs hall to look very closely at the stranger's luggage when it came next day
you mind your own business hall said mrs hall and i'll mind mine
she was all the more inclined to snap at hall because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind
in the middle of the night she woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips that came trailing after her at the end of interminable necks and with vast black eyes
but being a sensible woman she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again
chapter iii  the thousand and one bottles   so it was that on the twentyninth day of february at the beginning of the thaw this singular person fell out of infinity into iping village
next day his luggage arrived through the slushand very remarkable luggage it was
there were a couple of trunks indeed such as a rational man might need but in addition there were a box of booksbig fat books of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwritingand a dozen or more crates boxes and cases containing objects packed in straw as it seemed to hall tugging with a casual curiosity at the strawglass bottles
the stranger muffled in hat coat gloves and wrapper came out impatiently to meet fearenside's cart while hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping bring them in
out he came not noticing fearenside's dog who was sniffing in a dilettante spirit at hall's legs
come along with those boxes he said
i've been waiting long enough
and he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on the smaller crate
no sooner had fearenside's dog caught sight of him however than it began to bristle and growl savagely and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop and then sprang straight at his hand
whup
cried hall jumping back for he was no hero with dogs and fearenside howled lie down
and snatched his whip
they saw the dog's teeth had slipped the hand heard a kick saw the dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger's leg and heard the rip of his trousering
then the finer end of fearenside's whip reached his property and the dog yelping with dismay retreated under the wheels of the waggon
it was all the business of a swift halfminute
no one spoke everyone shouted
the stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg made as if he would stoop to the latter then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn
they heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom
you brute you
said fearenside climbing off the waggon with his whip in his hand while the dog watched him through the wheel
come here said fearensideyou'd better
hall had stood gaping
he wuz bit said hall
i'd better go and see to en and he trotted after the stranger
he met mrs hall in the passage
carrier's darg he said bit en
he went straight upstairs and the stranger's door being ajar he pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony being of a naturally sympathetic turn of mind
the blind was down and the room dim
he caught a glimpse of a most singular thing what seemed a handless arm waving towards him and a face of three huge indeterminate spots on white very like the face of a pale pansy
then he was struck violently in the chest hurled back and the door slammed in his face and locked
it was so rapid that it gave him no time to observe
a waving of indecipherable shapes a blow and a concussion
there he stood on the dark little landing wondering what it might be that he had seen
a couple of minutes after he rejoined the little group that had formed outside the coach and horses
there was fearenside telling about it all over again for the second time there was mrs hall saying his dog didn't have no business to bite her guests there was huxter the general dealer from over the road interrogative and sandy wadgers from the forge judicial besides women and children all of them saying fatuities wouldn't let en bite me i knows 'tasn't right have such dargs whad 'e bite 'n for then
and so forth
mr hall staring at them from the steps and listening found it incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen upstairs
besides his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his impressions
he don't want no help he says he said in answer to his wife's inquiry
we'd better be atakin' of his luggage in
he ought to have it cauterised at once said mr huxter especially if it's at all inflamed
i'd shoot en that's what i'd do said a lady in the group
suddenly the dog began growling again
come along cried an angry voice in the doorway and there stood the muffled stranger with his collar turned up and his hatbrim bent down
the sooner you get those things in the better i'll be pleased
it is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been changed
was you hurt sir
said fearenside
i'm rare sorry the darg  not a bit said the stranger
never broke the skin
hurry up with those things
he then swore to himself so mr hall asserts
directly the first crate was in accordance with his directions carried into the parlour the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness and began to unpack it scattering the straw with an utter disregard of mrs hall's carpet
and from it he began to produce bottleslittle fat bottles containing powders small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids fluted blue bottles labeled poison bottles with round bodies and slender necks large greenglass bottles large whiteglass bottles bottles with glass stoppers and frosted labels bottles with fine corks bottles with bungs bottles with wooden caps wine bottles saladoil bottlesputting them in rows on the chiffonnier on the mantel on the table under the window round the floor on the bookshelfeverywhere
the chemist's shop in bramblehurst could not boast half so many
quite a sight it was
crate after crate yielded bottles until all six were empty and the table high with straw the only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of testtubes and a carefully packed balance
and directly the crates were unpacked the stranger went to the window and set to work not troubling in the least about the litter of straw the fire which had gone out the box of books outside nor for the trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs
when mrs hall took his dinner in to him he was already so absorbed in his work pouring little drops out of the bottles into testtubes that he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and put the tray on the table with some little emphasis perhaps seeing the state that the floor was in
then he half turned his head and immediately turned it away again
but she saw he had removed his glasses they were beside him on the table and it seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow
he put on his spectacles again and then turned and faced her
she was about to complain of the straw on the floor when he anticipated her
i wish you wouldn't come in without knocking he said in the tone of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him
i knocked but seemingly  perhaps you did
but in my investigationsmy really very urgent and necessary investigationsthe slightest disturbance the jar of a doori must ask you  certainly sir
you can turn the lock if you're like that you know
any time
a very good idea said the stranger
this stror sir if i might make so bold as to remark  don't
if the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill
and he mumbled at herwords suspiciously like curses
he was so odd standing there so aggressive and explosive bottle in one hand and testtube in the other that mrs hall was quite alarmed
but she was a resolute woman
in which case i should like to know sir what you consider  a shillingput down a shilling
surely a shilling's enough
so be it said mrs hall taking up the tablecloth and beginning to spread it over the table
if you're satisfied of course  he turned and sat down with his coatcollar toward her
all the afternoon he worked with the door locked and as mrs hall testifies for the most part in silence
but once there was a concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table had been hit and the smash of a bottle flung violently down and then a rapid pacing athwart the room
fearing something was the matter she went to the door and listened not caring to knock
i can't go on he was raving
i can't go on
three hundred thousand four hundred thousand
the huge multitude
cheated
all my life it may take me
 patience
patience indeed
 fool
fool
there was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar and mrs hall had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy
when she returned the room was silent again save for the faint crepitation of his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle
it was all over the stranger had resumed work
when she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room under the concave mirror and a golden stain that had been carelessly wiped
she called attention to it
put it down in the bill snapped her visitor
for god's sake don't worry me
if there's damage done put it down in the bill and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him
i'll tell you something said fearenside mysteriously
it was late in the afternoon and they were in the little beershop of iping hanger
well
said teddy henfrey
this chap you're speaking of what my dog bit
wellhe's black
leastways his legs are
i seed through the tear of his trousers and the tear of his glove
you'd have expected a sort of pinky to show wouldn't you
wellthere wasn't none
just blackness
i tell you he's as black as my hat
my sakes
said henfrey
it's a rummy case altogether
why his nose is as pink as paint
that's true said fearenside
i knows that
and i tell 'ee what i'm thinking
that marn's a piebald teddy
black here and white therein patches
and he's ashamed of it
he's a kind of halfbreed and the colour's come off patchy instead of mixing
i've heard of such things before
and it's the common way with horses as any one can see
chapter iv  mr cuss interviews the stranger   i have told the circumstances of the stranger's arrival in iping with a certain fulness of detail in order that the curious impression he created may be understood by the reader
but excepting two odd incidents the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over very cursorily
there were a number of skirmishes with mrs hall on matters of domestic discipline but in every case until late april when the first signs of penury began he overrode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment
hall did not like him and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously and avoiding his visitor as much as possible
wait till the summer said mrs hall sagely when the artisks are beginning to come
then we'll see
he may be a bit overbearing but bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual whatever you'd like to say
the stranger did not go to church and indeed made no difference between sunday and the irreligious days even in costume
he worked as mrs hall thought very fitfully
some days he would come down early and be continuously busy
on others he would rise late pace his room fretting audibly for hours together smoke sleep in the armchair by the fire
communication with the world beyond the village he had none
his temper continued very uncertain for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation and once or twice things were snapped torn crushed or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence
he seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest intensity
his habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily upon him but though mrs hall listened conscientiously she could make neither head nor tail of what she heard
he rarely went abroad by daylight but at twilight he would go out muffled up invisibly whether the weather were cold or not and he chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and banks
his goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the penthouse of his hat came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the darkness upon one or two homegoing labourers and teddy henfrey tumbling out of the scarlet coat one night at halfpast nine was scared shamefully by the stranger's skulllike head he was walking hat in hand lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door
such children as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies and it seemed doubtful whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him or the reverse but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side
it was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as iping
opinion was greatly divided about his occupation
mrs hall was sensitive on the point
when questioned she explained very carefully that he was an experimental investigator going gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads pitfalls
when asked what an experimental investigator was she would say with a touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that and would thus explain that he discovered things
her visitor had had an accident she said which temporarily discoloured his face and hands and being of a sensitive disposition he was averse to any public notice of the fact
out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police
this idea sprang from the brain of mr teddy henfrey
no crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of february was known to have occurred
elaborated in the imagination of mr gould the probationary assistant in the national school this theory took the form that the stranger was an anarchist in disguise preparing explosives and he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted
these consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they met or in asking people who had never seen the stranger leading questions about him
but he detected nothing
another school of opinion followed mr fearenside and either accepted the piebald view or some modification of it as for instance silas durgan who was heard to assert that if he chooses to show enself at fairs he'd make his fortune in no time and being a bit of a theologian compared the stranger to the man with the one talent
yet another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic
that had the advantage of accounting for everything straight away
between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers
sussex folk have few superstitions and it was only after the events of early april that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the village
even then it was only credited among the women folk
but whatever they thought of him people in iping on the whole agreed in disliking him
his irritability though it might have been comprehensible to an urban brainworker was an amazing thing to these quiet sussex villagers
the frantic gesticulations they surprised now and then the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them round quiet corners the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances of curiosity the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors the pulling down of blinds the extinction of candles and lampswho could agree with such goings on
they drew aside as he passed down the village and when he had gone by young humourists would up with coatcollars and down with hatbrims and go pacing nervously after him in imitation of his occult bearing
there was a song popular at that time called the bogey man
miss statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert in aid of the church lamps and thereafter whenever one or two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared a bar or so of this tune more or less sharp or flat was whistled in the midst of them
also belated little children would call bogey man
after him and make off tremulously elated
cuss the general practitioner was devoured by curiosity
the bandages excited his professional interest the report of the thousand and one bottles aroused his jealous regard
all through april and may he coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger and at last towards whitsuntide he could stand it no longer but hit upon the subscriptionlist for a village nurse as an excuse
he was surprised to find that mr hall did not know his guest's name
he give a name said mrs hallan assertion which was quite unfoundedbut i didn't rightly hear it
she thought it seemed so silly not to know the man's name
cuss rapped at the parlour door and entered
there was a fairly audible imprecation from within
pardon my intrusion said cuss and then the door closed and cut mrs hall off from the rest of the conversation
she could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes then a cry of surprise a stirring of feet a chair flung aside a bark of laughter quick steps to the door and cuss appeared his face white his eyes staring over his shoulder
he left the door open behind him and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the steps and she heard his feet hurrying along the road
he carried his hat in his hand
she stood behind the door looking at the open door of the parlour
then she heard the stranger laughing quietly and then his footsteps came across the room
she could not see his face where she stood
the parlour door slammed and the place was silent again
cuss went straight up the village to bunting the vicar
am i mad
cuss began abruptly as he entered the shabby little study
do i look like an insane person
what's happened
said the vicar putting the ammonite on the loose sheets of his forthcoming sermon
that chap at the inn  well
give me something to drink said cuss and he sat down
when his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherrythe only drink the good vicar had availablehe told him of the interview he had just had
went in he gasped and began to demand a subscription for that nurse fund
he'd stuck his hands in his pockets as i came in and he sat down lumpily in his chair
sniffed
i told him i'd heard he took an interest in scientific things
he said yes
sniffed again
kept on sniffing all the time evidently recently caught an infernal cold
no wonder wrapped up like that
i developed the nurse idea and all the while kept my eyes open
bottleschemicalseverywhere
balance testtubes in stands and a smell ofevening primrose
would he subscribe
said he'd consider it
asked him pointblank was he researching
said he was
a long research
got quite cross
'a damnable long research' said he blowing the cork out so to speak
'oh' said i
and out came the grievance
the man was just on the boil and my question boiled him over
he had been given a prescription most valuable prescriptionwhat for he wouldn't say
was it medical
'damn you
what are you fishing after'
i apologised
dignified sniff and cough
he resumed
he'd read it
five ingredients
put it down turned his head
draught of air from window lifted the paper
swish rustle
he was working in a room with an open fireplace he said
saw a flicker and there was the prescription burning and lifting chimneyward
rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney
so
just at that point to illustrate his story out came his arm
well
no handjust an empty sleeve
lord
i thought that's a deformity
got a cork arm i suppose and has taken it off
then i thought there's something odd in that
what the devil keeps that sleeve up and open if there's nothing in it
there was nothing in it i tell you
nothing down it right down to the joint
i could see right down it to the elbow and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth
'good god'
i said
then he stopped
stared at me with those black goggles of his and then at his sleeve
well
that's all
he never said a word just glared and put his sleeve back in his pocket quickly
'i was saying' said he 'that there was the prescription burning wasn't i'
interrogative cough
'how the devil' said i 'can you move an empty sleeve like that'
'empty sleeve'
'yes' said i 'an empty sleeve'
'it's an empty sleeve is it
you saw it was an empty sleeve'
he stood up right away
i stood up too
he came towards me in three very slow steps and stood quite close
sniffed venomously
i didn't flinch though i'm hanged if that bandaged knob of his and those blinkers aren't enough to unnerve any one coming quietly up to you
'you said it was an empty sleeve'
he said
'certainly' i said
at staring and saying nothing a barefaced man unspectacled starts scratch
then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again
he did it very very slowly
i looked at it
seemed an age
'well'
said i clearing my throat 'there's nothing in it'
had to say something
i was beginning to feel frightened
i could see right down it
he extended it straight towards me slowly slowlyjust like thatuntil the cuff was six inches from my face
queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that
and then  well
somethingexactly like a finger and thumb it feltnipped my nose
bunting began to laugh
there wasn't anything there
said cuss his voice running up into a shriek at the there
it's all very well for you to laugh but i tell you i was so startled i hit his cuff hard and turned around and cut out of the roomi left him  cuss stopped
there was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic
he turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicar's very inferior sherry
when i hit his cuff said cuss i tell you it felt exactly like hitting an arm
and there wasn't an arm
there wasn't the ghost of an arm
mr bunting thought it over
he looked suspiciously at cuss
it's a most remarkable story he said
he looked very wise and grave indeed
it's really said mr bunting with judicial emphasis a most remarkable story
chapter v  the burglary at the vicarage   the facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through the medium of the vicar and his wife
it occurred in the small hours of whit monday the day devoted in iping to the club festivities
mrs bunting it seems woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed
she did not arouse her husband at first but sat up in bed listening
she then distinctly heard the pad pad pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining dressingroom and walking along the passage towards the staircase
as soon as she felt assured of this she aroused the rev
mr bunting as quietly as possible
he did not strike a light but putting on his spectacles her dressinggown and his bath slippers he went out on the landing to listen
he heard quite distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk downstairs and then a violent sneeze
at that he returned to his bedroom armed himself with the most obvious weapon the poker and descended the staircase as noiselessly as possible
mrs bunting came out on the landing
the hour was about four and the ultimate darkness of the night was past
there was a faint shimmer of light in the hall but the study doorway yawned impenetrably black
everything was still except the faint creaking of the stairs under mr bunting's tread and the slight movements in the study
then something snapped the drawer was opened and there was a rustle of papers
then came an imprecation and a match was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light
mr bunting was now in the hall and through the crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk
but the robber he could not see
he stood there in the hall undecided what to do and mrs bunting her face white and intent crept slowly downstairs after him
one thing kept mr bunting's courage the persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village
they heard the chink of money and realised that the robber had found the housekeeping reserve of goldtwo pounds ten in half sovereigns altogether
at that sound mr bunting was nerved to abrupt action
gripping the poker firmly he rushed into the room closely followed by mrs bunting
surrender
cried mr bunting fiercely and then stooped amazed
apparently the room was perfectly empty
yet their conviction that they had that very moment heard somebody moving in the room had amounted to a certainty
for half a minute perhaps they stood gaping then mrs bunting went across the room and looked behind the screen while mr bunting by a kindred impulse peered under the desk
then mrs bunting turned back the windowcurtains and mr bunting looked up the chimney and probed it with the poker
then mrs bunting scrutinised the wastepaper basket and mr bunting opened the lid of the coalscuttle
then they came to a stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other
i could have sworn said mr bunting
the candle
said mr bunting
who lit the candle
the drawer
said mrs bunting
and the money's gone
she went hastily to the doorway
of all the strange occurrences  there was a violent sneeze in the passage
they rushed out and as they did so the kitchen door slammed
bring the candle said mr bunting and led the way
they both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot back
as he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back door was just opening and the faint light of early dawn displayed the dark masses of the garden beyond
he is certain that nothing went out of the door
it opened stood open for a moment and then closed with a slam
as it did so the candle mrs bunting was carrying from the study flickered and flared
it was a minute or more before they entered the kitchen
the place was empty
they refastened the back door examined the kitchen pantry and scullery thoroughly and at last went down into the cellar
there was not a soul to be found in the house search as they would
daylight found the vicar and his wife a quaintlycostumed little couple still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the unnecessary light of a guttering candle
chapter vi  the furniture that went mad   now it happened that in the early hours of whit monday before millie was hunted out for the day mr hall and mrs hall both rose and went noiselessly down into the cellar
their business there was of a private nature and had something to do with the specific gravity of their beer
they had hardly entered the cellar when mrs hall found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their jointroom
as she was the expert and principal operator in this affair hall very properly went upstairs for it
on the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger's door was ajar
he went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed
but returning with the bottle he noticed that the bolts of the front door had been shot back that the door was in fact simply on the latch
and with a flash of inspiration he connected this with the stranger's room upstairs and the suggestions of mr teddy henfrey
he distinctly remembered holding the candle while mrs hall shot these bolts overnight
at the sight he stopped gaping then with the bottle still in his hand went upstairs again
he rapped at the stranger's door
there was no answer
he rapped again then pushed the door wide open and entered
it was as he expected
the bed the room also was empty
and what was stranger even to his heavy intelligence on the bedroom chair and along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments the only garments so far as he knew and the bandages of their guest
his big slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bedpost
as hall stood there he heard his wife's voice coming out of the depth of the cellar with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note by which the west sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience
george
you gart whad a wand
at that he turned and hurried down to her
janny he said over the rail of the cellar steps 'tas the truth what henfrey sez
'e's not in uz room 'e en't
and the front door's onbolted
at first mrs hall did not understand and as soon as she did she resolved to see the empty room for herself
hall still holding the bottle went first
if 'e en't there he said 'is close are
and what's 'e doin' 'ithout 'is close then
'tas a most curious business
as they came up the cellar steps they both it was afterwards ascertained fancied they heard the front door open and shut but seeing it closed and nothing there neither said a word to the other about it at the time
mrs hall passed her husband in the passage and ran on first upstairs
someone sneezed on the staircase
hall following six steps behind thought that he heard her sneeze
she going on first was under the impression that hall was sneezing
she flung open the door and stood regarding the room
of all the curious
she said
she heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed and turning was surprised to see hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair
but in another moment he was beside her
she bent forward and put her hand on the pillow and then under the clothes
cold she said
he's been up this hour or more
as she did so a most extraordinary thing happened
the bedclothes gathered themselves together leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail
it was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside
immediately after the stranger's hat hopped off the bedpost described a whirling flight in the air through the better part of a circle and then dashed straight at mrs hall's face
then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand and then the chair flinging the stranger's coat and trousers carelessly aside and laughing drily in a voice singularly like the stranger's turned itself up with its four legs at mrs hall seemed to take aim at her for a moment and charged at her
she screamed and turned and then the chair legs came gently but firmly against her back and impelled her and hall out of the room
the door slammed violently and was locked
the chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph for a moment and then abruptly everything was still
mrs hall was left almost in a fainting condition in mr hall's arms on the landing
it was with the greatest difficulty that mr hall and millie who had been roused by her scream of alarm succeeded in getting her downstairs and applying the restoratives customary in such cases
'tas sperits said mrs hall
i know 'tas sperits
i've read in papers of en
tables and chairs leaping and dancing  take a drop more janny said hall
'twill steady ye
lock him out said mrs hall
don't let him come in again
i half guessedi might ha' known
with them goggling eyes and bandaged head and never going to church of a sunday
and all they bottlesmore'n it's right for any one to have
he's put the sperits into the furniture my good old furniture
'twas in that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when i was a little girl
to think it should rise up against me now
just a drop more janny said hall
your nerves is all upset
they sent millie across the street through the golden five o'clock sunshine to rouse up mr sandy wadgers the blacksmith
mr hall's compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary
would mr wadgers come round
he was a knowing man was mr wadgers and very resourceful
he took quite a grave view of the case
arm darmed if thet ent witchcraft was the view of mr sandy wadgers
you warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he
he came round greatly concerned
they wanted him to lead the way upstairs to the room but he didn't seem to be in any hurry
he preferred to talk in the passage
over the way huxter's apprentice came out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window
he was called over to join the discussion
mr huxter naturally followed over in the course of a few minutes
the anglosaxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself there was a great deal of talk and no decisive action
let's have the facts first insisted mr sandy wadgers
let's be sure we'd be acting perfectly right in bustin' that there door open
a door onbust is always open to bustin' but ye can't onbust a door once you've busted en
and suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened of its own accord and as they looked up in amazement they saw descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger staring more blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass eyes of his
he came down stiffly and slowly staring all the time he walked across the passage staring then stopped
look there
he said and their eyes followed the direction of his gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door
then he entered the parlour and suddenly swiftly viciously slammed the door in their faces
not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away
they stared at one another
well if that don't lick everything
said mr wadgers and left the alternative unsaid
i'd go in and ask'n 'bout it said wadgers to mr hall
i'd d'mand an explanation
it took some time to bring the landlady's husband up to that pitch
at last he rapped opened the door and got as far as excuse me  go to the devil
said the stranger in a tremendous voice and shut that door after you
so that brief interview terminated
chapter vii  the unveiling of the stranger   the stranger went into the little parlour of the coach and horses about halfpast five in the morning and there he remained until near midday the blinds down the door shut and none after hall's repulse venturing near him
all that time he must have fasted
thrice he rang his bell the third time furiously and continuously but no one answered him
him and his 'go to the devil' indeed
said mrs hall
presently came an imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage and two and two were put together
hall assisted by wadgers went off to find mr shuckleforth the magistrate and take his advice
no one ventured upstairs
how the stranger occupied himself is unknown
now and then he would stride violently up and down and twice came an outburst of curses a tearing of paper and a violent smashing of bottles
the little group of scared but curious people increased
mrs huxter came over some gay young fellows resplendent in black readymade jackets and pique paper tiesfor it was whit mondayjoined the group with confused interrogations
young archie harker distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep under the windowblinds
he could see nothing but gave reason for supposing that he did and others of the iping youth presently joined him
it was the finest of all possible whit mondays and down the village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths a shooting gallery and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy
the gentlemen wore blue jerseys the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes
wodger of the purple fawn and mr jaggers the cobbler who also sold old secondhand ordinary bicycles were stretching a string of unionjacks and royal ensigns which had originally celebrated the first victorian jubilee across the road
and inside in the artificial darkness of the parlour into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated the stranger hungry we must suppose and fearful hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles and occasionally swore savagely at the boys audible if invisible outside the windows
in the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air
so much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room
about noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar
mrs hall he said
somebody went sheepishly and called for mrs hall
mrs hall appeared after an interval a little short of breath but all the fiercer for that
hall was still out
she had deliberated over this scene and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it
is it your bill you're wanting sir
she said
why wasn't my breakfast laid
why haven't you prepared my meals and answered my bell
do you think i live without eating
why isn't my bill paid
said mrs hall
that's what i want to know
i told you three days ago i was awaiting a remittance  i told you two days ago i wasn't going to await no remittances
you can't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit if my bill's been waiting these five days can you
the stranger swore briefly but vividly
nar nar
from the bar
and i'd thank you kindly sir if you'd keep your swearing to yourself sir said mrs hall
the stranger stood looking more like an angry divinghelmet than ever
it was universally felt in the bar that mrs hall had the better of him
his next words showed as much
look here my good woman he began
don't 'good woman' me said mrs hall
i've told you my remittance hasn't come
remittance indeed
said mrs hall
still i daresay in my pocket  you told me three days ago that you hadn't anything but a sovereign's worth of silver upon you
well i've found some more  'ullo
from the bar
i wonder where you found it said mrs hall
that seemed to annoy the stranger very much
he stamped his foot
what do you mean
he said
that i wonder where you found it said mrs hall
and before i take any bills or get any breakfasts or do any such things whatsoever you got to tell me one or two things i don't understand and what nobody don't understand and what everybody is very anxious to understand
i want to know what you been doing t'my chair upstairs and i want to know how 'tis your room was empty and how you got in again
them as stops in this house comes in by the doorsthat's the rule of the house and that you didn't do and what i want to know is how you did come in
and i want to know  suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched stamped his foot and said stop
with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her instantly
you don't understand he said who i am or what i am
i'll show you
by heaven
i'll show you
then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it
the centre of his face became a black cavity
here he said
he stepped forward and handed mrs hall something which she staring at his metamorphosed face accepted automatically
then when she saw what it was she screamed loudly dropped it and staggered back
the noseit was the stranger's nose
pink and shiningrolled on the floor
then he removed his spectacles and everyone in the bar gasped
he took off his hat and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages
for a moment they resisted him
a flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar
oh my gard
said some one
then off they came
it was worse than anything
mrs hall standing openmouthed and horrorstruck shrieked at what she saw and made for the door of the house
everyone began to move
they were prepared for scars disfigurements tangible horrors but nothing
the bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them
everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps
for the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coatcollar of him and thennothingness no visible thing at all
people down the village heard shouts and shrieks and looking up the street saw the coach and horses violently firing out its humanity
they saw mrs hall fall down and mr teddy henfrey jump to avoid tumbling over her and then they heard the frightful screams of millie who emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult had come upon the headless stranger from behind
these increased suddenly
forthwith everyone all down the street the sweetstuff seller cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant the swing man little boys and girls rustic dandies smart wenches smocked elders and aproned gipsiesbegan running towards the inn and in a miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people and rapidly increasing swayed and hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested in front of mrs hall's establishment
everyone seemed eager to talk at once and the result was babel
a small group supported mrs hall who was picked up in a state of collapse
there was a conference and the incredible evidence of a vociferous eyewitness
o bogey
what's he been doin' then
ain't hurt the girl 'as 'e
run at en with a knife i believe
no 'ed i tell ye
i don't mean no manner of speaking
i mean marn 'ithout a 'ed
narnsense
'tis some conjuring trick
fetched off 'is wrapping 'e did  in its struggles to see in through the open door the crowd formed itself into a straggling wedge with the more adventurous apex nearest the inn
he stood for a moment i heerd the gal scream and he turned
i saw her skirts whisk and he went after her
didn't take ten seconds
back he comes with a knife in uz hand and a loaf stood just as if he was staring
not a moment ago
went in that there door
i tell 'e 'e ain't gart no 'ed at all
you just missed en  there was a disturbance behind and the speaker stopped to step aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house first mr hall very red and determined then mr bobby jaffers the village constable and then the wary mr wadgers
they had come now armed with a warrant
people shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances
'ed or no 'ed said jaffers i got to 'rest en and 'rest en i will
mr hall marched up the steps marched straight to the door of the parlour and flung it open
constable he said do your duty
jaffers marched in
hall next wadgers last
they saw in the dim light the headless figure facing them with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other
that's him
said hall
what the devil's this
came in a tone of angry expostulation from above the collar of the figure
you're a damned rum customer mister said mr jaffers
but 'ed or no 'ed the warrant says 'body' and duty's duty  keep off
said the figure starting back
abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese and mr hall just grasped the knife on the table in time to save it
off came the stranger's left glove and was slapped in jaffers' face
in another moment jaffers cutting short some statement concerning a warrant had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat
he got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout but he kept his grip
hall sent the knife sliding along the table to wadgers who acted as goalkeeper for the offensive so to speak and then stepped forward as jaffers and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him clutching and hitting in
a chair stood in the way and went aside with a crash as they came down together
get the feet said jaffers between his teeth
mr hall endeavouring to act on instructions received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment and mr wadgers seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of jaffers retreated towards the door knife in hand and so collided with mr huxter and the sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order
at the same moment down came three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room
i'll surrender cried the stranger though he had jaffers down and in another moment he stood up panting a strange figure headless and handlessfor he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left
it's no good he said as if sobbing for breath
it was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space but the sussex peasants are perhaps the most matteroffact people under the sun
jaffers got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs
then he stared
i say
said jaffers brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business darn it
can't use 'em as i can see
the stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone
then he said something about his shin and stooped down
he seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks
why
said huxter suddenly that's not a man at all
it's just empty clothes
look
you can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes
i could put my arm  he extended his hand it seemed to meet something in midair and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation
i wish you'd keep your fingers out of my eye said the aerial voice in a tone of savage expostulation
the fact is i'm all herehead hands legs and all the rest of it but it happens i'm invisible
it's a confounded nuisance but i am
that's no reason why i should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in iping is it
the suit of clothes now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen supports stood up arms akimbo
several other of the men folks had now entered the room so that it was closely crowded
invisible eh
said huxter ignoring the stranger's abuse
who ever heard the likes of that
it's strange perhaps but it's not a crime
why am i assaulted by a policeman in this fashion
ah
that's a different matter said jaffers
no doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light but i got a warrant and it's all correct
what i'm after ain't no invisibilityit's burglary
there's a house been broke into and money took
well
and circumstances certainly point  stuff and nonsense
said the invisible man
i hope so sir but i've got my instructions
well said the stranger i'll come
i'll come
but no handcuffs
it's the regular thing said jaffers
no handcuffs stipulated the stranger
pardon me said jaffers
abruptly the figure sat down and before any one could realise was was being done the slippers socks and trousers had been kicked off under the table
then he sprang up again and flung off his coat
here stop that said jaffers suddenly realising what was happening
he gripped at the waistcoat it struggled and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limp and empty in his hand
hold him
said jaffers loudly
once he gets the things off  hold him
cried everyone and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger
the shirtsleeve planted a shrewd blow in hall's face that stopped his openarmed advance and sent him backward into old toothsome the sexton and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms even as a shirt that is being thrust over a man's head
jaffers clutched at it and only helped to pull it off he was struck in the mouth out of the air and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote teddy henfrey savagely upon the crown of his head
look out
said everybody fencing at random and hitting at nothing
hold him
shut the door
don't let him loose
i got something
here he is
a perfect babel of noises they made
everybody it seemed was being hit all at once and sandy wadgers knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose reopened the door and led the rout
the others following incontinently were jammed for a moment in the corner by the doorway
the hitting continued
phipps the unitarian had a front tooth broken and henfrey was injured in the cartilage of his ear
jaffers was struck under the jaw and turning caught at something that intervened between him and huxter in the melee and prevented their coming together
he felt a muscular chest and in another moment the whole mass of struggling excited men shot out into the crowded hall
i got him
shouted jaffers choking and reeling through them all and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy
men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed swiftly towards the house door and went spinning down the halfdozen steps of the inn
jaffers cried in a strangled voiceholding tight nevertheless and making play with his kneespun around and fell heavily undermost with his head on the gravel
only then did his fingers relax
there were excited cries of hold him
invisible
and so forth and a young fellow a stranger in the place whose name did not come to light rushed in at once caught something missed his hold and fell over the constable's prostrate body
halfway across the road a woman screamed as something pushed by her a dog kicked apparently yelped and ran howling into huxter's yard and with that the transit of the invisible man was accomplished
for a space people stood amazed and gesticulating and then came panic and scattered them abroad through the village as a gust scatters dead leaves
but jaffers lay quite still face upward and knees bent at the foot of the steps of the inn
chapter viii  in transit   the eighth chapter is exceedingly brief and relates that gibbons the amateur naturalist of the district while lying out on the spacious open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him as he thought and almost dozing heard close to him the sound as of a man coughing sneezing and then swearing savagely to himself and looking beheld nothing
yet the voice was indisputable
it continued to swear with that breadth and variety that distinguishes the swearing of a cultivated man
it grew to a climax diminished again and died away in the distance going as it seemed to him in the direction of adderdean
it lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended
gibbons had heard nothing of the morning's occurrences but the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished he got up hastily and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village as fast as he could go
chapter ix  mr thomas marvel   you must picture mr thomas marvel as a person of copious flexible visage a nose of cylindrical protrusion a liquorish ample fluctuating mouth and a beard of bristling eccentricity
his figure inclined to embonpoint his short limbs accentuated this inclination
he wore a furry silk hat and the frequent substitution of twine and shoelaces for buttons apparent at critical points of his costume marked a man essentially bachelor
mr thomas marvel was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside over the down towards adderdean about a mile and a half out of iping
his feet save for socks of irregular openwork were bare his big toes were broad and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog
in a leisurely mannerhe did everything in a leisurely mannerhe was contemplating trying on a pair of boots
they were the soundest boots he had come across for a long time but too large for him whereas the ones he had were in dry weather a very comfortable fit but too thinsoled for damp
mr thomas marvel hated roomy shoes but then he hated damp
he had never properly thought out which he hated most and it was a pleasant day and there was nothing better to do
so he put the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them
and seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony it suddenly occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see
he was not at all startled by a voice behind him
they're boots anyhow said the voice
they arecharity boots said mr thomas marvel with his head on one side regarding them distastefully and which is the ugliest pair in the whole blessed universe i'm darned if i know
h'm said the voice
i've worn worsein fact i've worn none
but none so owdacious uglyif you'll allow the expression
i've been cadging bootsin particularfor days
because i was sick of them
they're sound enough of course
but a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering lot of his boots
and if you'll believe me i've raised nothing in the whole blessed country try as i would but them
look at 'em
and a good country for boots too in a general way
but it's just my promiscuous luck
i've got my boots in this country ten years or more
and then they treat you like this
it's a beast of a country said the voice
and pigs for people
ain't it
said mr thomas marvel
lord
but them boots
it beats it
he turned his head over his shoulder to the right to look at the boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons and lo
where the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots
he was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement
where are yer
said mr thomas marvel over his shoulder and coming on all fours
he saw a stretch of empty downs with the wind swaying the remote greenpointed furze bushes
am i drunk
said mr marvel
have i had visions
was i talking to myself
what the  don't be alarmed said a voice
none of your ventriloquising me said mr thomas marvel rising sharply to his feet
where are yer
alarmed indeed
don't be alarmed repeated the voice
you'll be alarmed in a minute you silly fool said mr thomas marvel
where are yer
lemme get my mark on yer  are yer buried
said mr thomas marvel after an interval
there was no answer
mr thomas marvel stood bootless and amazed his jacket nearly thrown off
peewit said a peewit very remote
peewit indeed
said mr thomas marvel
this ain't no time for foolery
the down was desolate east and west north and south the road with its shallow ditches and white bordering stakes ran smooth and empty north and south and save for that peewit the blue sky was empty too
so help me said mr thomas marvel shuffling his coat on to his shoulders again
it's the drink
i might ha' known
it's not the drink said the voice
you keep your nerves steady
ow
said mr marvel and his face grew white amidst its patches
it's the drink
his lips repeated noiselessly
he remained staring about him rotating slowly backwards
i could have swore i heard a voice he whispered
of course you did
it's there again said mr marvel closing his eyes and clasping his hand on his brow with a tragic gesture
he was suddenly taken by the collar and shaken violently and left more dazed than ever
don't be a fool said the voice
i'moffmybloomingchump said mr marvel
it's no good
it's fretting about them blarsted boots
i'm off my blessed blooming chump
or it's spirits
neither one thing nor the other said the voice
listen
chump said mr marvel
one minute said the voice penetratingly tremulous with selfcontrol
well
said mr thomas marvel with a strange feeling of having been dug in the chest by a finger
you think i'm just imagination
just imagination
what else can you be
said mr thomas marvel rubbing the back of his neck
very well said the voice in a tone of relief
then i'm going to throw flints at you till you think differently
but where are yer
the voice made no answer
whizz came a flint apparently out of the air and missed mr marvel's shoulder by a hair'sbreadth
mr marvel turning saw a flint jerk up into the air trace a complicated path hang for a moment and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity
he was too amazed to dodge
whizz it came and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch
mr thomas marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud
then he started to run tripped over an unseen obstacle and came head over heels into a sitting position
now said the voice as a third stone curved upward and hung in the air above the tramp
am i imagination
mr marvel by way of reply struggled to his feet and was immediately rolled over again
he lay quiet for a moment
if you struggle any more said the voice i shall throw the flint at your head
it's a fair do said mr thomas marvel sitting up taking his wounded toe in hand and fixing his eye on the third missile
i don't understand it
stones flinging themselves
stones talking
put yourself down
rot away
i'm done
the third flint fell
it's very simple said the voice
i'm an invisible man
tell us something i don't know said mr marvel gasping with pain
where you've hidhow you do iti don't know
i'm beat
that's all said the voice
i'm invisible
that's what i want you to understand
anyone could see that
there is no need for you to be so confounded impatient mister
now then
give us a notion
how are you hid
i'm invisible
that's the great point
and what i want you to understand is this  but whereabouts
interrupted mr marvel
here
six yards in front of you
oh come
i ain't blind
you'll be telling me next you're just thin air
i'm not one of your ignorant tramps  yes i amthin air
you're looking through me
what
ain't there any stuff to you
vox etwhat is itjabber
is it that
i am just a human beingsolid needing food and drink needing covering toobut i'm invisible
you see
invisible
simple idea
invisible
what real like
yes real
let's have a hand of you said marvel if you are real
it won't be so darn outoftheway like thenlord
he said how you made me jumpgripping me like that
he felt the hand that had closed round his wrist with his disengaged fingers and his fingers went timorously up the arm patted a muscular chest and explored a bearded face
marvel's face was astonishment
i'm dashed
he said
if this don't beat cockfighting
most remarkableand there i can see a rabbit clean through you 'arf a mile away
not a bit of you visibleexcept  he scrutinised the apparently empty space keenly
you 'aven't been eatin' bread and cheese
he asked holding the invisible arm
you're quite right and it's not quite assimilated into the system
ah
said mr marvel
sort of ghostly though
of course all this isn't half so wonderful as you think
it's quite wonderful enough for my modest wants said mr thomas marvel
howjer manage it
how the dooce is it done
it's too long a story
and besides  i tell you the whole business fairly beats me said mr marvel
what i want to say at present is this i need help
i have come to thati came upon you suddenly
i was wandering mad with rage naked impotent
i could have murdered
and i saw you  lord
said mr marvel
i came up behind youhesitatedwent on  mr marvel's expression was eloquent  
then stopped
'here' i said 'is an outcast like myself
this is the man for me'
so i turned back and came to youyou
and  lord
said mr marvel
but i'm all in a tizzy
may i askhow is it
and what you may be requiring in the way of helpinvisible
i want you to help me get clothesand shelterand then with other things
i've left them long enough
if you won'twell
but you willmust
look here said mr marvel
i'm too flabbergasted
don't knock me about any more
and leave me go
i must get steady a bit
and you've pretty near broken my toe
it's all so unreasonable
empty downs empty sky
nothing visible for miles except the bosom of nature
and then comes a voice
a voice out of heaven
and stones
and a fistlord
pull yourself together said the voice for you have to do the job i've chosen for you
mr marvel blew out his cheeks and his eyes were round
i've chosen you said the voice
you are the only man except some of those fools down there who knows there is such a thing as an invisible man
you have to be my helper
help meand i will do great things for you
an invisible man is a man of power
he stopped for a moment to sneeze violently
but if you betray me he said if you fail to do as i direct you he paused and tapped mr marvel's shoulder smartly
mr marvel gave a yelp of terror at the touch
i don't want to betray you said mr marvel edging away from the direction of the fingers
don't you go athinking that whatever you do
all i want to do is to help youjust tell me what i got to do
lord
whatever you want done that i'm most willing to do
chapter x  mr marvel's visit to iping   after the first gusty panic had spent itself iping became argumentative
scepticism suddenly reared its headrather nervous scepticism not at all assured of its back but scepticism nevertheless
it is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air or felt the strength of his arm could be counted on the fingers of two hands
and of these witnesses mr wadgers was presently missing having retired impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house and jaffers was lying stunned in the parlour of the coach and horses
great and strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than smaller more tangible considerations
iping was gay with bunting and everybody was in gala dress
whit monday had been looked forward to for a month or more
by the afternoon even those who believed in the unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion on the supposition that he had quite gone away and with the sceptics he was already a jest
but people sceptics and believers alike were remarkably sociable all that day
haysman's meadow was gay with a tent in which mrs bunting and other ladies were preparing tea while without the sundayschool children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and the misses cuss and sackbut
no doubt there was a slight uneasiness in the air but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they experienced
on the village green an inclined strong rope
 down which clinging the while to a pulleyswung handle one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end came in for considerable favour among the adolescents as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies
there was also promenading and the steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music
members of the club who had attended church in the morning were splendid in badges of pink and green and some of the gayerminded had also adorned their bowler hats with brilliantcoloured favours of ribbon
old fletcher whose conceptions of holidaymaking were severe was visible through the jasmine about his window or through the open door whichever way you chose to look poised delicately on a plank supported on two chairs and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room
about four o'clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of the downs
he was a short stout person in an extraordinarily shabby top hat and he appeared to be very much out of breath
his cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed
his mottled face was apprehensive and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity
he turned the corner of the church and directed his way to the coach and horses
among others old fletcher remembers seeing him and indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him
this stranger to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut shy appeared to be talking to himself and mr huxter remarked the same thing
he stopped at the foot of the coach and horses steps and according to mr huxter appeared to undergo a severe internal struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house
finally he marched up the steps and was seen by mr huxter to turn to the left and open the door of the parlour
mr huxter heard voices from within the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error
that room's private
said hall and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went into the bar
in the course of a few minutes he reappeared wiping his lips with the back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow impressed mr huxter as assumed
he stood looking about him for some moments and then mr huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner towards the gates of the yard upon which the parlour window opened
the stranger after some hesitation leant against one of the gateposts produced a short clay pipe and prepared to fill it
his fingers trembled while doing so
he lit it clumsily and folding his arms began to smoke in a languid attitude an attitude which his occasional glances up the yard altogether belied
all this mr huxter saw over the canisters of the tobacco window and the singularity of the man's behaviour prompted him to maintain his observation
presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket
then he vanished into the yard
forthwith mr huxter conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief
as he did so mr marvel reappeared his hat askew a big bundle in a blue tablecloth in one hand and three books tied togetheras it proved afterwards with the vicar's bracesin the other
directly he saw huxter he gave a sort of gasp and turning sharply to the left began to run
stop thief
cried huxter and set off after him
mr huxter's sensations were vivid but brief
he saw the man just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road
he saw the village flags and festivities beyond and a face or so turned towards him
he bawled stop
again
he had hardly gone ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion and he was no longer running but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air
he saw the ground suddenly close to his face
the world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light and subsequent proceedings interested him no more
chapter xi  in the coach and horses   now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn it is necessary to go back to the moment when mr marvel first came into view of mr huxter's window
at that precise moment mr cuss and mr bunting were in the parlour
they were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning and were with mr hall's permission making a thorough examination of the invisible man's belongings
jaffers had partially recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his sympathetic friends
the stranger's scattered garments had been removed by mrs hall and the room tidied up
and on the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work cuss had hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled diary
diary
said cuss putting the three books on the table
now at any rate we shall learn something
the vicar stood with his hands on the table
diary repeated cuss sitting down putting two volumes to support the third and opening it
h'mno name on the flyleaf
bothercypher
and figures
the vicar came round to look over his shoulder
cuss turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed
i'mdear me
it's all cypher bunting
there are no diagrams
asked mr bunting
no illustrations throwing light  see for yourself said mr cuss
some of it's mathematical and some of it's russian or some such language to judge by the letters and some of it's greek
now the greek i thought you  of course said mr bunting taking out and wiping his spectacles and feeling suddenly very uncomfortablefor he had no greek left in his mind worth talking about yesthe greek of course may furnish a clue
i'll find you a place
i'd rather glance through the volumes first said mr bunting still wiping
a general impression first cuss and then you know we can go looking for clues
he coughed put on his glasses arranged them fastidiously coughed again and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure
then he took the volume cuss handed him in a leisurely manner
and then something did happen
the door opened suddenly
both gentlemen started violently looked round and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat
tap
asked the face and stood staring
no said both gentlemen at once
over the other side my man said mr bunting
and please shut that door said mr cuss irritably
all right said the intruder as it seemed in a low voice curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry
right you are said the intruder in the former voice
stand clear
and he vanished and closed the door
a sailor i should judge said mr bunting
amusing fellows they are
stand clear
indeed
a nautical term referring to his getting back out of the room i suppose
i daresay so said cuss
my nerves are all loose today
it quite made me jumpthe door opening like that
mr bunting smiled as if he had not jumped
and now he said with a sigh these books
someone sniffed as he did so
one thing is indisputable said bunting drawing up a chair next to that of cuss
there certainly have been very strange things happen in iping during the last few daysvery strange
i cannot of course believe in this absurd invisibility story  it's incredible said cussincredible
but the fact remains that i sawi certainly saw right down his sleeve  but did youare you sure
suppose a mirror for instance hallucinations are so easily produced
i don't know if you have ever seen a really good conjuror  i won't argue again said cuss
we've thrashed that out bunting
and just now there's these booksah
here's some of what i take to be greek
greek letters certainly
he pointed to the middle of the page
mr bunting flushed slightly and brought his face nearer apparently finding some difficulty with his glasses
suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of his neck
he tried to raise his head and encountered an immovable resistance
the feeling was a curious pressure the grip of a heavy firm hand and it bore his chin irresistibly to the table
don't move little men whispered a voice or i'll brain you both
he looked into the face of cuss close to his own and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly astonishment
i'm sorry to handle you so roughly said the voice but it's unavoidable
since when did you learn to pry into an investigator's private memoranda said the voice and two chins struck the table simultaneously and two sets of teeth rattled
since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in misfortune
and the concussion was repeated
where have they put my clothes
listen said the voice
the windows are fastened and i've taken the key out of the door
i am a fairly strong man and i have the poker handybesides being invisible
there's not the slightest doubt that i could kill you both and get away quite easily if i wanted todo you understand
very well
if i let you go will you promise not to try any nonsense and do what i tell you
the vicar and the doctor looked at one another and the doctor pulled a face
yes said mr bunting and the doctor repeated it
then the pressure on the necks relaxed and the doctor and the vicar sat up both very red in the face and wriggling their heads
please keep sitting where you are said the invisible man
here's the poker you see
when i came into this room continued the invisible man after presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors i did not expect to find it occupied and i expected to find in addition to my books of memoranda an outfit of clothing
where is it
nodon't rise
i can see it's gone
now just at present though the days are quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark the evenings are quite chilly
i want clothingand other accommodation and i must also have those three books
chapter xii  the invisible man loses his temper   it is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off again for a certain very painful reason that will presently be apparent
while these things were going on in the parlour and while mr huxter was watching mr marvel smoking his pipe against the gate not a dozen yards away were mr hall and teddy henfrey discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one iping topic
suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour a sharp cry and thensilence
hullo
said teddy henfrey
hullo
from the tap
mr hall took things in slowly but surely
that ain't right he said and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door
he and teddy approached the door together with intent faces
their eyes considered
summat wrong said hall and henfrey nodded agreement
whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them and there was a muffled sound of conversation very rapid and subdued
you all right thur
asked hall rapping
the muttered conversation ceased abruptly for a moment silence then the conversation was resumed in hissing whispers then a sharp cry of no
no you don't
there came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a chair a brief struggle
silence again
what the dooce
exclaimed henfrey sotto voce
youallright thur
asked mr hall sharply again
the vicar's voice answered with a curious jerking intonation quite riright
please don'tinterrupt
odd
said mr henfrey
odd
said mr hall
says 'don't interrupt' said henfrey
i heerd'n said hall
and a sniff said henfrey
they remained listening
the conversation was rapid and subdued
i can't said mr bunting his voice rising i tell you sir i will not
what was that
asked henfrey
says he wi' nart said hall
warn't speaking to us wuz he
disgraceful
said mr bunting within
'disgraceful' said mr henfrey
i heard itdistinct
who's that speaking now
asked henfrey
mr cuss i s'pose said hall
can you hearanything
silence
the sounds within indistinct and perplexing
sounds like throwing the tablecloth about said hall
mrs hall appeared behind the bar
hall made gestures of silence and invitation
this aroused mrs hall's wifely opposition
what yer listenin' there for hall
she asked
ain't you nothin' better to dobusy day like this
hall tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show but mrs hall was obdurate
she raised her voice
so hall and henfrey rather crestfallen tiptoed back to the bar gesticulating to explain to her
at first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all
then she insisted on hall keeping silence while henfrey told her his story
she was inclined to think the whole business nonsenseperhaps they were just moving the furniture about
i heerd'n say 'disgraceful' that i did said hall
i heerd that mrs hall said henfrey
like as not began mrs hall
hsh
said mr teddy henfrey
didn't i hear the window
what window
asked mrs hall
parlour window said henfrey
everyone stood listening intently
mrs hall's eyes directed straight before her saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the inn door the road white and vivid and huxter's shopfront blistering in the june sun
abruptly huxter's door opened and huxter appeared eyes staring with excitement arms gesticulating
yap
cried huxter
stop thief
and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates and vanished
simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour and a sound of windows being closed
hall henfrey and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once pellmell into the street
they saw someone whisk round the corner towards the road and mr huxter executing a complicated leap in the air that ended on his face and shoulder
down the street people were standing astonished or running towards them
mr huxter was stunned
henfrey stopped to discover this but hall and the two labourers from the tap rushed at once to the corner shouting incoherent things and saw mr marvel vanishing by the corner of the church wall
they appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion that this was the invisible man suddenly become visible and set off at once along the lane in pursuit
but hall had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong sideways clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the ground
he had been charged just as one charges a man at football
the second labourer came round in a circle stared and conceiving that hall had tumbled over of his own accord turned to resume the pursuit only to be tripped by the ankle just as huxter had been
then as the first labourer struggled to his feet he was kicked sideways by a blow that might have felled an ox
as he went down the rush from the direction of the village green came round the corner
the first to appear was the proprietor of the cocoanut shy a burly man in a blue jersey
he was astonished to see the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the ground
and then something happened to his rearmost foot and he went headlong and rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet of his brother and partner following headlong
the two were then kicked knelt on fallen over and cursed by quite a number of overhasty people
now when hall and henfrey and the labourers ran out of the house mrs hall who had been disciplined by years of experience remained in the bar next the till
and suddenly the parlour door was opened and mr cuss appeared and without glancing at her rushed at once down the steps toward the corner
hold him
he cried
don't let him drop that parcel
he knew nothing of the existence of marvel
for the invisible man had handed over the books and bundle in the yard
the face of mr cuss was angry and resolute but his costume was defective a sort of limp white kilt that could only have passed muster in greece
hold him
he bawled
he's got my trousers
and every stitch of the vicar's clothes
'tend to him in a minute
he cried to henfrey as he passed the prostrate huxter and coming round the corner to join the tumult was promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl
somebody in full flight trod heavily on his finger
he yelled struggled to regain his feet was knocked against and thrown on all fours again and became aware that he was involved not in a capture but a rout
everyone was running back to the village
he rose again and was hit severely behind the ear
he staggered and set off back to the coach and horses forthwith leaping over the deserted huxter who was now sitting up on his way
behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of rage rising sharply out of the confusion of cries and a sounding smack in someone's face
he recognised the voice as that of the invisible man and the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a painful blow
in another moment mr cuss was back in the parlour
he's coming back bunting
he said rushing in
save yourself
mr bunting was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to clothe himself in the hearthrug and a west surrey gazette
who's coming
he said so startled that his costume narrowly escaped disintegration
invisible man said cuss and rushed on to the window
we'd better clear out from here
he's fighting mad
mad
in another moment he was out in the yard
good heavens
said mr bunting hesitating between two horrible alternatives
he heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn and his decision was made
he clambered out of the window adjusted his costume hastily and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs would carry him
from the moment when the invisible man screamed with rage and mr bunting made his memorable flight up the village it became impossible to give a consecutive account of affairs in iping
possibly the invisible man's original intention was simply to cover marvel's retreat with the clothes and books
but his temper at no time very good seems to have gone completely at some chance blow and forthwith he set to smiting and overthrowing for the mere satisfaction of hurting
you must figure the street full of running figures of doors slamming and fights for hidingplaces
you must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old fletcher's planks and two chairswith cataclysmic results
you must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing
and then the whole tumultuous rush has passed and the iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen and littered with cocoanuts overthrown canvas screens and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall
everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow in the corner of a window pane
the invisible man amused himself for a little while by breaking all the windows in the coach and horses and then he thrust a street lamp through the parlour window of mrs gribble
he it must have been who cut the telegraph wire to adderdean just beyond higgins' cottage on the adderdean road
and after that as his peculiar qualities allowed he passed out of human perceptions altogether and he was neither heard seen nor felt in iping any more
he vanished absolutely
but it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured out again into the desolation of iping street
chapter xiii  mr marvel discusses his resignation   when the dusk was gathering and iping was just beginning to peep timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its bank holiday a short thickset man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to bramblehurst
he carried three books bound together by some sort of ornamental elastic ligature and a bundle wrapped in a blue tablecloth
his rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue he appeared to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry
he was accompanied by a voice other than his own and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands
if you give me the slip again said the voice if you attempt to give me the slip again  lord
said mr marvel
that shoulder's a mass of bruises as it is
on my honour said the voice i will kill you
i didn't try to give you the slip said marvel in a voice that was not far remote from tears
i swear i didn't
i didn't know the blessed turning that was all
how the devil was i to know the blessed turning
as it is i've been knocked about  you'll get knocked about a great deal more if you don't mind said the voice and mr marvel abruptly became silent
he blew out his cheeks and his eyes were eloquent of despair
it's bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little secret without your cutting off with my books
it's lucky for some of them they cut and ran when they did
here am i  no one knew i was invisible
and now what am i to do
what am i to do
asked marvel sotto voce
it's all about
it will be in the papers
everybody will be looking for me everyone on their guard the voice broke off into vivid curses and ceased
the despair of mr marvel's face deepened and his pace slackened
go on
said the voice
mr marvel's face assumed a greyish tint between the ruddier patches
don't drop those books stupid said the voice sharplyovertaking him
the fact is said the voice i shall have to make use of you you're a poor tool but i must
i'm a miserable tool said marvel
you are said the voice
i'm the worst possible tool you could have said marvel
i'm not strong he said after a discouraging silence
i'm not over strong he repeated
no
and my heart's weak
that little businessi pulled it through of coursebut bless you
i could have dropped
well
i haven't the nerve and strength for the sort of thing you want
i'll stimulate you
i wish you wouldn't
i wouldn't like to mess up your plans you know
but i mightout of sheer funk and misery
you'd better not said the voice with quiet emphasis
i wish i was dead said marvel
it ain't justice he said you must admit
it seems to me i've a perfect right  get on
said the voice
mr marvel mended his pace and for a time they went in silence again
it's devilish hard said mr marvel
this was quite ineffectual
he tried another tack
what do i make by it
he began again in a tone of unendurable wrong
oh
shut up
said the voice with sudden amazing vigour
i'll see to you all right
you do what you're told
you'll do it all right
you're a fool and all that but you'll do  i tell you sir i'm not the man for it
respectfullybut it is so  if you don't shut up i shall twist your wrist again said the invisible man
i want to think
presently two oblongs of yellow light appeared through the trees and the square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming
i shall keep my hand on your shoulder said the voice all through the village
go straight through and try no foolery
it will be the worse for you if you do
i know that sighed mr marvel i know all that
the unhappylooking figure in the obsolete silk hat passed up the street of the little village with his burdens and vanished into the gathering darkness beyond the lights of the windows
chapter xiv  at port stowe   ten o'clock the next morning found mr marvel unshaven dirty and travelstained sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in his pockets looking very weary nervous and uncomfortable and inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals on the bench outside a little inn on the outskirts of port stowe
beside him were the books but now they were tied with string
the bundle had been abandoned in the pinewoods beyond bramblehurst in accordance with a change in the plans of the invisible man
mr marvel sat on the bench and although no one took the slightest notice of him his agitation remained at fever heat
his hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling
when he had been sitting for the best part of an hour however an elderly mariner carrying a newspaper came out of the inn and sat down beside him
pleasant day said the mariner
mr marvel glanced about him with something very like terror
very he said
just seasonable weather for the time of year said the mariner taking no denial
quite said mr marvel
the mariner produced a toothpick and saving his regard was engrossed thereby for some minutes
his eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine mr marvel's dusty figure and the books beside him
as he had approached mr marvel he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket
he was struck by the contrast of mr marvel's appearance with this suggestion of opulence
thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination
books
he said suddenly noisily finishing with the toothpick
mr marvel started and looked at them
oh yes he said
yes they're books
there's some extraordinary things in books said the mariner
i believe you said mr marvel
and some extraordinary things out of 'em said the mariner
true likewise said mr marvel
he eyed his interlocutor and then glanced about him
there's some extraordinary things in newspapers for example said the mariner
there are
in this newspaper said the mariner
ah
said mr marvel
there's a story said the mariner fixing mr marvel with an eye that was firm and deliberate there's a story about an invisible man for instance
mr marvel pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears glowing
what will they be writing next
he asked faintly
ostria or america
neither said the mariner
here
lord
said mr marvel starting
when i say here said the mariner to mr marvel's intense relief i don't of course mean here in this place i mean hereabouts
an invisible man
said mr marvel
and what's he been up to
everything said the mariner controlling marvel with his eye and then amplifying everyblessedthing
i ain't seen a paper these four days said marvel
iping's the place he started at said the mariner
indeed
said mr marvel
he started there
and where he came from nobody don't seem to know
here it is 'peculiar story from iping'
and it says in this paper that the evidence is extraordinary strongextraordinary
lord
said mr marvel
but then it's an extraordinary story
there is a clergyman and a medical gent witnessessaw 'im all right and properor leastways didn't see 'im
he was staying it says at the 'coach an' horses' and no one don't seem to have been aware of his misfortune it says aware of his misfortune until in an altercation in the inn it says his bandages on his head was torn off
it was then observed that his head was invisible
attempts were at once made to secure him but casting off his garments it says he succeeded in escaping but not until after a desperate struggle in which he had inflicted serious injuries it says on our worthy and able constable mr j
a jaffers
pretty straight story eh
names and everything
lord
said mr marvel looking nervously about him trying to count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch and full of a strange and novel idea
it sounds most astonishing
don't it
extraordinary i call it
never heard tell of invisible men before i haven't but nowadays one hears such a lot of extraordinary thingsthat  that all he did
asked marvel trying to seem at his ease
it's enough ain't it
said the mariner
didn't go back by any chance
asked marvel
just escaped and that's all eh
all
said the mariner
whyain't it enough
quite enough said marvel
i should think it was enough said the mariner
i should think it was enough
he didn't have any palsit don't say he had any pals does it
asked mr marvel anxious
ain't one of a sort enough for you
asked the mariner
no thank heaven as one might say he didn't
he nodded his head slowly
it makes me regular uncomfortable the bare thought of that chap running about the country
he is at present at large and from certain evidence it is supposed that he hastakentook i suppose they meanthe road to port stowe
you see we're right in it
none of your american wonders this time
and just think of the things he might do
where'd you be if he took a drop over and above and had a fancy to go for you
suppose he wants to robwho can prevent him
he can trespass he can burgle he could walk through a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a blind man
easier
for these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp i'm told
and wherever there was liquor he fancied  he's got a tremenjous advantage certainly said mr marvel
andwell  you're right said the mariner
he has
all this time mr marvel had been glancing about him intently listening for faint footfalls trying to detect imperceptible movements
he seemed on the point of some great resolution
he coughed behind his hand
he looked about him again listened bent towards the mariner and lowered his voice the fact of it isi happento know just a thing or two about this invisible man
from private sources
oh
said the mariner interested
you
yes said mr marvel
me
indeed
said the mariner
and may i ask  you'll be astonished said mr marvel behind his hand
it's tremenjous
indeed
said the mariner
the fact is began mr marvel eagerly in a confidential undertone
suddenly his expression changed marvellously
ow
he said
he rose stiffly in his seat
his face was eloquent of physical suffering
wow
he said
what's up
said the mariner concerned
toothache said mr marvel and put his hand to his ear
he caught hold of his books
i must be getting on i think he said
he edged in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor
but you was just agoing to tell me about this here invisible man
protested the mariner
mr marvel seemed to consult with himself
hoax said a voice
it's a hoax said mr marvel
but it's in the paper said the mariner
hoax all the same said marvel
i know the chap that started the lie
there ain't no invisible man whatsoeverblimey
but how 'bout this paper
d'you mean to say
not a word of it said marvel stoutly
the mariner stared paper in hand
mr marvel jerkily faced about
wait a bit said the mariner rising and speaking slowly d'you mean to say
i do said mr marvel
then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff then
what d'yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that for
eh
mr marvel blew out his cheeks
the mariner was suddenly very red indeed he clenched his hands
i been talking here this ten minutes he said and you you little potbellied leatheryfaced son of an old boot couldn't have the elementary manners  don't you come bandying words with me said mr marvel
bandying words
i'm a jolly good mind  come up said a voice and mr marvel was suddenly whirled about and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner
you'd better move on said the mariner
who's moving on
said mr marvel
he was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait with occasional violent jerks forward
some way along the road he began a muttered monologue protests and recriminations
silly devil
said the mariner legs wide apart elbows akimbo watching the receding figure
i'll show you you silly asshoaxing me
it's hereon the paper
mr marvel retorted incoherently and receding was hidden by a bend in the road but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the way until the approach of a butcher's cart dislodged him
then he turned himself towards port stowe
full of extraordinary asses he said softly to himself
just to take me down a bitthat was his silly gameit's on the paper
and there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear that had happened quite close to him
and that was a vision of a fist full of money no less travelling without visible agency along by the wall at the corner of st michael's lane
a brother mariner had seen this wonderful sight that very morning
he had snatched at the money forthwith and had been knocked headlong and when he had got to his feet the butterfly money had vanished
our mariner was in the mood to believe anything he declared but that was a bit too stiff
afterwards however he began to think things over
the story of the flying money was true
and all about that neighbourhood even from the august london and country banking company from the tills of shops and innsdoors standing that sunny weather entirely openmoney had been quietly and dexterously making off that day in handfuls and rouleaux floating quietly along by walls and shady places dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of men
and it had though no man had traced it invariably ended its mysterious flight in the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk hat sitting outside the little inn on the outskirts of port stowe
it was ten days afterand indeed only when the burdock story was already oldthat the mariner collated these facts and began to understand how near he had been to the wonderful invisible man
chapter xv  the man who was running   in the early evening time dr kemp was sitting in his study in the belvedere on the hill overlooking burdock
it was a pleasant little room with three windowsnorth west and southand bookshelves covered with books and scientific publications and a broad writingtable and under the north window a microscope glass slips minute instruments some cultures and scattered bottles of reagents
dr kemp's solar lamp was lit albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light and his blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down
dr kemp was a tall and slender young man with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white and the work he was upon would earn him he hoped the fellowship of the royal society so highly did he think of it
and his eye presently wandering from his work caught the sunset blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own
for a minute perhaps he sat pen in mouth admiring the rich golden colour above the crest and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man inky black running over the hillbrow towards him
he was a shortish little man and he wore a high hat and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled
another of those fools said dr kemp
like that ass who ran into me this morning round a corner with the ''visible man acoming sir'
i can't imagine what possesses people
one might think we were in the thirteenth century
he got up went to the window and stared at the dusky hillside and the dark little figure tearing down it
he seems in a confounded hurry said dr kemp but he doesn't seem to be getting on
if his pockets were full of lead he couldn't run heavier
spurted sir said dr kemp
in another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the hill from burdock had occulted the running figure
he was visible again for a moment and again and then again three times between the three detached houses that came next and then the terrace hid him
asses
said dr kemp swinging round on his heel and walking back to his writingtable
but those who saw the fugitive nearer and perceived the abject terror on his perspiring face being themselves in the open roadway did not share in the doctor's contempt
by the man pounded and as he ran he chinked like a wellfilled purse that is tossed to and fro
he looked neither to the right nor the left but his dilated eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were being lit and the people were crowded in the street
and his illshaped mouth fell apart and a glairy foam lay on his lips and his breath came hoarse and noisy
all he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste
and then presently far up the hill a dog playing in the road yelped and ran under a gate and as they still wondered somethinga winda pad pad pada sound like a panting breathing rushed by
people screamed
people sprang off the pavement it passed in shouts it passed by instinct down the hill
they were shouting in the street before marvel was halfway there
they were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them with the news
he heard it and made one last desperate spurt
fear came striding by rushed ahead of him and in a moment had seized the town
the invisible man is coming
the invisible man
chapter xvi  in the jolly cricketers   the jolly cricketers is just at the bottom of the hill where the tramlines begin
the barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman while a blackbearded man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese drank burton and conversed in american with a policeman off duty
what's the shouting about
said the anaemic cabman going off at a tangent trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the low window of the inn
somebody ran by outside
fire perhaps said the barman
footsteps approached running heavily the door was pushed open violently and marvel weeping and dishevelled his hat gone the neck of his coat torn open rushed in made a convulsive turn and attempted to shut the door
it was held half open by a strap
coming
he bawled his voice shrieking with terror
he's coming
the 'visible man
after me
for gawd's sake
'elp
'elp
'elp
shut the doors said the policeman
who's coming
what's the row
he went to the door released the strap and it slammed
the american closed the other door
lemme go inside said marvel staggering and weeping but still clutching the books
lemme go inside
lock me insomewhere
i tell you he's after me
i give him the slip
he said he'd kill me and he will
you're safe said the man with the black beard
the door's shut
what's it all about
lemme go inside said marvel and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and a shouting outside
hullo cried the policeman who's there
mr marvel began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors
he'll kill mehe's got a knife or something
for gawd's sake
here you are said the barman
come in here
and he held up the flap of the bar
mr marvel rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated
don't open the door he screamed
please don't open the door
where shall i hide
this this invisible man then
asked the man with the black beard with one hand behind him
i guess it's about time we saw him
the window of the inn was suddenly smashed in and there was a screaming and running to and fro in the street
the policeman had been standing on the settee staring out craning to see who was at the door
he got down with raised eyebrows
it's that he said
the barman stood in front of the barparlour door which was now locked on mr marvel stared at the smashed window and came round to the two other men
everything was suddenly quiet
i wish i had my truncheon said the policeman going irresolutely to the door
once we open in he comes
there's no stopping him
don't you be in too much hurry about that door said the anaemic cabman anxiously
draw the bolts said the man with the black beard and if he comes he showed a revolver in his hand
that won't do said the policeman that's murder
i know what country i'm in said the man with the beard
i'm going to let off at his legs
draw the bolts
not with that blinking thing going off behind me said the barman craning over the blind
very well said the man with the black beard and stooping down revolver ready drew them himself
barman cabman and policeman faced about
come in said the bearded man in an undertone standing back and facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him
no one came in the door remained closed
five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously they were still waiting and an anxious face peered out of the barparlour and supplied information
are all the doors of the house shut
asked marvel
he's going roundprowling round
he's as artful as the devil
good lord
said the burly barman
there's the back
just watch them doors
i say
he looked about him helplessly
the barparlour door slammed and they heard the key turn
there's the yard door and the private door
the yard door  he rushed out of the bar
in a minute he reappeared with a carvingknife in his hand
the yard door was open
he said and his fat underlip dropped
he may be in the house now
said the first cabman
he's not in the kitchen said the barman
there's two women there and i've stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer
and they don't think he's come in
they haven't noticed  have you fastened it
asked the first cabman
i'm out of frocks said the barman
the man with the beard replaced his revolver
and even as he did so the flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked and then with a tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the barparlour door burst open
they heard marvel squeal like a caught leveret and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue
the bearded man's revolver cracked and the lookingglass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down
as the barman entered the room he saw marvel curiously crumpled up and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen
the door flew open while the barman hesitated and marvel was dragged into the kitchen
there was a scream and a clatter of pans
marvel head down and lugging back obstinately was forced to the kitchen door and the bolts were drawn
then the policeman who had been trying to pass the barman rushed in followed by one of the cabmen gripped the wrist of the invisible hand that collared marvel was hit in the face and went reeling back
the door opened and marvel made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it
then the cabman collared something
i got him said the cabman
the barman's red hands came clawing at the unseen
here he is
said the barman
mr marvel released suddenly dropped to the ground and made an attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men
the struggle blundered round the edge of the door
the voice of the invisible man was heard for the first time yelling out sharply as the policeman trod on his foot
then he cried out passionately and his fists flew round like flails
the cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up kicked under the diaphragm
the door into the barparlour from the kitchen slammed and covered mr marvel's retreat
the men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air
where's he gone
cried the man with the beard
out
this way said the policeman stepping into the yard and stopping
a piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on the kitchen table
i'll show him shouted the man with the black beard and suddenly a steel barrel shone over the policeman's shoulder and five bullets had followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come
as he fired the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve so that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a wheel
a silence followed
five cartridges said the man with the black beard
that's the best of all
four aces and a joker
get a lantern someone and come and feel about for his body
chapter xvii  dr kemp's visitor   dr kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused him
crack crack crack they came one after the other
hullo
said dr kemp putting his pen into his mouth again and listening
who's letting off revolvers in burdock
what are the asses at now
he went to the south window threw it up and leaning out stared down on the network of windows beaded gaslamps and shops with its black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night
looks like a crowd down the hill he said by 'the cricketers' and remained watching
thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships' lights shone and the pier gloweda little illuminated facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light
the moon in its first quarter hung over the westward hill and the stars were clear and almost tropically bright
after five minutes during which his mind had travelled into a remote speculation of social conditions of the future and lost itself at last over the time dimension dr kemp roused himself with a sigh pulled down the window again and returned to his writing desk
it must have been about an hour after this that the frontdoor bell rang
he had been writing slackly and with intervals of abstraction since the shots
he sat listening
he heard the servant answer the door and waited for her feet on the staircase but she did not come
wonder what that was said dr kemp
he tried to resume his work failed got up went downstairs from his study to the landing rang and called over the balustrade to the housemaid as she appeared in the hall below
was that a letter
he asked
only a runaway ring sir she answered
i'm restless tonight he said to himself
he went back to his study and this time attacked his work resolutely
in a little while he was hard at work again and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of the clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill hurrying in the very centre of the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table
it was two o'clock before dr kemp had finished his work for the night
he rose yawned and went downstairs to bed
he had already removed his coat and vest when he noticed that he was thirsty
he took a candle and went down to the diningroom in search of a syphon and whiskey
dr kemp's scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man and as he recrossed the hall he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near the mat at the foot of the stairs
he went on upstairs and then it suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum might be
apparently some subconscious element was at work
at any rate he turned with his burden went back to the hall put down the syphon and whiskey and bending down touched the spot
without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying blood
he took up his burden again and returned upstairs looking about him and trying to account for the bloodspot
on the landing he saw something and stopped astonished
the doorhandle of his own room was bloodstained
he looked at his own hand
it was quite clean and then he remembered that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his study and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all
he went straight into his room his face quite calmperhaps a trifle more resolute than usual
his glance wandering inquisitively fell on the bed
on the counterpane was a mess of blood and the sheet had been torn
he had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to the dressingtable
on the further side the bedclothes were depressed as if someone had been recently sitting there
then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say good heavenskemp
but dr kemp was no believer in voices
he stood staring at the tumbled sheets
was that really a voice
he looked about again but noticed nothing further than the disordered and bloodstained bed
then he distinctly heard a movement across the room near the washhand stand
all men however highly educated retain some superstitious inklings
the feeling that is called eerie came upon him
he closed the door of the room came forward to the dressingtable and put down his burdens
suddenly with a start he perceived a coiled and bloodstained bandage of linen rag hanging in midair between him and the washhand stand
he stared at this in amazement
it was an empty bandage a bandage properly tied but quite empty
he would have advanced to grasp it but a touch arrested him and a voice speaking quite close to him
kemp
said the voice
eh
said kemp with his mouth open
keep your nerve said the voice
i'm an invisible man
kemp made no answer for a space simply stared at the bandage
invisible man he said
i am an invisible man repeated the voice
the story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed through kemp's brain
he does not appear to have been either very much frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment
realisation came later
i thought it was all a lie he said
the thought uppermost in his mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning
have you a bandage on
he asked
yes said the invisible man
oh
said kemp and then roused himself
i say
he said
but this is nonsense
it's some trick
he stepped forward suddenly and his hand extended towards the bandage met invisible fingers
he recoiled at the touch and his colour changed
keep steady kemp for god's sake
i want help badly
stop
the hand gripped his arm
he struck at it
kemp
cried the voice
kemp
keep steady
and the grip tightened
a frantic desire to free himself took possession of kemp
the hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed
he opened his mouth to shout and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth
the invisible man had him down grimly but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely
listen to reason will you
said the invisible man sticking to him in spite of a pounding in the ribs
by heaven
you'll madden me in a minute
lie still you fool
bawled the invisible man in kemp's ear
kemp struggled for another moment and then lay still
if you shout i'll smash your face said the invisible man relieving his mouth
i'm an invisible man
it's no foolishness and no magic
i really am an invisible man
and i want your help
i don't want to hurt you but if you behave like a frantic rustic i must
don't you remember me kemp
griffin of university college
let me get up said kemp
i'll stop where i am
and let me sit quiet for a minute
he sat up and felt his neck
i am griffin of university college and i have made myself invisible
i am just an ordinary mana man you have knownmade invisible
griffin
said kemp
griffin answered the voice
a younger student than you were almost an albino six feet high and broad with a pink and white face and red eyes who won the medal for chemistry
i am confused said kemp
my brain is rioting
what has this to do with griffin
i am griffin
kemp thought
it's horrible he said
but what devilry must happen to make a man invisible
it's no devilry
it's a process sane and intelligible enough  it's horrible
said kemp
how on earth
it's horrible enough
but i'm wounded and in pain and tired  great god
kemp you are a man
take it steady
give me some food and drink and let me sit down here
kemp stared at the bandage as it moved across the room then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed
it creaked and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so
he rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again
this beats ghosts he said and laughed stupidly
that's better
thank heaven you're getting sensible
or silly said kemp and knuckled his eyes
give me some whiskey
i'm near dead
it didn't feel so
where are you
if i get up shall i run into you
there
all right
whiskey
here
where shall i give it to you
the chair creaked and kemp felt the glass drawn away from him
he let go by an effort his instinct was all against it
it came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair
he stared at it in infinite perplexity
this isthis must behypnotism
you have suggested you are invisible
nonsense said the voice
it's frantic
listen to me
i demonstrated conclusively this morning began kemp that invisibility  never mind what you've demonstratedi'm starving said the voice and the night is chilly to a man without clothes
food
said kemp
the tumbler of whiskey tilted itself
yes said the invisible man rapping it down
have you a dressinggown
kemp made some exclamation in an undertone
he walked to a wardrobe and produced a robe of dingy scarlet
this do
he asked
it was taken from him
it hung limp for a moment in midair fluttered weirdly stood full and decorous buttoning itself and sat down in his chair
drawers socks slippers would be a comfort said the unseen curtly
and food
anything
but this is the insanest thing i ever was in in my life
he turned out his drawers for the articles and then went downstairs to ransack his larder
he came back with some cold cutlets and bread pulled up a light table and placed them before his guest
never mind knives said his visitor and a cutlet hung in midair with a sound of gnawing
invisible
said kemp and sat down on a bedroom chair
i always like to get something about me before i eat said the invisible man with a full mouth eating greedily
queer fancy
i suppose that wrist is all right said kemp
trust me said the invisible man
of all the strange and wonderful  exactly
but it's odd i should blunder into your house to get my bandaging
my first stroke of luck
anyhow i meant to sleep in this house tonight
you must stand that
it's a filthy nuisance my blood showing isn't it
quite a clot over there
gets visible as it coagulates i see
it's only the living tissue i've changed and only for as long as i'm alive
i've been in the house three hours
but how's it done
began kemp in a tone of exasperation
confound it
the whole businessit's unreasonable from beginning to end
quite reasonable said the invisible man
perfectly reasonable
he reached over and secured the whiskey bottle
kemp stared at the devouring dressing gown
a ray of candlelight penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder made a triangle of light under the left ribs
what were the shots
he asked
how did the shooting begin
there was a real fool of a mana sort of confederate of minecurse himwho tried to steal my money
has done so
is he invisible too
no
well
can't i have some more to eat before i tell you all that
i'm hungryin pain
and you want me to tell stories
kemp got up
you didn't do any shooting
he asked
not me said his visitor
some fool i'd never seen fired at random
a lot of them got scared
they all got scared at me
curse themi sayi want more to eat than this kemp
i'll see what there is to eat downstairs said kemp
not much i'm afraid
after he had done eating and he made a heavy meal the invisible man demanded a cigar
he bit the end savagely before kemp could find a knife and cursed when the outer leaf loosened
it was strange to see him smoking his mouth and throat pharynx and nares became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast
this blessed gift of smoking
he said and puffed vigorously
i'm lucky to have fallen upon you kemp
you must help me
fancy tumbling on you just now
i'm in a devilish scrapei've been mad i think
the things i have been through
but we will do things yet
let me tell you  he helped himself to more whiskey and soda
kemp got up looked about him and fetched a glass from his spare room
it's wildbut i suppose i may drink
you haven't changed much kemp these dozen years
you fair men don't
cool and methodicalafter the first collapse
i must tell you
we will work together
but how was it all done
said kemp and how did you get like this
for god's sake let me smoke in peace for a little while
and then i will begin to tell you
but the story was not told that night
the invisible man's wrist was growing painful he was feverish exhausted and his mind came round to brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn
he spoke in fragments of marvel he smoked faster his voice grew angry
kemp tried to gather what he could
he was afraid of me i could see that he was afraid of me said the invisible man many times over
he meant to give me the sliphe was always casting about
what a fool i was
the cur
i should have killed him
where did you get the money
asked kemp abruptly
the invisible man was silent for a space
i can't tell you tonight he said
he groaned suddenly and leant forward supporting his invisible head on invisible hands
kemp he said i've had no sleep for near three days except a couple of dozes of an hour or so
i must sleep soon
well have my roomhave this room
but how can i sleep
if i sleephe will get away
ugh
what does it matter
what's the shot wound
asked kemp abruptly
nothingscratch and blood
oh god
how i want sleep
why not
the invisible man appeared to be regarding kemp
because i've a particular objection to being caught by my fellowmen he said slowly
kemp started
fool that i am
said the invisible man striking the table smartly
i've put the idea into your head
chapter xviii  the invisible man sleeps   exhausted and wounded as the invisible man was he refused to accept kemp's word that his freedom should be respected
he examined the two windows of the bedroom drew up the blinds and opened the sashes to confirm kemp's statement that a retreat by them would be possible
outside the night was very quiet and still and the new moon was setting over the down
then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the two dressingroom doors to satisfy himself that these also could be made an assurance of freedom
finally he expressed himself satisfied
he stood on the hearth rug and kemp heard the sound of a yawn
i'm sorry said the invisible man if i cannot tell you all that i have done tonight
but i am worn out
it's grotesque no doubt
it's horrible
but believe me kemp in spite of your arguments of this morning it is quite a possible thing
i have made a discovery
i meant to keep it to myself
i can't
i must have a partner
and you we can do such things 
but tomorrow
now kemp i feel as though i must sleep or perish
kemp stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment
i suppose i must leave you he said
it'sincredible
three things happening like this overturning all my preconceptionswould make me insane
but it's real
is there anything more that i can get you
only bid me goodnight said griffin
goodnight said kemp and shook an invisible hand
he walked sideways to the door
suddenly the dressinggown walked quickly towards him
understand me
said the dressinggown
no attempts to hamper me or capture me
or  kemp's face changed a little
i thought i gave you my word he said
kemp closed the door softly behind him and the key was turned upon him forthwith
then as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his face the rapid feet came to the door of the dressingroom and that too was locked
kemp slapped his brow with his hand
am i dreaming
has the world gone mador have i
he laughed and put his hand to the locked door
barred out of my own bedroom by a flagrant absurdity
he said
he walked to the head of the staircase turned and stared at the locked doors
it's fact he said
he put his fingers to his slightly bruised neck
undeniable fact
but  he shook his head hopelessly turned and went downstairs
he lit the diningroom lamp got out a cigar and began pacing the room ejaculating
now and then he would argue with himself
invisible
he said
is there such a thing as an invisible animal

in the sea yes
thousandsmillions
all the larvae all the little nauplii and tornarias all the microscopic things the jellyfish
in the sea there are more things invisible than visible
i never thought of that before
and in the ponds too
all those little pondlife thingsspecks of colourless translucent jelly
but in air
no
it can't be
but after allwhy not
if a man was made of glass he would still be visible
his meditation became profound
the bulk of three cigars had passed into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he spoke again
then it was merely an exclamation
he turned aside walked out of the room and went into his little consultingroom and lit the gas there
it was a little room because dr kemp did not live by practice and in it were the day's newspapers
the morning's paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside
he caught it up turned it over and read the account of a strange story from iping that the mariner at port stowe had spelt over so painfully to mr marvel
kemp read it swiftly
wrapped up
said kemp
disguised
hiding it
'no one seems to have been aware of his misfortune'
what the devil is his game
he dropped the paper and his eye went seeking
ah
he said and caught up the st
james' gazette lying folded up as it arrived
now we shall get at the truth said dr kemp
he rent the paper open a couple of columns confronted him
an entire village in sussex goes mad was the heading
good heavens
said kemp reading eagerly an incredulous account of the events in iping of the previous afternoon that have already been described
over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been reprinted
he reread it
ran through the streets striking right and left
jaffers insensible
mr huxter in great painstill unable to describe what he saw
painful humiliationvicar
woman ill with terror
windows smashed
this extraordinary story probably a fabrication
too good not to printcum grano
he dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him
probably a fabrication
he caught up the paper again and reread the whole business
but when does the tramp come in
why the deuce was he chasing a tramp
he sat down abruptly on the surgical bench
he's not only invisible he said but he's mad
homicidal
when dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamplight and cigar smoke of the diningroom kemp was still pacing up and down trying to grasp the incredible
he was altogether too excited to sleep
his servants descending sleepily discovered him and were inclined to think that overstudy had worked this ill on him
he gave them extraordinary but quite explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere studyand then to confine themselves to the basement and groundfloor
then he continued to pace the diningroom until the morning's paper came
that had much to say and little to tell beyond the confirmation of the evening before and a very badly written account of another remarkable tale from port burdock
this gave kemp the essence of the happenings at the jolly cricketers and the name of marvel
he has made me keep with him twentyfour hours marvel testified
certain minor facts were added to the iping story notably the cutting of the village telegraphwire
but there was nothing to throw light on the connexion between the invisible man and the tramp for mr marvel had supplied no information about the three books or the money with which he was lined
the incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of reporters and inquirers were already at work elaborating the matter
kemp read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get every one of the morning papers she could
these also he devoured
he is invisible
he said
and it reads like rage growing to mania
the things he may do
the things he may do
and he's upstairs free as the air
what on earth ought i to do
for instance would it be a breach of faith if
no
he went to a little untidy desk in the corner and began a note
he tore this up half written and wrote another
he read it over and considered it
then he took an envelope and addressed it to colonel adye port burdock
the invisible man awoke even as kemp was doing this
he awoke in an evil temper and kemp alert for every sound heard his pattering feet rush suddenly across the bedroom overhead
then a chair was flung over and the washhand stand tumbler smashed
kemp hurried upstairs and rapped eagerly
chapter xix  certain first principles   what's the matter
asked kemp when the invisible man admitted him
nothing was the answer
but confound it
the smash
fit of temper said the invisible man
forgot this arm and it's sore
you're rather liable to that sort of thing
i am
kemp walked across the room and picked up the fragments of broken glass
all the facts are out about you said kemp standing up with the glass in his hand all that happened in iping and down the hill
the world has become aware of its invisible citizen
but no one knows you are here
the invisible man swore
the secret's out
i gather it was a secret
i don't know what your plans are but of course i'm anxious to help you
the invisible man sat down on the bed
there's breakfast upstairs said kemp speaking as easily as possible and he was delighted to find his strange guest rose willingly
kemp led the way up the narrow staircase to the belvedere
before we can do anything else said kemp i must understand a little more about this invisibility of yours
he had sat down after one nervous glance out of the window with the air of a man who has talking to do
his doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to where griffin sat at the breakfasttablea headless handless dressinggown wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette
it's simple enoughand credible enough said griffin putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand
no doubt to you but kemp laughed
well yes to me it seemed wonderful at first no doubt
but now great god

but we will do great things yet
i came on the stuff first at chesilstowe
chesilstowe
i went there after i left london
you know i dropped medicine and took up physics
no well i did
light fascinated me
ah
optical density
the whole subject is a network of riddlesa network with solutions glimmering elusively through
and being but twoandtwenty and full of enthusiasm i said 'i will devote my life to this
this is worth while'
you know what fools we are at twoandtwenty
fools then or fools now said kemp
as though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man
but i went to worklike a slave
and i had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenlyblindingly
i found a general principle of pigments and refractiona formula a geometrical expression involving four dimensions
fools common men even common mathematicians do not know anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics
in the booksthe books that tramp has hiddenthere are marvels miracles
but this was not a method it was an idea that might lead to a method by which it would be possible without changing any other property of matterexcept in some instances coloursto lower the refractive index of a substance solid or liquid to that of airso far as all practical purposes are concerned
phew
said kemp
that's odd
but still i don't see quite 
i can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone but personal invisibility is a far cry
precisely said griffin
but consider visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light
either a body absorbs light or it reflects or refracts it or does all these things
if it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light it cannot of itself be visible
you see an opaque red box for instance because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest all the red part of the light to you
if it did not absorb any particular part of the light but reflected it all then it would be a shining white box
silver
a diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucenciesa sort of skeleton of light
a glass box would not be so brilliant nor so clearly visible as a diamond box because there would be less refraction and reflection
see that
from certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it
some kinds of glass would be more visible than others a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass
a box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little
and if you put a sheet of common white glass in water still more if you put it in some denser liquid than water it would vanish almost altogether because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way
it is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air
and for precisely the same reason
yes said kemp that is pretty plain sailing
and here is another fact you will know to be true
if a sheet of glass is smashed kemp and beaten into a powder it becomes much more visible while it is in the air it becomes at last an opaque white powder
this is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur
in the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through and very little gets right through the powder
but if the white powdered glass is put into water it forthwith vanishes
the powdered glass and water have much the same refractive index that is the light undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one to the other
you make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the same refractive index a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index
and if you will consider only a second you will see also that the powder of glass might be made to vanish in air if its refractive index could be made the same as that of air for then there would be no refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to air
yes yes said kemp
but a man's not powdered glass
no said griffin
he's more transparent
nonsense
that from a doctor
how one forgets
have you already forgotten your physics in ten years
just think of all the things that are transparent and seem not to be so
paper for instance is made up of transparent fibres and it is white and opaque only for the same reason that a powder of glass is white and opaque
oil white paper fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces and it becomes as transparent as glass
and not only paper but cotton fibre linen fibre wool fibre woody fibre and bone kemp flesh kemp hair kemp nails and nerves kemp in fact the whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair are all made up of transparent colourless tissue
so little suffices to make us visible one to the other
for the most part the fibres of a living creature are no more opaque than water
great heavens
cried kemp
of course of course
i was thinking only last night of the sea larvae and all jellyfish
now you have me
and all that i knew and had in mind a year after i left londonsix years ago
but i kept it to myself
i had to do my work under frightful disadvantages
oliver my professor was a scientific bounder a journalist by instinct a thief of ideashe was always prying
and you know the knavish system of the scientific world
i simply would not publish and let him share my credit
i went on working i got nearer and nearer making my formula into an experiment a reality
i told no living soul because i meant to flash my work upon the world with crushing effect and become famous at a blow
i took up the question of pigments to fill up certain gaps
and suddenly not by design but by accident i made a discovery in physiology
yes
you know the red colouring matter of blood it can be made whitecolourlessand remain with all the functions it has now
kemp gave a cry of incredulous amazement
the invisible man rose and began pacing the little study
you may well exclaim
i remember that night
it was late at nightin the daytime one was bothered with the gaping silly studentsand i worked then sometimes till dawn
it came suddenly splendid and complete in my mind
i was alone the laboratory was still with the tall lights burning brightly and silently
in all my great moments i have been alone
'one could make an animala tissuetransparent
one could make it invisible
all except the pigmentsi could be invisible'
i said suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge
it was overwhelming
i left the filtering i was doing and went and stared out of the great window at the stars
'i could be invisible'
i repeated
to do such a thing would be to transcend magic
and i beheld unclouded by doubt a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a manthe mystery the power the freedom
drawbacks i saw none
you have only to think
and i a shabby povertystruck hemmedin demonstrator teaching fools in a provincial college might suddenly becomethis
i ask you kemp if you 
anyone i tell you would have flung himself upon that research
and i worked three years and every mountain of difficulty i toiled over showed another from its summit
the infinite details
and the exasperation
a professor a provincial professor always prying
'when are you going to publish this work of yours'
was his everlasting question
and the students the cramped means
three years i had of it  and after three years of secrecy and exasperation i found that to complete it was impossibleimpossible
how
asked kemp
money said the invisible man and went again to stare out of the window
he turned around abruptly
i robbed the old manrobbed my father
the money was not his and he shot himself
chapter xx  at the house in great portland street   for a moment kemp sat in silence staring at the back of the headless figure at the window
then he started struck by a thought rose took the invisible man's arm and turned him away from the outlook
you are tired he said and while i sit you walk about
have my chair
he placed himself between griffin and the nearest window
for a space griffin sat silent and then he resumed abruptly  i had left the chesilstowe cottage already he said when that happened
it was last december
i had taken a room in london a large unfurnished room in a big illmanaged lodginghouse in a slum near great portland street
the room was soon full of the appliances i had bought with his money the work was going on steadily successfully drawing near an end
i was like a man emerging from a thicket and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy
i went to bury him
my mind was still on this research and i did not lift a finger to save his character
i remember the funeral the cheap hearse the scant ceremony the windy frostbitten hillside and the old college friend of his who read the service over hima shabby black bent old man with a snivelling cold
i remember walking back to the empty house through the place that had once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry builders into the ugly likeness of a town
every way the roads ran out at last into the desecrated fields and ended in rubble heaps and rank wet weeds
i remember myself as a gaunt black figure going along the slippery shiny pavement and the strange sense of detachment i felt from the squalid respectability the sordid commercialism of the place
i did not feel a bit sorry for my father
he seemed to me to be the victim of his own foolish sentimentality
the current cant required my attendance at his funeral but it was really not my affair
but going along the high street my old life came back to me for a space for i met the girl i had known ten years since
our eyes met
something moved me to turn back and talk to her
she was a very ordinary person
it was all like a dream that visit to the old places
i did not feel then that i was lonely that i had come out from the world into a desolate place
i appreciated my loss of sympathy but i put it down to the general inanity of things
reentering my room seemed like the recovery of reality
there were the things i knew and loved
there stood the apparatus the experiments arranged and waiting
and now there was scarcely a difficulty left beyond the planning of details
i will tell you kemp sooner or later all the complicated processes
we need not go into that now
for the most part saving certain gaps i chose to remember they are written in cypher in those books that tramp has hidden
we must hunt him down
we must get those books again
but the essential phase was to place the transparent object whose refractive index was to be lowered between two radiating centres of a sort of ethereal vibration of which i will tell you more fully later
no not those roentgen vibrationsi don't know that these others of mine have been described
yet they are obvious enough
i needed two little dynamos and these i worked with a cheap gas engine
my first experiment was with a bit of white wool fabric
it was the strangest thing in the world to see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and white and then to watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish
i could scarcely believe i had done it
i put my hand into the emptiness and there was the thing as solid as ever
i felt it awkwardly and threw it on the floor
i had a little trouble finding it again
and then came a curious experience
i heard a miaow behind me and turning saw a lean white cat very dirty on the cistern cover outside the window
a thought came into my head
'everything ready for you' i said and went to the window opened it and called softly
she came in purringthe poor beast was starvingand i gave her some milk
all my food was in a cupboard in the corner of the room
after that she went smelling round the room evidently with the idea of making herself at home
the invisible rag upset her a bit you should have seen her spit at it
but i made her comfortable on the pillow of my trucklebed
and i gave her butter to get her to wash  and you processed her
i processed her
but giving drugs to a cat is no joke kemp
and the process failed
failed
in two particulars
these were the claws and the pigment stuff what is itat the back of the eye in a cat
you know
tapetum
yes the tapetum
it didn't go
after i'd given the stuff to bleach the blood and done certain other things to her i gave the beast opium and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on on the apparatus
and after all the rest had faded and vanished there remained two little ghosts of her eyes
odd
i can't explain it
she was bandaged and clamped of courseso i had her safe but she woke while she was still misty and miaowed dismally and someone came knocking
it was an old woman from downstairs who suspected me of vivisectinga drinksodden old creature with only a white cat to care for in all the world
i whipped out some chloroform applied it and answered the door
'did i hear a cat'
she asked
'my cat'
'not here' said i very politely
she was a little doubtful and tried to peer past me into the room strange enough to her no doubtbare walls uncurtained windows trucklebed with the gas engine vibrating and the seethe of the radiant points and that faint ghastly stinging of chloroform in the air
she had to be satisfied at last and went away again
how long did it take
asked kemp
three or four hoursthe cat
the bones and sinews and the fat were the last to go and the tips of the coloured hairs
and as i say the back part of the eye tough iridescent stuff it is wouldn't go at all
it was night outside long before the business was over and nothing was to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws
i stopped the gas engine felt for and stroked the beast which was still insensible and then being tired left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed
i found it hard to sleep
i lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff going over the experiment over and over again or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me until everything the ground i stood on vanished and so i came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets
about two the cat began miaowing about the room
i tried to hush it by talking to it and then i decided to turn it out
i remember the shock i had when striking a lightthere were just the round eyes shining greenand nothing round them
i would have given it milk but i hadn't any
it wouldn't be quiet it just sat down and miaowed at the door
i tried to catch it with an idea of putting it out of the window but it wouldn't be caught it vanished
then it began miaowing in different parts of the room
at last i opened the window and made a bustle
i suppose it went out at last
i never saw any more of it
thenheaven knows whyi fell thinking of my father's funeral again and the dismal windy hillside until the day had come
i found sleeping was hopeless and locking my door after me wandered out into the morning streets
you don't mean to say there's an invisible cat at large
said kemp
if it hasn't been killed said the invisible man
why not
why not
said kemp
i didn't mean to interrupt
it's very probably been killed said the invisible man
it was alive four days after i know and down a grating in great titchfield street because i saw a crowd round the place trying to see whence the miaowing came
he was silent for the best part of a minute
then he resumed abruptly  i remember that morning before the change very vividly
i must have gone up great portland street
i remember the barracks in albany street and the horse soldiers coming out and at last i found the summit of primrose hill
it was a sunny day in januaryone of those sunny frosty days that came before the snow this year
my weary brain tried to formulate the position to plot out a plan of action
i was surprised to find now that my prize was within my grasp how inconclusive its attainment seemed
as a matter of fact i was worked out the intense stress of nearly four years' continuous work left me incapable of any strength of feeling
i was apathetic and i tried in vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries the passion of discovery that had enabled me to compass even the downfall of my father's grey hairs
nothing seemed to matter
i saw pretty clearly this was a transient mood due to overwork and want of sleep and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies
all i could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried through the fixed idea still ruled me
and soon for the money i had was almost exhausted
i looked about me at the hillside with children playing and girls watching them and tried to think of all the fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world
after a time i crawled home took some food and a strong dose of strychnine and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed
strychnine is a grand tonic kemp to take the flabbiness out of a man
it's the devil said kemp
it's the palaeolithic in a bottle
i awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable
you know
i know the stuff
and there was someone rapping at the door
it was my landlord with threats and inquiries an old polish jew in a long grey coat and greasy slippers
i had been tormenting a cat in the night he was surethe old woman's tongue had been busy
he insisted on knowing all about it
the laws in this country against vivisection were very severehe might be liable
i denied the cat
then the vibration of the little gas engine could be felt all over the house he said
that was true certainly
he edged round me into the room peering about over his germansilver spectacles and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry away something of my secret
i tried to keep between him and the concentrating apparatus i had arranged and that only made him more curious
what was i doing
why was i always alone and secretive
was it legal
was it dangerous
i paid nothing but the usual rent
his had always been a most respectable housein a disreputable neighbourhood
suddenly my temper gave way
i told him to get out
he began to protest to jabber of his right of entry
in a moment i had him by the collar something ripped and he went spinning out into his own passage
i slammed and locked the door and sat down quivering
he made a fuss outside which i disregarded and after a time he went away
but this brought matters to a crisis
i did not know what he would do nor even what he had the power to do
to move to fresh apartments would have meant delay altogether i had barely twenty pounds left in the world for the most part in a bankand i could not afford that
vanish
it was irresistible
then there would be an inquiry the sacking of my room
at the thought of the possibility of my work being exposed or interrupted at its very climax i became very angry and active
i hurried out with my three books of notes my chequebookthe tramp has them nowand directed them from the nearest post office to a house of call for letters and parcels in great portland street
i tried to go out noiselessly
coming in i found my landlord going quietly upstairs he had heard the door close i suppose
you would have laughed to see him jump aside on the landing as i came tearing after him
he glared at me as i went by him and i made the house quiver with the slamming of my door
i heard him come shuffling up to my floor hesitate and go down
i set to work upon my preparations forthwith
it was all done that evening and night
while i was still sitting under the sickly drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise blood there came a repeated knocking at the door
it ceased footsteps went away and returned and the knocking was resumed
there was an attempt to push something under the doora blue paper
then in a fit of irritation i rose and went and flung the door wide open
'now then'
said i
it was my landlord with a notice of ejectment or something
he held it out to me saw something odd about my hands i expect and lifted his eyes to my face
for a moment he gaped
then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry dropped candle and writ together and went blundering down the dark passage to the stairs
i shut the door locked it and went to the lookingglass
then i understood his terror my face was whitelike white stone
but it was all horrible
i had not expected the suffering
a night of racking anguish sickness and fainting
i set my teeth though my skin was presently afire all my body afire but i lay there like grim death
i understood now how it was the cat had howled until i chloroformed it
lucky it was i lived alone and untended in my room
there were times when i sobbed and groaned and talked
but i stuck to it
i became insensible and woke languid in the darkness
the pain had passed
i thought i was killing myself and i did not care
i shall never forget that dawn and the strange horror of seeing that my hands had become as clouded glass and watching them grow clearer and thinner as the day went by until at last i could see the sickly disorder of my room through them though i closed my transparent eyelids
my limbs became glassy the bones and arteries faded vanished and the little white nerves went last
i gritted my teeth and stayed there to the end
at last only the dead tips of the fingernails remained pallid and white and the brown stain of some acid upon my fingers
i struggled up
at first i was as incapable as a swathed infantstepping with limbs i could not see
i was weak and very hungry
i went and stared at nothing in my shavingglass at nothing save where an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes fainter than mist
i had to hang on to the table and press my forehead against the glass
it was only by a frantic effort of will that i dragged myself back to the apparatus and completed the process
i slept during the forenoon pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut out the light and about midday i was awakened again by a knocking
my strength had returned
i sat up and listened and heard a whispering
i sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began to detach the connections of my apparatus and to distribute it about the room so as to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement
presently the knocking was renewed and voices called first my landlord's and then two others
to gain time i answered them
the invisible rag and pillow came to hand and i opened the window and pitched them out on to the cistern cover
as the window opened a heavy crash came at the door
someone had charged it with the idea of smashing the lock
but the stout bolts i had screwed up some days before stopped him
that startled me made me angry
i began to tremble and do things hurriedly
i tossed together some loose paper straw packing paper and so forth in the middle of the room and turned on the gas
heavy blows began to rain upon the door
i could not find the matches
i beat my hands on the wall with rage
i turned down the gas again stepped out of the window on the cistern cover very softly lowered the sash and sat down secure and invisible but quivering with anger to watch events
they split a panel i saw and in another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway
it was the landlord and his two stepsons sturdy young men of three or four and twenty
behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from downstairs
you may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty
one of the younger men rushed to the window at once flung it up and stared out
his staring eyes and thicklipped bearded face came a foot from my face
i was half minded to hit his silly countenance but i arrested my doubled fist
he stared right through me
so did the others as they joined him
the old man went and peered under the bed and then they all made a rush for the cupboard
they had to argue about it at length in yiddish and cockney english
they concluded i had not answered them that their imagination had deceived them
a feeling of extraordinary elation took the place of my anger as i sat outside the window and watched these four peoplefor the old lady came in glancing suspiciously about her like a cat trying to understand the riddle of my behaviour
the old man so far as i could understand his patois agreed with the old lady that i was a vivisectionist
the sons protested in garbled english that i was an electrician and appealed to the dynamos and radiators
they were all nervous about my arrival although i found subsequently that they had bolted the front door
the old lady peered into the cupboard and under the bed and one of the young men pushed up the register and stared up the chimney
one of my fellow lodgers a costermonger who shared the opposite room with a butcher appeared on the landing and he was called in and told incoherent things
it occurred to me that the radiators if they fell into the hands of some acute welleducated person would give me away too much and watching my opportunity i came into the room and tilted one of the little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing and smashed both apparatus
then while they were trying to explain the smash i dodged out of the room and went softly downstairs
i went into one of the sittingrooms and waited until they came down still speculating and argumentative all a little disappointed at finding no 'horrors' and all a little puzzled how they stood legally towards me
then i slipped up again with a box of matches fired my heap of paper and rubbish put the chairs and bedding thereby led the gas to the affair by means of an indiarubber tube and waving a farewell to the room left it for the last time
you fired the house
exclaimed kemp
fired the house
it was the only way to cover my trailand no doubt it was insured
i slipped the bolts of the front door quietly and went out into the street
i was invisible and i was only just beginning to realise the extraordinary advantage my invisibility gave me
my head was already teeming with plans of all the wild and wonderful things i had now impunity to do
chapter xxi  in oxford street   in going downstairs the first time i found an unexpected difficulty because i could not see my feet indeed i stumbled twice and there was an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt
by not looking down however i managed to walk on the level passably well
my mood i say was one of exaltation
i felt as a seeing man might do with padded feet and noiseless clothes in a city of the blind
i experienced a wild impulse to jest to startle people to clap men on the back fling people's hats astray and generally revel in my extraordinary advantage
but hardly had i emerged upon great portland street however my lodging was close to the big draper's shop there when i heard a clashing concussion and was hit violently behind and turning saw a man carrying a basket of sodawater syphons and looking in amazement at his burden
although the blow had really hurt me i found something so irresistible in his astonishment that i laughed aloud
'the devil's in the basket' i said and suddenly twisted it out of his hand
he let go incontinently and i swung the whole weight into the air
but a fool of a cabman standing outside a public house made a sudden rush for this and his extending fingers took me with excruciating violence under the ear
i let the whole down with a smash on the cabman and then with shouts and the clatter of feet about me people coming out of shops vehicles pulling up i realised what i had done for myself and cursing my folly backed against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion
in a moment i should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered
i pushed by a butcher boy who luckily did not turn to see the nothingness that shoved him aside and dodged behind the cabman's fourwheeler
i do not know how they settled the business
i hurried straight across the road which was happily clear and hardly heeding which way i went in the fright of detection the incident had given me plunged into the afternoon throng of oxford street
i tried to get into the stream of people but they were too thick for me and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon
i took to the gutter the roughness of which i found painful to my feet and forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the shoulder blade reminding me that i was already bruised severely
i staggered out of the way of the cab avoided a perambulator by a convulsive movement and found myself behind the hansom
a happy thought saved me and as this drove slowly along i followed in its immediate wake trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure
and not only trembling but shivering
it was a bright day in january and i was stark naked and the thin slime of mud that covered the road was freezing
foolish as it seems to me now i had not reckoned that transparent or not i was still amenable to the weather and all its consequences
then suddenly a bright idea came into my head
i ran round and got into the cab
and so shivering scared and sniffing with the first intimations of a cold and with the bruises in the small of my back growing upon my attention i drove slowly along oxford street and past tottenham court road
my mood was as different from that in which i had sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is possible to imagine
this invisibility indeed
the one thought that possessed me washow was i to get out of the scrape i was in
we crawled past mudie's and there a tall woman with five or six yellowlabelled books hailed my cab and i sprang out just in time to escape her shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight
i made off up the roadway to bloomsbury square intending to strike north past the museum and so get into the quiet district
i was now cruelly chilled and the strangeness of my situation so unnerved me that i whimpered as i ran
at the northward corner of the square a little white dog ran out of the pharmaceutical society's offices and incontinently made for me nose down
i had never realised it before but the nose is to the mind of a dog what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man
dogs perceive the scent of a man moving as men perceive his vision
this brute began barking and leaping showing as it seemed to me only too plainly that he was aware of me
i crossed great russell street glancing over my shoulder as i did so and went some way along montague street before i realised what i was running towards
then i became aware of a blare of music and looking along the street saw a number of people advancing out of russell square red shirts and the banner of the salvation army to the fore
such a crowd chanting in the roadway and scoffing on the pavement i could not hope to penetrate and dreading to go back and farther from home again and deciding on the spur of the moment i ran up the white steps of a house facing the museum railings and stood there until the crowd should have passed
happily the dog stopped at the noise of the band too hesitated and turned tail running back to bloomsbury square again
on came the band bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about 'when shall we see his face'
and it seemed an interminable time to me before the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me
thud thud thud came the drum with a vibrating resonance and for the moment i did not notice two urchins stopping at the railings by me
'see 'em' said one
'see what'
said the other
'whythem footmarksbare
like what you makes in mud'
i looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping at the muddy footmarks i had left behind me up the newly whitened steps
the passing people elbowed and jostled them but their confounded intelligence was arrested
'thud thud thud when thud shall we see thud his face thud thud'
'there's a barefoot man gone up them steps or i don't know nothing' said one
'and he ain't never come down again
and his foot was ableeding'
the thick of the crowd had already passed
'looky there ted' quoth the younger of the detectives with the sharpness of surprise in his voice and pointed straight to my feet
i looked down and saw at once the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud
for a moment i was paralysed
'why that's rum' said the elder
'dashed rum
it's just like the ghost of a foot ain't it'
he hesitated and advanced with outstretched hand
a man pulled up short to see what he was catching and then a girl
in another moment he would have touched me
then i saw what to do
i made a step the boy started back with an exclamation and with a rapid movement i swung myself over into the portico of the next house
but the smaller boy was sharpeyed enough to follow the movement and before i was well down the steps and upon the pavement he had recovered from his momentary astonishment and was shouting out that the feet had gone over the wall
they rushed round and saw my new footmarks flash into being on the lower step and upon the pavement
'what's up'
asked someone
'feet
look
feet running'
everybody in the road except my three pursuers was pouring along after the salvation army and this blow not only impeded me but them
there was an eddy of surprise and interrogation
at the cost of bowling over one young fellow i got through and in another moment i was rushing headlong round the circuit of russell square with six or seven astonished people following my footmarks
there was no time for explanation or else the whole host would have been after me
twice i doubled round corners thrice i crossed the road and came back upon my tracks and then as my feet grew hot and dry the damp impressions began to fade
at last i had a breathing space and rubbed my feet clean with my hands and so got away altogether
the last i saw of the chase was a little group of a dozen people perhaps studying with infinite perplexity a slowly drying footprint that had resulted from a puddle in tavistock square a footprint as isolated and incomprehensible to them as crusoe's solitary discovery
this running warmed me to a certain extent and i went on with a better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts
my back had now become very stiff and sore my tonsils were painful from the cabman's fingers and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his nails my feet hurt exceedingly and i was lame from a little cut on one foot
i saw in time a blind man approaching me and fled limping for i feared his subtle intuitions
once or twice accidental collisions occurred and i left people amazed with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears
then came something silent and quiet against my face and across the square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow
i had caught a cold and do as i would i could not avoid an occasional sneeze
and every dog that came in sight with its pointing nose and curious sniffing was a terror to me
then came men and boys running first one and then others and shouting as they ran
it was a fire
they ran in the direction of my lodging and looking back down a street i saw a mass of black smoke streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires
it was my lodging burning my clothes my apparatus all my resources indeed except my chequebook and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in great portland street were there
burning
i had burnt my boatsif ever a man did
the place was blazing
the invisible man paused and thought
kemp glanced nervously out of the window
yes
he said
go on
chapter xxii  in the emporium   so last january with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about meand if it settled on me it would betray meweary cold painful inexpressibly wretched and still but half convinced of my invisible quality i began this new life to which i am committed
i had no refuge no appliances no human being in the world in whom i could confide
to have told my secret would have given me awaymade a mere show and rarity of me
nevertheless i was halfminded to accost some passerby and throw myself upon his mercy
but i knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke
i made no plans in the street
my sole object was to get shelter from the snow to get myself covered and warm then i might hope to plan
but even to me an invisible man the rows of london houses stood latched barred and bolted impregnably
only one thing could i see clearly before methe cold exposure and misery of the snowstorm and the night
and then i had a brilliant idea
i turned down one of the roads leading from gower street to tottenham court road and found myself outside omniums the big establishment where everything is to be boughtyou know the place meat grocery linen furniture clothing oil paintings evena huge meandering collection of shops rather than a shop
i had thought i should find the doors open but they were closed and as i stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside and a man in uniformyou know the kind of personage with 'omnium' on his capflung open the door
i contrived to enter and walking down the shopit was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of thingcame to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and wicker furniture
i did not feel safe there however people were going to and fro and i prowled restlessly about until i came upon a huge section in an upper floor containing multitudes of bedsteads and over these i clambered and found a restingplace at last among a huge pile of folded flock mattresses
the place was already lit up and agreeably warm and i decided to remain where i was keeping a cautious eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the place until closing time came
then i should be able i thought to rob the place for food and clothing and disguised prowl through it and examine its resources perhaps sleep on some of the bedding
that seemed an acceptable plan
my idea was to procure clothing to make myself a muffled but acceptable figure to get money and then to recover my books and parcels where they awaited me take a lodging somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the advantages my invisibility gave me as i still imagined over my fellowmen
closing time arrived quickly enough
it could not have been more than an hour after i took up my position on the mattresses before i noticed the blinds of the windows being drawn and customers being marched doorward
and then a number of brisk young men began with remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed
i left my lair as the crowds diminished and prowled cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop
i was really surprised to observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for sale during the day
all the boxes of goods the hanging fabrics the festoons of lace the boxes of sweets in the grocery section the displays of this and that were being whipped down folded up slapped into tidy receptacles and everything that could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them
finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters leaving the floor clear
directly each of these young people had done he or she made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as i have rarely observed in a shop assistant before
then came a lot of youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms
i had to dodge to get out of the way and as it was my ankle got stung with the sawdust
for some time wandering through the swathed and darkened departments i could hear the brooms at work
and at last a good hour or more after the shop had been closed came a noise of locking doors
silence came upon the place and i found myself wandering through the vast and intricate shops galleries showrooms of the place alone
it was very still in one place i remember passing near one of the tottenham court road entrances and listening to the tapping of bootheels of the passersby
my first visit was to the place where i had seen stockings and gloves for sale
it was dark and i had the devil of a hunt after matches which i found at last in the drawer of the little cash desk
then i had to get a candle
i had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of boxes and drawers but at last i managed to turn out what i sought the box label called them lambswool pants and lambswool vests
then socks a thick comforter and then i went to the clothing place and got trousers a lounge jacket an overcoat and a slouch hata clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down
i began to feel a human being again and my next thought was food
upstairs was a refreshment department and there i got cold meat
there was coffee still in the urn and i lit the gas and warmed it up again and altogether i did not do badly
afterwards prowling through the place in search of blanketsi had to put up at last with a heap of down quiltsi came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits more than was good for me indeedand some white burgundy
and near that was a toy department and i had a brilliant idea
i found some artificial nosesdummy noses you know and i thought of dark spectacles
but omniums had no optical department
my nose had been a difficulty indeedi had thought of paint
but the discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like
finally i went to sleep in a heap of down quilts very warm and comfortable
my last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable i had had since the change
i was in a state of physical serenity and that was reflected in my mind
i thought that i should be able to slip out unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me muffling my face with a white wrapper i had taken purchase with the money i had taken spectacles and so forth and so complete my disguise
i lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during the last few days
i saw the ugly little jew of a landlord vociferating in his rooms i saw his two sons marvelling and the wrinkled old woman's gnarled face as she asked for her cat
i experienced again the strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear and so i came round to the windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling 'earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust' at my father's open grave
'you also' said a voice and suddenly i was being forced towards the grave
i struggled shouted appealed to the mourners but they continued stonily following the service the old clergyman too never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual
i realised i was invisible and inaudible that overwhelming forces had their grip on me
i struggled in vain i was forced over the brink the coffin rang hollow as i fell upon it and the gravel came flying after me in spadefuls
nobody heeded me nobody was aware of me
i made convulsive struggles and awoke
the pale london dawn had come the place was full of a chilly grey light that filtered round the edges of the window blinds
i sat up and for a time i could not think where this ample apartment with its counters its piles of rolled stuff its heap of quilts and cushions its iron pillars might be
then as recollection came back to me i heard voices in conversation
then far down the place in the brighter light of some department which had already raised its blinds i saw two men approaching
i scrambled to my feet looking about me for some way of escape and even as i did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me
i suppose they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away
'who's that'
cried one and 'stop there'
shouted the other
i dashed around a corner and came full tilta faceless figure mind youon a lanky lad of fifteen
he yelled and i bowled him over rushed past him turned another corner and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter
in another moment feet went running past and i heard voices shouting 'all hands to the doors'
asking what was 'up' and giving one another advice how to catch me
lying on the ground i felt scared out of my wits
butodd as it may seemit did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as i should have done
i had made up my mind i suppose to get away in them and that ruled me
and then down the vista of the counters came a bawling of 'here he is'
i sprang to my feet whipped a chair off the counter and sent it whirling at the fool who had shouted turned came into another round a corner sent him spinning and rushed up the stairs
he kept his footing gave a view hallo and came up the staircase hot after me
up the staircase were piled a multitude of those brightcoloured pot thingswhat are they
art pots suggested kemp
that's it
art pots
well i turned at the top step and swung round plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came at me
the whole pile of pots went headlong and i heard shouting and footsteps running from all parts
i made a mad rush for the refreshment place and there was a man in white like a man cook who took up the chase
i made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery
i went behind the counter of this and waited for my cook and as he bolted in at the head of the chase i doubled him up with a lamp
down he went and i crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as i could
coat jacket trousers shoes were all right but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin
i heard more men coming my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter stunned or scared speechless and i had to make another dash for it like a rabbit hunted out of a woodpile
'this way policeman'
i heard someone shouting
i found myself in my bedstead storeroom again and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes
i rushed among them went flat got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling and stood a free man again panting and scared as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner
they made a rush for the vest and pants and collared the trousers
'he's dropping his plunder' said one of the young men
'he must be somewhere here'
but they did not find me all the same
i stood watching them hunt for me for a time and cursing my illluck in losing the clothes
then i went into the refreshmentroom drank a little milk i found there and sat down by the fire to consider my position
in a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over the business very excitedly and like the fools they were
i heard a magnified account of my depredations and other speculations as to my whereabouts
then i fell to scheming again
the insurmountable difficulty of the place especially now it was alarmed was to get any plunder out of it
i went down into the warehouse to see if there was any chance of packing and addressing a parcel but i could not understand the system of checking
about eleven o'clock the snow having thawed as it fell and the day being finer and a little warmer than the previous one i decided that the emporium was hopeless and went out again exasperated at my want of success with only the vaguest plans of action in my mind
chapter xxiii  in drury lane   but you begin now to realise said the invisible man the full disadvantage of my condition
i had no shelterno coveringto get clothing was to forego all my advantage to make myself a strange and terrible thing
i was fasting for to eat to fill myself with unassimilated matter would be to become grotesquely visible again
i never thought of that said kemp
nor had i
and the snow had warned me of other dangers
i could not go abroad in snowit would settle on me and expose me
rain too would make me a watery outline a glistening surface of a mana bubble
and fogi should be like a fainter bubble in a fog a surface a greasy glimmer of humanity
moreover as i went abroadin the london airi gathered dirt about my ankles floating smuts and dust upon my skin
i did not know how long it would be before i should become visible from that cause also
but i saw clearly it could not be for long
not in london at any rate
i went into the slums towards great portland street and found myself at the end of the street in which i had lodged
i did not go that way because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking ruins of the house i had fired
my most immediate problem was to get clothing
what to do with my face puzzled me
then i saw in one of those little miscellaneous shopsnews sweets toys stationery belated christmas tomfoolery and so forthan array of masks and noses
i realised that problem was solved
in a flash i saw my course
i turned about no longer aimless and wentcircuitously in order to avoid the busy ways towards the back streets north of the strand for i remembered though not very distinctly where that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district
the day was cold with a nipping wind down the northward running streets
i walked fast to avoid being overtaken
every crossing was a danger every passenger a thing to watch alertly
one man as i was about to pass him at the top of bedford street turned upon me abruptly and came into me sending me into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom
the verdict of the cabrank was that he had had some sort of stroke
i was so unnerved by this encounter that i went into covent garden market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets panting and trembling
i found i had caught a fresh cold and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention
at last i reached the object of my quest a dirty flyblown little shop in a byway near drury lane with a window full of tinsel robes sham jewels wigs slippers dominoes and theatrical photographs
the shop was oldfashioned and low and dark and the house rose above it for four storeys dark and dismal
i peered through the window and seeing no one within entered
the opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing
i left it open and walked round a bare costume stand into a corner behind a cheval glass
for a minute or so no one came
then i heard heavy feet striding across a room and a man appeared down the shop
my plans were now perfectly definite
i proposed to make my way into the house secrete myself upstairs watch my opportunity and when everything was quiet rummage out a wig mask spectacles and costume and go into the world perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure
and incidentally of course i could rob the house of any available money
the man who had just entered the shop was a short slight hunched beetlebrowed man with long arms and very short bandy legs
apparently i had interrupted a meal
he stared about the shop with an expression of expectation
this gave way to surprise and then to anger as he saw the shop empty
'damn the boys'
he said
he went to stare up and down the street
he came in again in a minute kicked the door to with his foot spitefully and went muttering back to the house door
i came forward to follow him and at the noise of my movement he stopped dead
i did so too startled by his quickness of ear
he slammed the house door in my face
i stood hesitating
suddenly i heard his quick footsteps returning and the door reopened
he stood looking about the shop like one who was still not satisfied
then murmuring to himself he examined the back of the counter and peered behind some fixtures
then he stood doubtful
he had left the house door open and i slipped into the inner room
it was a queer little room poorly furnished and with a number of big masks in the corner
on the table was his belated breakfast and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me kemp to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal
and his table manners were irritating
three doors opened into the little room one going upstairs and one down but they were all shut
i could not get out of the room while he was there i could scarcely move because of his alertness and there was a draught down my back
twice i strangled a sneeze just in time
the spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel but for all that i was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his eating
but at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot and gathering all the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth he took the whole lot of things after him
his burden prevented his shutting the door behind himas he would have done i never saw such a man for shutting doorsand i followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and scullery
i had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up and then finding no good in keeping down there and the brick floor being cold on my feet i returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire
it was burning low and scarcely thinking i put on a little coal
the noise of this brought him up at once and he stood aglare
he peered about the room and was within an ace of touching me
even after that examination he scarcely seemed satisfied
he stopped in the doorway and took a final inspection before he went down
i waited in the little parlour for an age and at last he came up and opened the upstairs door
i just managed to get by him
on the staircase he stopped suddenly so that i very nearly blundered into him
he stood looking back right into my face and listening
'i could have sworn' he said
his long hairy hand pulled at his lower lip
his eye went up and down the staircase
then he grunted and went on up again
his hand was on the handle of a door and then he stopped again with the same puzzled anger on his face
he was becoming aware of the faint sounds of my movements about him
the man must have had diabolically acute hearing
he suddenly flashed into rage
'if there's anyone in this house' he cried with an oath and left the threat unfinished
he put his hand in his pocket failed to find what he wanted and rushing past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs
but i did not follow him
i sat on the head of the staircase until his return
presently he came up again still muttering
he opened the door of the room and before i could enter slammed it in my face
i resolved to explore the house and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible
the house was very old and tumbledown damp so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls and rat infested
some of the door handles were stiff and i was afraid to turn them
several rooms i did inspect were unfurnished and others were littered with theatrical lumber bought secondhand i judged from its appearance
in one room next to his i found a lot of old clothes
i began routing among these and in my eagerness forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears
i heard a stealthy footstep and looking up just in time saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an oldfashioned revolver in his hand
i stood perfectly still while he stared about openmouthed and suspicious
'it must have been her' he said slowly
'damn her'
he shut the door quietly and immediately i heard the key turn in the lock
then his footsteps retreated
i realised abruptly that i was locked in
for a minute i did not know what to do
i walked from door to window and back and stood perplexed
a gust of anger came upon me
but i decided to inspect the clothes before i did anything further and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf
this brought him back more sinister than ever
that time he actually touched me jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room
presently he calmed a little
'rats' he said in an undertone fingers on lips
he was evidently a little scared
i edged quietly out of the room but a plank creaked
then the infernal little brute started going all over the house revolver in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys
when i realised what he was up to i had a fit of ragei could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity
by this time i knew he was alone in the house and so i made no more ado but knocked him on the head
knocked him on the head
exclaimed kemp
yesstunned himas he was going downstairs
hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing
he went downstairs like a bag of old boots
buti say
the common conventions of humanity  are all very well for common people
but the point was kemp that i had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me
i couldn't think of any other way of doing it
and then i gagged him with a louis quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet
tied him up in a sheet
made a sort of bag of it
it was rather a good idea to keep the idiot scared and quiet and a devilish hard thing to get out ofhead away from the string
my dear kemp it's no good your sitting glaring as though i was a murderer
it had to be done
he had his revolver
if once he saw me he would be able to describe me  but still said kemp in englandtoday
and the man was in his own house and you werewell robbing
robbing
confound it
you'll call me a thief next
surely kemp you're not fool enough to dance on the old strings
can't you see my position
and his too said kemp
the invisible man stood up sharply
what do you mean to say
kemp's face grew a trifle hard
he was about to speak and checked himself
i suppose after all he said with a sudden change of manner the thing had to be done
you were in a fix
but still  of course i was in a fixan infernal fix
and he made me wild toohunting me about the house fooling about with his revolver locking and unlocking doors
he was simply exasperating
you don't blame me do you
you don't blame me
i never blame anyone said kemp
it's quite out of fashion
what did you do next
i was hungry
downstairs i found a loaf and some rank cheesemore than sufficient to satisfy my hunger
i took some brandy and water and then went up past my impromptu baghe was lying quite stillto the room containing the old clothes
this looked out upon the street two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the window
i went and peered out through their interstices
outside the day was brightby contrast with the brown shadows of the dismal house in which i found myself dazzlingly bright
a brisk traffic was going by fruit carts a hansom a fourwheeler with a pile of boxes a fishmonger's cart
i turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me
my excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my position again
the room was full of a faint scent of benzoline used i suppose in cleaning the garments
i began a systematic search of the place
i should judge the hunchback had been alone in the house for some time
he was a curious person
everything that could possibly be of service to me i collected in the clothes storeroom and then i made a deliberate selection
i found a handbag i thought a suitable possession and some powder rouge and stickingplaster
i had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was to show of me in order to render myself visible but the disadvantage of this lay in the fact that i should require turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time before i could vanish again
finally i chose a mask of the better type slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings dark glasses greyish whiskers and a wig
i could find no underclothing but that i could buy subsequently and for the time i swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs
i could find no socks but the hunchback's boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed
in a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings' worth of silver and in a locked cupboard i burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold
i could go forth into the world again equipped
then came a curious hesitation
was my appearance really credible
i tried myself with a little bedroom lookingglass inspecting myself from every point of view to discover any forgotten chink but it all seemed sound
i was grotesque to the theatrical pitch a stage miser but i was certainly not a physical impossibility
gathering confidence i took my lookingglass down into the shop pulled down the shop blinds and surveyed myself from every point of view with the help of the cheval glass in the corner
i spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop door and marched out into the street leaving the little man to get out of his sheet again when he liked
in five minutes a dozen turnings intervened between me and the costumier's shop
no one appeared to notice me very pointedly
my last difficulty seemed overcome
he stopped again
and you troubled no more about the hunchback
said kemp
no said the invisible man
nor have i heard what became of him
i suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out
the knots were pretty tight
he became silent and went to the window and stared out
what happened when you went out into the strand
ohdisillusionment again
i thought my troubles were over
practically i thought i had impunity to do whatever i chose everythingsave to give away my secret
so i thought
whatever i did whatever the consequences might be was nothing to me
i had merely to fling aside my garments and vanish
no person could hold me
i could take my money where i found it
i decided to treat myself to a sumptuous feast and then put up at a good hotel and accumulate a new outfit of property
i felt amazingly confident it's not particularly pleasant recalling that i was an ass
i went into a place and was already ordering lunch when it occurred to me that i could not eat unless i exposed my invisible face
i finished ordering the lunch told the man i should be back in ten minutes and went out exasperated
i don't know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite
not quite so badly said kemp but i can imagine it
i could have smashed the silly devils
at last faint with the desire for tasteful food i went into another place and demanded a private room
'i am disfigured' i said
'badly'
they looked at me curiously but of course it was not their affairand so at last i got my lunch
it was not particularly well served but it sufficed and when i had had it i sat over a cigar trying to plan my line of action
and outside a snowstorm was beginning
the more i thought it over kemp the more i realised what a helpless absurdity an invisible man wasin a cold and dirty climate and a crowded civilised city
before i made this mad experiment i had dreamt of a thousand advantages
that afternoon it seemed all disappointment
i went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable
no doubt invisibility made it possible to get them but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got
ambitionwhat is the good of pride of place when you cannot appear there
what is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be delilah
i have no taste for politics for the blackguardisms of fame for philanthropy for sport
what was i to do
and for this i had become a wrappedup mystery a swathed and bandaged caricature of a man
he paused and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the window
but how did you get to iping
said kemp anxious to keep his guest busy talking
i went there to work
i had one hope
it was a half idea
i have it still
it is a full blown idea now
a way of getting back
of restoring what i have done
when i choose
when i have done all i mean to do invisibly
and that is what i chiefly want to talk to you about now
you went straight to iping
yes
i had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my chequebook my luggage and underclothing order a quantity of chemicals to work out this idea of minei will show you the calculations as soon as i get my booksand then i started
jove
i remember the snowstorm now and the accursed bother it was to keep the snow from damping my pasteboard nose
at the end said kemp the day before yesterday when they found you out you ratherto judge by the papers  i did
rather
did i kill that fool of a constable
no said kemp
he's expected to recover
that's his luck then
i clean lost my temper the fools
why couldn't they leave me alone
and that grocer lout
there are no deaths expected said kemp
i don't know about that tramp of mine said the invisible man with an unpleasant laugh
by heaven kemp you don't know what rage is
 to have worked for years to have planned and plotted and then to get some fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course
 every conceivable sort of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me
if i have much more of it i shall go wildi shall start mowing 'em
as it is they've made things a thousand times more difficult
no doubt it's exasperating said kemp drily
chapter xxiv  the plan that failed   but now said kemp with a side glance out of the window what are we to do
he moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing up the hill roadwith an intolerable slowness as it seemed to kemp
what were you planning to do when you were heading for port burdock
had you any plan
i was going to clear out of the country
but i have altered that plan rather since seeing you
i thought it would be wise now the weather is hot and invisibility possible to make for the south
especially as my secret was known and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and muffled man
you have a line of steamers from here to france
my idea was to get aboard one and run the risks of the passage
thence i could go by train into spain or else get to algiers
it would not be difficult
there a man might always be invisibleand yet live
and do things
i was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier until i decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me
that's clear
and then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me
he has hidden my books kemp
hidden my books
if i can lay my hands on him
best plan to get the books out of him first
but where is he
do you know
he's in the town police station locked up by his own request in the strongest cell in the place
cur
said the invisible man
but that hangs up your plans a little
we must get those books those books are vital
certainly said kemp a little nervously wondering if he heard footsteps outside
certainly we must get those books
but that won't be difficult if he doesn't know they're for you
no said the invisible man and thought
kemp tried to think of something to keep the talk going but the invisible man resumed of his own accord
blundering into your house kemp he said changes all my plans
for you are a man that can understand
in spite of all that has happened in spite of this publicity of the loss of my books of what i have suffered there still remain great possibilities huge possibilities  you have told no one i am here
he asked abruptly
kemp hesitated
that was implied he said
no one
insisted griffin
not a soul
ah
now the invisible man stood up and sticking his arms akimbo began to pace the study
i made a mistake kemp a huge mistake in carrying this thing through alone
i have wasted strength time opportunities
aloneit is wonderful how little a man can do alone
to rob a little to hurt a little and there is the end
what i want kemp is a goalkeeper a helper and a hidingplace an arrangement whereby i can sleep and eat and rest in peace and unsuspected
i must have a confederate
with a confederate with food and resta thousand things are possible
hitherto i have gone on vague lines
we have to consider all that invisibility means all that it does not mean
it means little advantage for eavesdropping and so forthone makes sounds
it's of little helpa little help perhapsin housebreaking and so forth
once you've caught me you could easily imprison me
but on the other hand i am hard to catch
this invisibility in fact is only good in two cases it's useful in getting away it's useful in approaching
it's particularly useful therefore in killing
i can walk round a man whatever weapon he has choose my point strike as i like
dodge as i like
escape as i like
kemp's hand went to his moustache
was that a movement downstairs
and it is killing we must do kemp
it is killing we must do repeated kemp
i'm listening to your plan griffin but i'm not agreeing mind
why killing
not wanton killing but a judicious slaying
the point is they know there is an invisible manas well as we know there is an invisible man
and that invisible man kemp must now establish a reign of terror
yes no doubt it's startling
but i mean it
a reign of terror
he must take some town like your burdock and terrify and dominate it
he must issue his orders
he can do that in a thousand waysscraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice
and all who disobey his orders he must kill and kill all who would defend them
humph
said kemp no longer listening to griffin but to the sound of his front door opening and closing
it seems to me griffin he said to cover his wandering attention that your confederate would be in a difficult position
no one would know he was a confederate said the invisible man eagerly
and then suddenly hush
what's that downstairs
nothing said kemp and suddenly began to speak loud and fast
i don't agree to this griffin he said
understand me i don't agree to this
why dream of playing a game against the race
how can you hope to gain happiness
don't be a lone wolf
publish your results take the worldtake the nation at leastinto your confidence
think what you might do with a million helpers  the invisible man interruptedarm extended
there are footsteps coming upstairs he said in a low voice
nonsense said kemp
let me see said the invisible man and advanced arm extended to the door
and then things happened very swiftly
kemp hesitated for a second and then moved to intercept him
the invisible man started and stood still
traitor
cried the voice and suddenly the dressinggown opened and sitting down the unseen began to disrobe
kemp made three swift steps to the door and forthwith the invisible manhis legs had vanishedsprang to his feet with a shout
kemp flung the door open
as it opened there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and voices
with a quick movement kemp thrust the invisible man back sprang aside and slammed the door
the key was outside and ready
in another moment griffin would have been alone in the belvedere study a prisoner
save for one little thing
the key had been slipped in hastily that morning
as kemp slammed the door it fell noisily upon the carpet
kemp's face became white
he tried to grip the door handle with both hands
for a moment he stood lugging
then the door gave six inches
but he got it closed again
the second time it was jerked a foot wide and the dressinggown came wedging itself into the opening
his throat was gripped by invisible fingers and he left his hold on the handle to defend himself
he was forced back tripped and pitched heavily into the corner of the landing
the empty dressinggown was flung on the top of him
halfway up the staircase was colonel adye the recipient of kemp's letter the chief of the burdock police
he was staring aghast at the sudden appearance of kemp followed by the extraordinary sight of clothing tossing empty in the air
he saw kemp felled and struggling to his feet
he saw him rush forward and go down again felled like an ox
then suddenly he was struck violently
by nothing
a vast weight it seemed leapt upon him and he was hurled headlong down the staircase with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin
an invisible foot trod on his back a ghostly patter passed downstairs he heard the two police officers in the hall shout and run and the front door of the house slammed violently
he rolled over and sat up staring
he saw staggering down the staircase kemp dusty and disheveled one side of his face white from a blow his lip bleeding and a pink dressinggown and some underclothing held in his arms
my god
cried kemp the game's up
he's gone
chapter xxv  the hunting of the invisible man   for a space kemp was too inarticulate to make adye understand the swift things that had just happened
they stood on the landing kemp speaking swiftly the grotesque swathings of griffin still on his arm
but presently adye began to grasp something of the situation
he is mad said kemp inhuman
he is pure selfishness
he thinks of nothing but his own advantage his own safety
i have listened to such a story this morning of brutal selfseeking
he has wounded men
he will kill them unless we can prevent him
he will create a panic
nothing can stop him
he is going out nowfurious
he must be caught said adye
that is certain
but how
cried kemp and suddenly became full of ideas
you must begin at once
you must set every available man to work you must prevent his leaving this district
once he gets away he may go through the countryside as he wills killing and maiming
he dreams of a reign of terror
a reign of terror i tell you
you must set a watch on trains and roads and shipping
the garrison must help
you must wire for help
the only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value
i will tell you of that
there is a man in your police stationmarvel
i know said adye i know
those booksyes
but the tramp  says he hasn't them
but he thinks the tramp has
and you must prevent him from eating or sleeping day and night the country must be astir for him
food must be locked up and secured all food so that he will have to break his way to it
the houses everywhere must be barred against him
heaven send us cold nights and rain
the whole countryside must begin hunting and keep hunting
i tell you adye he is a danger a disaster unless he is pinned and secured it is frightful to think of the things that may happen
what else can we do
said adye
i must go down at once and begin organising
but why not come
yesyou come too
come and we must hold a sort of council of warget hopps to helpand the railway managers
by jove
it's urgent
come alongtell me as we go
what else is there we can do
put that stuff down
in another moment adye was leading the way downstairs
they found the front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty air
he's got away sir said one
we must go to the central station at once said adye
one of you go on down and get a cab to come up and meet usquickly
and now kemp what else
dogs said kemp
get dogs
they don't see him but they wind him
get dogs
good said adye
it's not generally known but the prison officials over at halstead know a man with bloodhounds
dogs
what else
bear in mind said kemp his food shows
after eating his food shows until it is assimilated
so that he has to hide after eating
you must keep on beating
every thicket every quiet corner
and put all weaponsall implements that might be weapons away
he can't carry such things for long
and what he can snatch up and strike men with must be hidden away
good again said adye
we shall have him yet
and on the roads said kemp and hesitated
yes
said adye
powdered glass said kemp
it's cruel i know
but think of what he may do
adye drew the air in sharply between his teeth
it's unsportsmanlike
i don't know
but i'll have powdered glass got ready
if he goes too far  the man's become inhuman i tell you said kemp
i am as sure he will establish a reign of terrorso soon as he has got over the emotions of this escapeas i am sure i am talking to you
our only chance is to be ahead
he has cut himself off from his kind
his blood be upon his own head
chapter xxvi  the wicksteed murder   the invisible man seems to have rushed out of kemp's house in a state of blind fury
a little child playing near kemp's gateway was violently caught up and thrown aside so that its ankle was broken and thereafter for some hours the invisible man passed out of human perceptions
no one knows where he went nor what he did
but one can imagine him hurrying through the hot june forenoon up the hill and on to the open downland behind port burdock raging and despairing at his intolerable fate and sheltering at last heated and weary amid the thickets of hintondean to piece together again his shattered schemes against his species
that seems the most probable refuge for him for there it was he reasserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon
one wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time and what plans he devised
no doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated by kemp's treachery and though we may be able to understand the motives that led to that deceit we may still imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have occasioned
perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his oxford street experiences may have returned to him for he had evidently counted on kemp's cooperation in his brutal dream of a terrorised world
at any rate he vanished from human ken about midday and no living witness can tell what he did until about halfpast two
it was a fortunate thing perhaps for humanity but for him it was a fatal inaction
during that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the countryside were busy
in the morning he had still been simply a legend a terror in the afternoon by virtue chiefly of kemp's drily worded proclamation he was presented as a tangible antagonist to be wounded captured or overcome and the countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity
by two o'clock even he might still have removed himself out of the district by getting aboard a train but after two that became impossible
every passenger train along the lines on a great parallelogram between southampton manchester brighton and horsham travelled with locked doors and the goods traffic was almost entirely suspended
and in a great circle of twenty miles round port burdock men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out in groups of three and four with dogs to beat the roads and fields
mounted policemen rode along the country lanes stopping at every cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses and keep indoors unless they were armed and all the elementary schools had broken up by three o'clock and the children scared and keeping together in groups were hurrying home
kemp's proclamationsigned indeed by adyewas posted over almost the whole district by four or five o'clock in the afternoon
it gave briefly but clearly all the conditions of the struggle the necessity of keeping the invisible man from food and sleep the necessity for incessant watchfulness and for a prompt attention to any evidence of his movements
and so swift and decided was the action of the authorities so prompt and universal was the belief in this strange being that before nightfall an area of several hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege
and before nightfall too a thrill of horror went through the whole watching nervous countryside
going from whispering mouth to mouth swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country passed the story of the murder of mr wicksteed
if our supposition that the invisible man's refuge was the hintondean thickets then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon
we cannot know what the project was but the evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he met wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming
of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter
it occurred on the edge of a gravel pit not two hundred yards from lord burdock's lodge gate
everything points to a desperate strugglethe trampled ground the numerous wounds mr wicksteed received his splintered walkingstick but why the attack was made save in a murderous frenzy it is impossible to imagine
indeed the theory of madness is almost unavoidable
mr wicksteed was a man of fortyfive or fortysix steward to lord burdock of inoffensive habits and appearance the very last person in the world to provoke such a terrible antagonist
against him it would seem the invisible man used an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence
he stopped this quiet man going quietly home to his midday meal attacked him beat down his feeble defences broke his arm felled him and smashed his head to a jelly
of course he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he met his victimhe must have been carrying it ready in his hand
only two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the matter
one is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in mr wicksteed's direct path home but nearly a couple of hundred yards out of his way
the other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect that going to her afternoon school she saw the murdered man trotting in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit
her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his walkingstick
she was the last person to see him alive
he passed out of her sight to his death the struggle being hidden from her only by a clump of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground
now this to the present writer's mind at least lifts the murder out of the realm of the absolutely wanton
we may imagine that griffin had taken the rod as a weapon indeed but without any deliberate intention of using it in murder
wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this rod inexplicably moving through the air
without any thought of the invisible manfor port burdock is ten miles awayhe may have pursued it
it is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of the invisible man
one can then imagine the invisible man making offquietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the neighbourhood and wicksteed excited and curious pursuing this unaccountably locomotive objectfinally striking at it
no doubt the invisible man could easily have distanced his middleaged pursuer under ordinary circumstances but the position in which wicksteed's body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the gravel pit
to those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of the invisible man the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine
but this is pure hypothesis
the only undeniable factsfor stories of children are often unreliableare the discovery of wicksteed's body done to death and of the bloodstained iron rod flung among the nettles
the abandonment of the rod by griffin suggests that in the emotional excitement of the affair the purpose for which he took itif he had a purposewas abandoned
he was certainly an intensely egotistical and unfeeling man but the sight of his victim his first victim bloody and pitiful at his feet may have released some long pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever scheme of action he had contrived
after the murder of mr wicksteed he would seem to have struck across the country towards the downland
there is a story of a voice heard about sunset by a couple of men in a field near fern bottom
it was wailing and laughing sobbing and groaning and ever and again it shouted
it must have been queer hearing
it drove up across the middle of a clover field and died away towards the hills
that afternoon the invisible man must have learnt something of the rapid use kemp had made of his confidences
he must have found houses locked and secured he may have loitered about railway stations and prowled about inns and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised something of the nature of the campaign against him
and as the evening advanced the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three or four men and noisy with the yelping of dogs
these menhunters had particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one another
but he avoided them all
we may understand something of his exasperation and it could have been none the less because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so remorselessly against him
for that day at least he lost heart for nearly twentyfour hours save when he turned on wicksteed he was a hunted man
in the night he must have eaten and slept for in the morning he was himself again active powerful angry and malignant prepared for his last great struggle against the world
chapter xxvii  the siege of kemp's house   kemp read a strange missive written in pencil on a greasy sheet of paper
you have been amazingly energetic and clever this letter ran though what you stand to gain by it i cannot imagine
you are against me
for a whole day you have chased me you have tried to rob me of a night's rest
but i have had food in spite of you i have slept in spite of you and the game is only beginning
the game is only beginning
there is nothing for it but to start the terror
this announces the first day of the terror
port burdock is no longer under the queen tell your colonel of police and the rest of them it is under methe terror
this is day one of year one of the new epochthe epoch of the invisible man
i am invisible man the first
to begin with the rule will be easy
the first day there will be one execution for the sake of examplea man named kemp
death starts for him today
he may lock himself away hide himself away get guards about him put on armour if he likesdeath the unseen death is coming
let him take precautions it will impress my people
death starts from the pillar box by midday
the letter will fall in as the postman comes along then off
the game begins
death starts
help him not my people lest death fall upon you also
today kemp is to die
kemp read this letter twice it's no hoax he said
that's his voice
and he means it
he turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the postmark hintondean and the prosaic detail d
to pay
he got up slowly leaving his lunch unfinishedthe letter had come by the one o'clock postand went into his study
he rang for his housekeeper and told her to go round the house at once examine all the fastenings of the windows and close all the shutters
he closed the shutters of his study himself
from a locked drawer in his bedroom he took a little revolver examined it carefully and put it into the pocket of his lounge jacket
he wrote a number of brief notes one to colonel adye gave them to his servant to take with explicit instructions as to her way of leaving the house
there is no danger he said and added a mental reservation to you
he remained meditative for a space after doing this and then returned to his cooling lunch
he ate with gaps of thought
finally he struck the table sharply
we will have him
he said and i am the bait
he will come too far
he went up to the belvedere carefully shutting every door after him
it's a game he said an odd gamebut the chances are all for me mr griffin in spite of your invisibility
griffin contra mundum  with a vengeance
he stood at the window staring at the hot hillside
he must get food every dayand i don't envy him
did he really sleep last night
out in the open somewheresecure from collisions
i wish we could get some good cold wet weather instead of the heat
he may be watching me now
he went close to the window
something rapped smartly against the brickwork over the frame and made him start violently back
i'm getting nervous said kemp
but it was five minutes before he went to the window again
it must have been a sparrow he said
presently he heard the frontdoor bell ringing and hurried downstairs
he unbolted and unlocked the door examined the chain put it up and opened cautiously without showing himself
a familiar voice hailed him
it was adye
your servant's been assaulted kemp he said round the door
what
exclaimed kemp
had that note of yours taken away from her
he's close about here
let me in
kemp released the chain and adye entered through as narrow an opening as possible
he stood in the hall looking with infinite relief at kemp refastening the door
note was snatched out of her hand
scared her horribly
she's down at the station
hysterics
he's close here
what was it about
kemp swore
what a fool i was said kemp
i might have known
it's not an hour's walk from hintondean
already
what's up
said adye
look here
said kemp and led the way into his study
he handed adye the invisible man's letter
adye read it and whistled softly
and you
said adye
proposed a traplike a fool said kemp and sent my proposal out by a maid servant
to him
adye followed kemp's profanity
he'll clear out said adye
not he said kemp
a resounding smash of glass came from upstairs
adye had a silvery glimpse of a little revolver half out of kemp's pocket
it's a window upstairs
said kemp and led the way up
there came a second smash while they were still on the staircase
when they reached the study they found two of the three windows smashed half the room littered with splintered glass and one big flint lying on the writing table
the two men stopped in the doorway contemplating the wreckage
kemp swore again and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol hung starred for a moment and collapsed in jagged shivering triangles into the room
what's this for
said adye
it's a beginning said kemp
there's no way of climbing up here
not for a cat said kemp
no shutters
not here
all the downstairs roomshullo
smash and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs
confound him
said kemp
that must beyesit's one of the bedrooms
he's going to do all the house
but he's a fool
the shutters are up and the glass will fall outside
he'll cut his feet
another window proclaimed its destruction
the two men stood on the landing perplexed
i have it
said adye
let me have a stick or something and i'll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put on
that ought to settle him
they're hard bynot ten minutes  another window went the way of its fellows
you haven't a revolver
asked adye
kemp's hand went to his pocket
then he hesitated
i haven't oneat least to spare
i'll bring it back said adye you'll be safe here
kemp ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness handed him the weapon
now for the door said adye
as they stood hesitating in the hall they heard one of the firstfloor bedroom windows crack and clash
kemp went to the door and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible
his face was a little paler than usual
you must step straight out said kemp
in another moment adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples
he hesitated for a moment feeling more comfortable with his back against the door
then he marched upright and square down the steps
he crossed the lawn and approached the gate
a little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass
something moved near him
stop a bit said a voice and adye stopped dead and his hand tightened on the revolver
well
said adye white and grim and every nerve tense
oblige me by going back to the house said the voice as tense and grim as adye's
sorry said adye a little hoarsely and moistened his lips with his tongue
the voice was on his left front he thought
suppose he were to take his luck with a shot
what are you going for
said the voice and there was a quick movement of the two and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of adye's pocket
adye desisted and thought
where i go he said slowly is my own business
the words were still on his lips when an arm came round his neck his back felt a knee and he was sprawling backward
he drew clumsily and fired absurdly and in another moment he was struck in the mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip
he made a vain clutch at a slippery limb tried to struggle up and fell back
damn
said adye
the voice laughed
i'd kill you now if it wasn't the waste of a bullet it said
he saw the revolver in midair six feet off covering him
well
said adye sitting up
get up said the voice
adye stood up
attention said the voice and then fiercely don't try any games
remember i can see your face if you can't see mine
you've got to go back to the house
he won't let me in said adye
that's a pity said the invisible man
i've got no quarrel with you
adye moistened his lips again
he glanced away from the barrel of the revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the midday sun the smooth green down the white cliff of the head and the multitudinous town and suddenly he knew that life was very sweet
his eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging between heaven and earth six yards away
what am i to do
he said sullenly
what am i to do
asked the invisible man
you will get help
the only thing is for you to go back
i will try
if he lets me in will you promise not to rush the door
i've got no quarrel with you said the voice
kemp had hurried upstairs after letting adye out and now crouching among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the study window sill he saw adye stand parleying with the unseen
why doesn't he fire
whispered kemp to himself
then the revolver moved a little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in kemp's eyes
he shaded his eyes and tried to see the source of the blinding beam
surely
he said adye has given up the revolver
promise not to rush the door adye was saying
don't push a winning game too far
give a man a chance
you go back to the house
i tell you flatly i will not promise anything
adye's decision seemed suddenly made
he turned towards the house walking slowly with his hands behind him
kemp watched himpuzzled
the revolver vanished flashed again into sight vanished again and became evident on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object following adye
then things happened very quickly
adye leapt backwards swung around clutched at this little object missed it threw up his hands and fell forward on his face leaving a little puff of blue in the air
kemp did not hear the sound of the shot
adye writhed raised himself on one arm fell forward and lay still
for a space kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of adye's attitude
the afternoon was very hot and still nothing seemed stirring in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate
adye lay on the lawn near the gate
the blinds of all the villas down the hillroad were drawn but in one little green summerhouse was a white figure apparently an old man asleep
kemp scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the revolver but it had vanished
his eyes came back to adye
the game was opening well
then came a ringing and knocking at the front door that grew at last tumultuous but pursuant to kemp's instructions the servants had locked themselves into their rooms
this was followed by a silence
kemp sat listening and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows one after another
he went to the staircase head and stood listening uneasily
he armed himself with his bedroom poker and went to examine the interior fastenings of the groundfloor windows again
everything was safe and quiet
he returned to the belvedere
adye lay motionless over the edge of the gravel just as he had fallen
coming along the road by the villas were the housemaid and two policemen
everything was deadly still
the three people seemed very slow in approaching
he wondered what his antagonist was doing
he started
there was a smash from below
he hesitated and went downstairs again
suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and the splintering of wood
he heard a smash and the destructive clang of the iron fastenings of the shutters
he turned the key and opened the kitchen door
as he did so the shutters split and splintering came flying inward
he stood aghast
the window frame save for one crossbar was still intact but only little teeth of glass remained in the frame
the shutters had been driven in with an axe and now the axe was descending in sweeping blows upon the window frame and the iron bars defending it
then suddenly it leapt aside and vanished
he saw the revolver lying on the path outside and then the little weapon sprang into the air
he dodged back
the revolver cracked just too late and a splinter from the edge of the closing door flashed over his head
he slammed and locked the door and as he stood outside he heard griffin shouting and laughing
then the blows of the axe with its splitting and smashing consequences were resumed
kemp stood in the passage trying to think
in a moment the invisible man would be in the kitchen
this door would not keep him a moment and then  a ringing came at the front door again
it would be the policemen
he ran into the hall put up the chain and drew the bolts
he made the girl speak before he dropped the chain and the three people blundered into the house in a heap and kemp slammed the door again
the invisible man
said kemp
he has a revolver with two shotsleft
he's killed adye
shot him anyhow
didn't you see him on the lawn
he's lying there
who
said one of the policemen
adye said kemp
we came in the back way said the girl
what's that smashing
asked one of the policemen
he's in the kitchenor will be
he has found an axe  suddenly the house was full of the invisible man's resounding blows on the kitchen door
the girl stared towards the kitchen shuddered and retreated into the diningroom
kemp tried to explain in broken sentences
they heard the kitchen door give
this way said kemp starting into activity and bundled the policemen into the diningroom doorway
poker said kemp and rushed to the fender
he handed the poker he had carried to the policeman and the diningroom one to the other
he suddenly flung himself backward
whup
said one policeman ducked and caught the axe on his poker
the pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable sidney cooper
the second policeman brought his poker down on the little weapon as one might knock down a wasp and sent it rattling to the floor
at the first clash the girl screamed stood screaming for a moment by the fireplace and then ran to open the shutterspossibly with an idea of escaping by the shattered window
the axe receded into the passage and fell to a position about two feet from the ground
they could hear the invisible man breathing
stand away you two he said
i want that man kemp
we want you said the first policeman making a quick step forward and wiping with his poker at the voice
the invisible man must have started back and he blundered into the umbrella stand
then as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had aimed the invisible man countered with the axe the helmet crumpled like paper and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head of the kitchen stairs
but the second policeman aiming behind the axe with his poker hit something soft that snapped
there was a sharp exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground
the policeman wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing he put his foot on the axe and struck again
then he stood poker clubbed listening intent for the slightest movement
he heard the diningroom window open and a quick rush of feet within
his companion rolled over and sat up with the blood running down between his eye and ear
where is he
asked the man on the floor
don't know
i've hit him
he's standing somewhere in the hall
unless he's slipped past you
doctor kempsir
pause
doctor kemp cried the policeman again
the second policeman began struggling to his feet
he stood up
suddenly the faint pad of bare feet on the kitchen stairs could be heard
yap
cried the first policeman and incontinently flung his poker
it smashed a little gas bracket
he made as if he would pursue the invisible man downstairs
then he thought better of it and stepped into the diningroom
doctor kemp he began and stopped short
doctor kemp's a hero he said as his companion looked over his shoulder
the diningroom window was wide open and neither housemaid nor kemp was to be seen
the second policeman's opinion of kemp was terse and vivid
chapter xxviii  the hunter hunted   mr heelas mr kemp's nearest neighbour among the villa holders was asleep in his summer house when the siege of kemp's house began
mr heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe in all this nonsense about an invisible man
his wife however as he was subsequently to be reminded did
he insisted upon walking about his garden just as if nothing was the matter and he went to sleep in the afternoon in accordance with the custom of years
he slept through the smashing of the windows and then woke up suddenly with a curious persuasion of something wrong
he looked across at kemp's house rubbed his eyes and looked again
then he put his feet to the ground and sat listening
he said he was damned but still the strange thing was visible
the house looked as though it had been deserted for weeksafter a violent riot
every window was broken and every window save those of the belvedere study was blinded by the internal shutters
i could have sworn it was all righthe looked at his watchtwenty minutes ago
he became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass far away in the distance
and then as he sat openmouthed came a still more wonderful thing
the shutters of the drawingroom window were flung open violently and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and garments appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash
suddenly a man appeared beside her helping herdr kemp
in another moment the window was open and the housemaid was struggling out she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs
mr heelas stood up exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things
he saw kemp stand on the sill spring from the window and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as he ran like a man who evades observation
he vanished behind a laburnum and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down
in a second he had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the slope towards mr heelas
lord
cried mr heelas struck with an idea it's that invisible man brute
it's right after all
with mr heelas to think things like that was to act and his cook watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting towards the house at a good nine miles an hour
there was a slamming of doors a ringing of bells and the voice of mr heelas bellowing like a bull
shut the doors shut the windows shut everythingthe invisible man is coming
instantly the house was full of screams and directions and scurrying feet
he ran himself to shut the french windows that opened on the veranda as he did so kemp's head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the garden fence
in another moment kemp had ploughed through the asparagus and was running across the tennis lawn to the house
you can't come in said mr heelas shutting the bolts
i'm very sorry if he's after you but you can't come in
kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass rapping and then shaking frantically at the french window
then seeing his efforts were useless he ran along the veranda vaulted the end and went to hammer at the side door
then he ran round by the side gate to the front of the house and so into the hillroad
and mr heelas staring from his windowa face of horrorhad scarcely witnessed kemp vanish ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen
at that mr heelas fled precipitately upstairs and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview
but as he passed the staircase window he heard the side gate slam
emerging into the hillroad kemp naturally took the downward direction and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only four days ago
he ran it well for a man out of training and though his face was white and wet his wits were cool to the last
he ran with wide strides and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened wherever there came a patch of raw flints or a bit of broken glass shone dazzling he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would
for the first time in his life kemp discovered that the hillroad was indescribably vast and desolate and that the beginnings of the town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote
never had there been a slower or more painful method of progression than running
all the gaunt villas sleeping in the afternoon sun looked locked and barred no doubt they were locked and barredby his own orders
but at any rate they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this
the town was rising up now the sea had dropped out of sight behind it and people down below were stirring
a tram was just arriving at the hill foot
beyond that was the police station
was that footsteps he heard behind him
spurt
the people below were staring at him one or two were running and his breath was beginning to saw in his throat
the tram was quite near now and the jolly cricketers was noisily barring its doors
beyond the tram were posts and heaps of gravelthe drainage works
he had a transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors and then he resolved to go for the police station
in another moment he had passed the door of the jolly cricketers and was in the blistering fag end of the street with human beings about him
the tram driver and his helperarrested by the sight of his furious hastestood staring with the tram horses unhitched
further on the astonished features of navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel
his pace broke a little and then he heard the swift pad of his pursuer and leapt forward again
the invisible man
he cried to the navvies with a vague indicative gesture and by an inspiration leapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase
then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side street rushed by a greengrocer's cart hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff shop and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into the main hill street again
two or three little children were playing here and shrieked and scattered at his apparition and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts
out he shot into hill street again three hundred yards from the tramline end and immediately he became aware of a tumultuous vociferation and running people
he glanced up the street towards the hill
hardly a dozen yards off ran a huge navvy cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched
up the street others followed these two striking and shouting
down towards the town men and women were running and he noticed clearly one man coming out of a shopdoor with a stick in his hand
spread out
spread out
cried some one
kemp suddenly grasped the altered condition of the chase
he stopped and looked round panting
he's close here
he cried
form a line across  he was hit hard under the ear and went reeling trying to face round towards his unseen antagonist
he just managed to keep his feet and he struck a vain counter in the air
then he was hit again under the jaw and sprawled headlong on the ground
in another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm and a couple of eager hands gripped his throat but the grip of one was weaker than the other he grasped the wrists heard a cry of pain from his assailant and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through the air above him and struck something with a dull thud
he felt a drop of moisture on his face
the grip at his throat suddenly relaxed and with a convulsive effort kemp loosed himself grasped a limp shoulder and rolled uppermost
he gripped the unseen elbows near the ground
i've got him
screamed kemp
help
helphold
he's down
hold his feet
in another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an exceptionally savage game of rugby football was in progress
and there was no shouting after kemp's cryonly a sound of blows and feet and heavy breathing
then came a mighty effort and the invisible man threw off a couple of his antagonists and rose to his knees
kemp clung to him in front like a hound to a stag and a dozen hands gripped clutched and tore at the unseen
the tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and lugged him back
down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over
there was i am afraid some savage kicking
then suddenly a wild scream of mercy
mercy
that died down swiftly to a sound like choking
get back you fools
cried the muffled voice of kemp and there was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms
he's hurt i tell you
stand back
there was a brief struggle to clear a space and then the circle of eager faces saw the doctor kneeling as it seemed fifteen inches in the air and holding invisible arms to the ground
behind him a constable gripped invisible ankles
don't you leave go of en cried the big navvy holding a bloodstained spade he's shamming
he's not shamming said the doctor cautiously raising his knee and i'll hold him
his face was bruised and already going red he spoke thickly because of a bleeding lip
he released one hand and seemed to be feeling at the face
the mouth's all wet he said
and then good god
he stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of the thing unseen
there was a pushing and shuffling a sound of heavy feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd
people now were coming out of the houses
the doors of the jolly cricketers stood suddenly wide open
very little was said
kemp felt about his hand seeming to pass through empty air
he's not breathing he said and then i can't feel his heart
his sideugh
suddenly an old woman peering under the arm of the big navvy screamed sharply
looky there
she said and thrust out a wrinkled finger
and looking where she pointed everyone saw faint and transparent as though it was made of glass so that veins and arteries and bones and nerves could be distinguished the outline of a hand a hand limp and prone
it grew clouded and opaque even as they stared
hullo
cried the constable
here's his feet ashowing
and so slowly beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his limbs to the vital centres of his body that strange change continued
it was like the slow spreading of a poison
first came the little white nerves a hazy grey sketch of a limb then the glassy bones and intricate arteries then the flesh and skin first a faint fogginess and then growing rapidly dense and opaque
presently they could see his crushed chest and his shoulders and the dim outline of his drawn and battered features
when at last the crowd made way for kemp to stand erect there lay naked and pitiful on the ground the bruised and broken body of a young man about thirty
his hair and brow were whitenot grey with age but white with the whiteness of albinismand his eyes were like garnets
his hands were clenched his eyes wide open and his expression was one of anger and dismay
cover his face
said a man
for gawd's sake cover that face
and three little children pushing forward through the crowd were suddenly twisted round and sent packing off again
someone brought a sheet from the jolly cricketers and having covered him they carried him into that house
and there it was on a shabby bed in a tawdry illlighted bedroom surrounded by a crowd of ignorant and excited people broken and wounded betrayed and unpitied that griffin the first of all men to make himself invisible griffin the most gifted physicist the world has ever seen ended in infinite disaster his strange and terrible career
the epilogue   so ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of the invisible man
and if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn near port stowe and talk to the landlord
the sign of the inn is an empty board save for a hat and boots and the name is the title of this story
the landlord is a short and corpulent little man with a nose of cylindrical proportions wiry hair and a sporadic rosiness of visage
drink generously and he will tell you generously of all the things that happened to him after that time and of how the lawyers tried to do him out of the treasure found upon him
when they found they couldn't prove whose money was which i'm blessed he says if they didn't try to make me out a blooming treasure trove
do i look like a treasure trove
and then a gentleman gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the empire music 'alljust to tell 'em in my own wordsbarring one
and if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly you can always do so by asking if there weren't three manuscript books in the story
he admits there were and proceeds to explain with asseverations that everybody thinks he has 'em
but bless you
he hasn't
the invisible man it was took 'em off to hide 'em when i cut and ran for port stowe
it's that mr kemp put people on with the idea of my having 'em
and then he subsides into a pensive state watches you furtively bustles nervously with glasses and presently leaves the bar
he is a bachelor manhis tastes were ever bachelor and there are no women folk in the house
outwardly he buttonsit is expected of himbut in his more vital privacies in the matter of braces for example he still turns to string
he conducts his house without enterprise but with eminent decorum
his movements are slow and he is a great thinker
but he has a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village and his knowledge of the roads of the south of england would beat cobbett
and on sunday mornings every sunday morning all the year round while he is closed to the outer world and every night after ten he goes into his bar parlour bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged with water and having placed this down he locks the door and examines the blinds and even looks under the table
and then being satisfied of his solitude he unlocks the cupboard and a box in the cupboard and a drawer in that box and produces three volumes bound in brown leather and places them solemnly in the middle of the table
the covers are weatherworn and tinged with an algal greenfor once they sojourned in a ditch and some of the pages have been washed blank by dirty water
the landlord sits down in an armchair fills a long clay pipe slowlygloating over the books the while
then he pulls one towards him and opens it and begins to study itturning over the leaves backwards and forwards
his brows are knit and his lips move painfully
hex little two up in the air cross and a fiddlededee
lord
what a one he was for intellect
presently he relaxes and leans back and blinks through his smoke across the room at things invisible to other eyes
full of secrets he says
wonderful secrets
once i get the haul of themlord
i wouldn't do what he did i'd justwell
he pulls at his pipe
so he lapses into a dream the undying wonderful dream of his life
and though kemp has fished unceasingly no human being save the landlord knows those books are there with the subtle secret of invisibility and a dozen other strange secrets written therein
and none other will know of them until he dies
book one  the coming of the martians    chapter one  the eve of the war   no one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water
with infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs serene in their assurance of their empire over matter
it is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same
no one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable
it is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days
at most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon mars perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise
yet across the gulf of space minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us
and early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment
the planet mars i scarcely need remind the reader revolves about the sun at a mean distance of  miles and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world
it must be if the nebular hypothesis has any truth older than our world and long before this earth ceased to be molten life upon its surface must have begun its course
the fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin
it has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence
yet so vain is man and so blinded by his vanity that no writer up to the very end of the nineteenth century expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far or indeed at all beyond its earthly level
nor was it generally understood that since mars is older than our earth with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end
the secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour
its physical condition is still largely a mystery but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter
its air is much more attenuated than ours its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones
that last stage of exhaustion which to us is still incredibly remote has become a presentday problem for the inhabitants of mars
the immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects enlarged their powers and hardened their hearts
and looking across space with instruments and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of they see at its nearest distance only  of miles sunward of them a morning star of hope our own warmer planet green with vegetation and grey with water with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow navycrowded seas
and we men the creatures who inhabit this earth must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us
the intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon mars
their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals
to carry warfare sunward is indeed their only escape from the destruction that generation after generation creeps upon them
and before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought not only upon animals such as the vanished bison and the dodo but upon its inferior races
the tasmanians in spite of their human likeness were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by european immigrants in the space of fifty years
are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the martians warred in the same spirit
the martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtletytheir mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of oursand to have carried out their preparations with a wellnigh perfect unanimity
had our instruments permitted it we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century
men like schiaparelli watched the red planetit is odd bythebye that for countless centuries mars has been the star of warbut failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well
all that time the martians must have been getting ready
during the opposition of  a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk first at the lick observatory then by perrotin of nice and then by other observers
english readers heard of it first in the issue of nature dated august 
i am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun in the vast pit sunk into their planet from which their shots were fired at us
peculiar markings as yet unexplained were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions
the storm burst upon us six years ago now
as mars approached opposition lavelle of java set the wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet
it had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth and the spectroscope to which he had at once resorted indicated a mass of flaming gas chiefly hydrogen moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth
this jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve
he compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet as flaming gases rushed out of a gun
a singularly appropriate phrase it proved
yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the daily telegraph and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race
i might not have heard of the eruption at all had i not met ogilvy the wellknown astronomer at ottershaw
he was immensely excited at the news and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet
in spite of all that has happened since i still remember that vigil very distinctly the black and silent observatory the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope the little slit in the roofan oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it
ogilvy moved about invisible but audible
looking through the telescope one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field
it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
but so little it was so silvery warma pin'shead of light
it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede but that was simply that my eye was tired
forty millions of miles it was from usmore than forty millions of miles of void
few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims
near it in the field i remember were three faint points of light three telescopic stars infinitely remote and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space
you know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night
in a telescope it seems far profounder
and invisible to me because it was so remote and small flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles came the thing they were sending us the thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth
i never dreamed of it then as i watched no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile
that night too there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
i saw it
a reddish flash at the edge the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight and at that i told ogilvy and he took my place
the night was warm and i was thirsty and i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness to the little table where the siphon stood while ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us
that night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from mars just a second or so under twentyfour hours after the first one
i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
i wished i had a light to smoke by little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam i had seen and all that it would presently bring me
ogilvy watched till one and then gave it up and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
down below in the darkness were ottershaw and chertsey and all their hundreds of people sleeping in peace
he was full of speculation that night about the condition of mars and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us
his idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress
he pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets
the chances against anything manlike on mars are a million to one he said
hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight and again the night after and so for ten nights a flame each night
why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain
it may be the gases of the firing caused the martians inconvenience
dense clouds of smoke or dust visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey fluctuating patches spread through the clearness of the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last and popular notes appeared here there and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon mars
the seriocomic periodical punch i remember made a happy use of it in the political cartoon
and all unsuspected those missiles the martians had fired at us drew earthward rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space hour by hour and day by day nearer and nearer
it seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that with that swift fate hanging over us men could go about their petty concerns as they did
i remember how jubilant markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days
people in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenthcentury papers
for my own part i was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed
one night the first missile then could scarcely have been  miles away i went for a walk with my wife
it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her and pointed out mars a bright dot of light creeping zenithward towards which so many telescopes were pointed
it was a warm night
coming home a party of excursionists from chertsey or isleworth passed us singing and playing music
there were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed
from the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains ringing and rumbling softened almost into melody by the distance
my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky
it seemed so safe and tranquil
chapter two  the falling star   then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds
denning our greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
i was at home at that hour and writing in my study and although my french windows face towards ottershaw and the blind was up for i loved in those days to look up at the night sky i saw nothing of it
yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while i was sitting there visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
i myself heard nothing of that
many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen the fall of it and at most have thought that another meteorite had descended
no one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night
but very early in the morning poor ogilvy who had seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between horsell ottershaw and woking rose early with the idea of finding it
find it he did soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
an enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath forming heaps visible a mile and a half away
the heather was on fire eastward and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn
the thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent
the uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly duncoloured incrustation
it had a diameter of about thirty yards
he approached the mass surprised at the size and more so at the shape since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely
it was however still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach
a stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
he remained standing at the edge of the pit that the thing had made for itself staring at its strange appearance astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival
the early morning was wonderfully still and the sun just clearing the pine trees towards weybridge was already warm
he did not remember hearing any birds that morning there was certainly no breeze stirring and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder
he was all alone on the common
then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite was falling off the circular edge of the end
it was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand
a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth
for a minute he scarcely realised what this meant and although the heat was excessive he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the thing more clearly
he fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder
and then he perceived that very slowly the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
it was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference
even then he scarcely understood what this indicated until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
then the thing came upon him in a flash
the cylinder was artificialhollowwith an end that screwed out
something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top
good heavens
said ogilvy
there's a man in itmen in it
half roasted to death
trying to escape
at once with a quick mental leap he linked the thing with the flash upon mars
the thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn
but luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the stillglowing metal
at that he stood irresolute for a moment then turned scrambled out of the pit and set off running wildly into woking
the time then must have been somewhere about six o'clock
he met a waggoner and tried to make him understand but the tale he told and his appearance were so wildhis hat had fallen off in the pitthat the man simply drove on
he was equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors of the publichouse by horsell bridge
the fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom
that sobered him a little and when he saw henderson the london journalist in his garden he called over the palings and made himself understood
henderson he called you saw that shooting star last night
well
said henderson
it's out on horsell common now
good lord
said henderson
fallen meteorite
that's good
but it's something more than a meteorite
it's a cylinderan artificial cylinder man
and there's something inside
henderson stood up with his spade in his hand
what's that
he said
he was deaf in one ear
ogilvy told him all that he had seen
henderson was a minute or so taking it in
then he dropped his spade snatched up his jacket and came out into the road
the two men hurried back at once to the common and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
but now the sounds inside had ceased and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
they listened rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick and meeting with no response they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead
of course the two were quite unable to do anything
they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
one can imagine them covered with sand excited and disordered running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
henderson went into the railway station at once in order to telegraph the news to london
the newspaper articles had prepared men's minds for the reception of the idea
by eight o'clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started for the common to see the dead men from mars
that was the form the story took
i heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when i went out to get my daily chronicle
i was naturally startled and lost no time in going out and across the ottershaw bridge to the sand pits
chapter three  on horsell common   i found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay
i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk embedded in the ground
the turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
no doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire
henderson and ogilvy were not there
i think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present and had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
there were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the pit with their feet dangling and amusing themselvesuntil i stopped themby throwing stones at the giant mass
after i had spoken to them about it they began playing at touch in and out of the group of bystanders
among these were a couple of cyclists a jobbing gardener i employed sometimes a girl carrying a baby gregg the butcher and his little boy and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway station
there was very little talking
few of the common people in england had anything but the vaguest astronomical ideas in those days
most of them were staring quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder which was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
i fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
some went away while i was there and other people came
i clambered into the pit and fancied i heard a faint movement under my feet
the top had certainly ceased to rotate
it was only when i got thus close to it that the strangeness of this object was at all evident to me
at the first glance it was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
not so much so indeed
it looked like a rusty gas float
it required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the thing was no common oxide that the yellowishwhite metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue
extraterrestrial had no meaning for most of the onlookers
at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars but i judged it improbable that it contained any living creature
i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
in spite of ogilvy i still believed that there were men in mars
my mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript on the difficulties in translation that might arise whether we should find coins and models in it and so forth
yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea
i felt an impatience to see it opened
about eleven as nothing seemed happening i walked back full of such thought to my home in maybury
but i found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations
in the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much
the early editions of the evening papers had startled london with enormous headlines    a message received from mars
remarkable story from woking  and so forth
in addition ogilvy's wire to the astronomical exchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms
there were half a dozen flies or more from the woking station standing in the road by the sand pits a basketchaise from chobham and a rather lordly carriage
besides that there was quite a heap of bicycles
in addition a large number of people must have walked in spite of the heat of the day from woking and chertsey so that there was altogether quite a considerable crowdone or two gaily dressed ladies among the others
it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
the burning heather had been extinguished but the level ground towards ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke
an enterprising sweetstuff dealer in the chobham road had sent up his son with a barrowload of green apples and ginger beer
going to the edge of the pit i found it occupied by a group of about half a dozen menhenderson ogilvy and a tall fairhaired man that i afterwards learned was stent the astronomer royal with several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes
stent was giving directions in a clear highpitched voice
he was standing on the cylinder which was now evidently much cooler his face was crimson and streaming with perspiration and something seemed to have irritated him
a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered though its lower end was still embedded
as soon as ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down and asked me if i would mind going over to see lord hilton the lord of the manor
the growing crowd he said was becoming a serious impediment to their excavations especially the boys
they wanted a light railing put up and help to keep the people back
he told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still audible within the case but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top as it afforded no grip to them
the case appeared to be enormously thick and it was possible that the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior
i was very glad to do as he asked and so become one of the privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure
i failed to find lord hilton at his house but i was told he was expected from london by the six o'clock train from waterloo and as it was then about a quarter past five i went home had some tea and walked up to the station to waylay him
chapter four  the cylinder opens   when i returned to the common the sun was setting
scattered groups were hurrying from the direction of woking and one or two persons were returning
the crowd about the pit had increased and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the skya couple of hundred people perhaps
there were raised voices and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on about the pit
strange imaginings passed through my mind
as i drew nearer i heard stent's voice  keep back
keep back
a boy came running towards me
it's amovin' he said to me as he passed ascrewin' and ascrewin' out
i don't like it
i'm agoin' 'ome i am
i went on to the crowd
there were really i should think two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another the one or two ladies there being by no means the least active
he's fallen in the pit
cried some one
keep back
said several
the crowd swayed a little and i elbowed my way through
every one seemed greatly excited
i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
i say
said ogilvy help keep these idiots back
we don't know what's in the confounded thing you know
i saw a young man a shop assistant in woking i believe he was standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again
the crowd had pushed him in
the end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within
nearly two feet of shining screw projected
somebody blundered against me and i narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw
i turned and as i did so the screw must have come out for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion
i stuck my elbow into the person behind me and turned my head towards the thing again
for a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black
i had the sunset in my eyes
i think everyone expected to see a man emergepossibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men but in all essentials a man
i know i did
but looking i presently saw something stirring within the shadow greyish billowy movements one above another and then two luminous diskslike eyes
then something resembling a little grey snake about the thickness of a walking stick coiled up out of the writhing middle and wriggled in the air towards meand then another
a sudden chill came over me
there was a loud shriek from a woman behind
i half turned keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still from which other tentacles were now projecting and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit
i saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me
i heard inarticulate exclamations on all sides
there was a general movement backwards
i saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit
i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off stent among them
i looked again at the cylinder and ungovernable terror gripped me
i stood petrified and staring
a big greyish rounded bulk the size perhaps of a bear was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder
as it bulged up and caught the light it glistened like wet leather
two large darkcoloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly
the mass that framed them the head of the thing was rounded and had one might say a face
there was a mouth under the eyes the lipless brim of which quivered and panted and dropped saliva
the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively
a lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder another swayed in the air
those who have never seen a living martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance
the peculiar vshaped mouth with its pointed upper lip the absence of brow ridges the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip the incessant quivering of this mouth the gorgon groups of tentacles the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earthabove all the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyeswere at once vital intense inhuman crippled and monstrous
there was something fungoid in the oily brown skin something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty
even at this first encounter this first glimpse i was overcome with disgust and dread
suddenly the monster vanished
it had toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit with a thud like the fall of a great mass of leather
i heard it give a peculiar thick cry and forthwith another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture
i turned and running madly made for the first group of trees perhaps a hundred yards away but i ran slantingly and stumbling for i could not avert my face from these things
there among some young pine trees and furze bushes i stopped panting and waited further developments
the common round the sand pits was dotted with people standing like myself in a halffascinated terror staring at these creatures or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay
and then with a renewed horror i saw a round black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit
it was the head of the shopman who had fallen in but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun
now he got his shoulder and knee up and again he seemed to slip back until only his head was visible
suddenly he vanished and i could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me
i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him that my fears overruled
everything was then quite invisible hidden by the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made
anyone coming along the road from chobham or woking would have been amazed at the sighta dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular circle in ditches behind bushes behind gates and hedges saying little to one another and that in short excited shouts and staring staring hard at a few heaps of sand
the barrow of ginger beer stood a queer derelict black against the burning sky and in the sand pits was a row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground
chapter five  the heatray   after the glimpse i had had of the martians emerging from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet a kind of fascination paralysed my actions
i remained standing kneedeep in the heather staring at the mound that hid them
i was a battleground of fear and curiosity
i did not dare to go back towards the pit but i felt a passionate longing to peer into it
i began walking therefore in a big curve seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand heaps that hid these newcomers to our earth
once a leash of thin black whips like the arms of an octopus flashed across the sunset and was immediately withdrawn and afterwards a thin rod rose up joint by joint bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion
what could be going on there
most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groupsone a little crowd towards woking the other a knot of people in the direction of chobham
evidently they shared my mental conflict
there were few near me
one man i approachedhe was i perceived a neighbour of mine though i did not know his nameand accosted
but it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation
what ugly brutes
he said
good god
what ugly brutes
he repeated this over and over again
did you see a man in the pit
i said but he made no answer to that
we became silent and stood watching for a time side by side deriving i fancy a certain comfort in one another's company
then i shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of elevation and when i looked for him presently he was walking towards woking
the sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened
the crowd far away on the left towards woking seemed to grow and i heard now a faint murmur from it
the little knot of people towards chobham dispersed
there was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit
it was this as much as anything that gave people courage and i suppose the new arrivals from woking also helped to restore confidence
at any rate as the dusk came on a slow intermittent movement upon the sand pits began a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken
vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance stop watch and advance again spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns
i too on my side began to move towards the pit
then i saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels
i saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples
and then within thirty yards of the pit advancing from the direction of horsell i noted a little black knot of men the foremost of whom was waving a white flag
this was the deputation
there had been a hasty consultation and since the martians were evidently in spite of their repulsive forms intelligent creatures it had been resolved to show them by approaching them with signals that we too were intelligent
flutter flutter went the flag first to the right then to the left
it was too far for me to recognise anyone there but afterwards i learned that ogilvy stent and henderson were with others in this attempt at communication
this little group had in its advance dragged inward so to speak the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people and a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet distances
suddenly there was a flash of light and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs which drove up one after the other straight into the still air
this smoke or flame perhaps would be the better word for it was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towards chertsey set with black pine trees seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose and to remain the darker after their dispersal
at the same time a faint hissing sound became audible
beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex arrested by these phenomena a little knot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground
as the green smoke arose their faces flashed out pallid green and faded again as it vanished
then slowly the hissing passed into a humming into a long loud droning noise
slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it
forthwith flashes of actual flame a bright glare leaping from one to another sprang from the scattered group of men
it was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame
it was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire
then by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
i stood staring not as yet realising that this was death leaping from man to man in that little distant crowd
all i felt was that it was something very strange
an almost noiseless and blinding flash of light and a man fell headlong and lay still and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them pine trees burst into fire and every dry furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames
and far away towards knaphill i saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set alight
it was sweeping round swiftly and steadily this flaming death this invisible inevitable sword of heat
i perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched and was too astounded and stupefied to stir
i heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled
then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the martians and all along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled
something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from woking station opens out on the common
forthwith the hissing and humming ceased and the black domelike object sank slowly out of sight into the pit
all this had happened with such swiftness that i had stood motionless dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light
had that death swept through a full circle it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise
but it passed and spared me and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar
the undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness except where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early night
it was dark and suddenly void of men
overhead the stars were mustering and in the west the sky was still a pale bright almost greenish blue
the tops of the pine trees and the roofs of horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow
the martians and their appliances were altogether invisible save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled
patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and glowed still and the houses towards woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air
nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment
the little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence and the stillness of the evening so it seemed to me had scarcely been broken
it came to me that i was upon this dark common helpless unprotected and alone
suddenly like a thing falling upon me from without camefear
with an effort i turned and began a stumbling run through the heather
the fear i felt was no rational fear but a panic terror not only of the martians but of the dusk and stillness all about me
such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that i ran weeping silently as a child might do
once i had turned i did not dare to look back
i remember i felt an extraordinary persuasion that i was being played with that presently when i was upon the very verge of safety this mysterious deathas swift as the passage of lightwould leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down
chapter six  the heatray in the chobham road   it is still a matter of wonder how the martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently
many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute nonconductivity
this intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light
but no one has absolutely proved these details
however it is done it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter
heat and invisible instead of visible light
whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch lead runs like water it softens iron cracks and melts glass and when it falls upon water incontinently that explodes into steam
that night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit charred and distorted beyond recognition and all night long the common from horsell to maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze
the news of the massacre probably reached chobham woking and ottershaw about the same time
in woking the shops had closed when the tragedy happened and a number of people shop people and so forth attracted by the stories they had heard were walking over the horsell bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon the common
you may imagine the young people brushed up after the labours of the day and making this novelty as they would make any novelty the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial flirtation
you may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road in the gloaming     as yet of course few people in woking even knew that the cylinder had opened though poor henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the post office with a special wire to an evening paper
as these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open they found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning mirror over the sand pits and the newcomers were no doubt soon infected by the excitement of the occasion
by half past eight when the deputation was destroyed there may have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place besides those who had left the road to approach the martians nearer
there were three policemen too one of whom was mounted doing their best under instructions from stent to keep the people back and deter them from approaching the cylinder
there was some booing from those more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion for noise and horseplay
stent and ogilvy anticipating some possibilities of a collision had telegraphed from horsell to the barracks as soon as the martians emerged for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange creatures from violence
after that they returned to lead that illfated advance
the description of their death as it was seen by the crowd tallies very closely with my own impressions the three puffs of green smoke the deep humming note and the flashes of flame
but that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine
only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the heatray saved them
had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher none could have lived to tell the tale
they saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand as it were lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight
then with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit the beam swung close over their heads lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road and splitting the bricks smashing the windows firing the window frames and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner
in the sudden thud hiss and glare of the igniting trees the panicstricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments
sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road and single leaves like puffs of flame
hats and dresses caught fire
then came a crying from the common
there were shrieks and shouts and suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with his hands clasped over his head screaming
they're coming
a woman shrieked and incontinently everyone was turning and pushing at those behind in order to clear their way to woking again
they must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep
where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd jammed and a desperate struggle occurred
all that crowd did not escape three persons at least two women and a little boy were crushed and trampled there and left to die amid the terror and the darkness
chapter seven  how i reached home   for my own part i remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather
all about me gathered the invisible terrors of the martians that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life
i came into the road between the crossroads and horsell and ran along this to the crossroads
at last i could go no further i was exhausted with the violence of my emotion and of my flight and i staggered and fell by the wayside
that was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks
i fell and lay still
i must have remained there some time
i sat up strangely perplexed
for a moment perhaps i could not clearly understand how i came there
my terror had fallen from me like a garment
my hat had gone and my collar had burst away from its fastener
a few minutes before there had only been three real things before methe immensity of the night and space and nature my own feebleness and anguish and the near approach of death
now it was as if something turned over and the point of view altered abruptly
there was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other
i was immediately the self of every day againa decent ordinary citizen
the silent common the impulse of my flight the starting flames were as if they had been in a dream
i asked myself had these latter things indeed happened
i could not credit it
i rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge
my mind was blank wonder
my muscles and nerves seemed drained of their strength
i dare say i staggered drunkenly
a head rose over the arch and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared
beside him ran a little boy
he passed me wishing me good night
i was minded to speak to him but did not
i answered his greeting with a meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge
over the maybury arch a train a billowing tumult of white firelit smoke and a long caterpillar of lighted windows went flying southclatter clatter clap rap and it had gone
a dim group of people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row of gables that was called oriental terrace
it was all so real and so familiar
and that behind me
it was frantic fantastic
such things i told myself could not be
perhaps i am a man of exceptional moods
i do not know how far my experience is common
at times i suffer from the strangest sense of detachment from myself and the world about me i seem to watch it all from the outside from somewhere inconceivably remote out of time out of space out of the stress and tragedy of it all
this feeling was very strong upon me that night
here was another side to my dream
but the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the swift death flying yonder not two miles away
there was a noise of business from the gasworks and the electric lamps were all alight
i stopped at the group of people
what news from the common
said i
there were two men and a woman at the gate
eh
said one of the men turning
what news from the common
i said
'ain't yer just been there
asked the men
people seem fair silly about the common said the woman over the gate
what's it all abart
haven't you heard of the men from mars
said i the creatures from mars
quite enough said the woman over the gate
thenks and all three of them laughed
i felt foolish and angry
i tried and found i could not tell them what i had seen
they laughed again at my broken sentences
you'll hear more yet i said and went on to my home
i startled my wife at the doorway so haggard was i  i went into the dining room sat down drank some wine and so soon as i could collect myself sufficiently i told her the things i had seen
the dinner which was a cold one had already been served and remained neglected on the table while i told my story
there is one thing i said to allay the fears i had aroused they are the most sluggish things i ever saw crawl
they may keep the pit and kill people who come near them but they cannot get out of it   
but the horror of them
don't dear
said my wife knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine
poor ogilvy
i said
to think he may be lying dead there
my wife at least did not find my experience incredible
when i saw how deadly white her face was i ceased abruptly
they may come here she said again and again
i pressed her to take wine and tried to reassure her
they can scarcely move i said
i began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that ogilvy had told me of the impossibility of the martians establishing themselves on the earth
in particular i laid stress on the gravitational difficulty
on the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of mars
a martian therefore would weigh three times more than on mars albeit his muscular strength would be the same
his own body would be a cope of lead to him
that indeed was the general opinion
both the times and the daily telegraph for instance insisted on it the next morning and both overlooked just as i did two obvious modifying influences
the atmosphere of the earth we now know contains far more oxygen or far less argon whichever way one likes to put it than does mars
the invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies
and in the second place we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the martian possessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch
but i did not consider these points at the time and so my reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders
with wine and food the confidence of my own table and the necessity of reassuring my wife i grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure
they have done a foolish thing said i fingering my wineglass
they are dangerous because no doubt they are mad with terror
perhaps they expected to find no living thingscertainly no intelligent living things
a shell in the pit said i if the worst comes to the worst will kill them all
the intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive powers in a state of erethism
i remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividness even now
my dear wife's sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniturefor in those days even philosophical writers had many little luxuriesthe crimsonpurple wine in my glass are photographically distinct
at the end of it i sat tempering nuts with a cigarette regretting ogilvy's rashness and denouncing the shortsighted timidity of the martians
so some respectable dodo in the mauritius might have lorded it in his nest and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in want of animal food
we will peck them to death tomorrow my dear
i did not know it but that was the last civilised dinner i was to eat for very many strange and terrible days
chapter eight  friday night   the most extraordinary thing to my mind of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that friday was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong
if on friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the woking sand pits i doubt if you would have had one human being outside it unless it were some relation of stent or of the three or four cyclists or london people lying dead on the common whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the newcomers
many people had heard of the cylinder of course and talked about it in their leisure but it certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to germany would have done
in london that night poor henderson's telegram describing the gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard and his evening paper after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no replythe man was killeddecided not to print a special edition
even within the fivemile circle the great majority of people were inert
i have already described the behaviour of the men and women to whom i spoke
all over the district people were dining and supping working men were gardening after the labours of the day children were being put to bed young people were wandering through the lanes lovemaking students sat over their books
maybe there was a murmur in the village streets a novel and dominant topic in the publichouses and here and there a messenger or even an eyewitness of the later occurrences caused a whirl of excitement a shouting and a running to and fro but for the most part the daily routine of working eating drinking sleeping went on as it had done for countless yearsas though no planet mars existed in the sky
even at woking station and horsell and chobham that was the case
in woking junction until a late hour trains were stopping and going on others were shunting on the sidings passengers were alighting and waiting and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way
a boy from the town trenching on smith's monopoly was selling papers with the afternoon's news
the ringing impact of trucks the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction mingled with their shouts of men from mars
excited men came into the station about nine o'clock with incredible tidings and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might have done
people rattling londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows and saw only a rare flickering vanishing spark dance up from the direction of horsell a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening
it was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible
there were half a dozen villas burning on the woking border
there were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages and the people there kept awake till dawn
a curious crowd lingered restlessly people coming and going but the crowd remaining both on the chobham and horsell bridges
one or two adventurous souls it was afterwards found went into the darkness and crawled quite near the martians but they never returned for now and again a lightray like the beam of a warship's searchlight swept the common and the heatray was ready to follow
save for such that big area of common was silent and desolate and the charred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars and all the next day
a noise of hammering from the pit was heard by many people
so you have the state of things on friday night
in the centre sticking into the skin of our old planet earth like a poisoned dart was this cylinder
but the poison was scarcely working yet
around it was a patch of silent common smouldering in places and with a few dark dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there
here and there was a burning bush or tree
beyond was a fringe of excitement and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept as yet
in the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years
the fever of war that would presently clog vein and artery deaden nerve and destroy brain had still to develop
all night long the martians were hammering and stirring sleepless indefatigable at work upon the machines they were making ready and ever and again a puff of greenishwhite smoke whirled up to the starlit sky
about eleven a company of soldiers came through horsell and deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon
later a second company marched through chobham to deploy on the north side of the common
several officers from the inkerman barracks had been on the common earlier in the day and one major eden was reported to be missing
the colonel of the regiment came to the chobham bridge and was busy questioning the crowd at midnight
the military authorities were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business
about eleven the next morning's papers were able to say a squadron of hussars two maxims and about four hundred men of the cardigan regiment started from aldershot
a few seconds after midnight the crowd in the chertsey road woking saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest
it had a greenish colour and caused a silent brightness like summer lightning
this was the second cylinder
chapter nine  the fighting begins   saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense
it was a day of lassitude too hot and close with i am told a rapidly fluctuating barometer
i had slept but little though my wife had succeeded in sleeping and i rose early
i went into my garden before breakfast and stood listening but towards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark
the milkman came as usual
i heard the rattle of his chariot and i went round to the side gate to ask the latest news
he told me that during the night the martians had been surrounded by troops and that guns were expected
thena familiar reassuring notei heard a train running towards woking
they aren't to be killed said the milkman if that can possibly be avoided
i saw my neighbour gardening chatted with him for a time and then strolled in to breakfast
it was a most unexceptional morning
my neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to destroy the martians during the day
it's a pity they make themselves so unapproachable he said
it would be curious to know how they live on another planet we might learn a thing or two
he came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic
at the same time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the byfleet golf links
they say said he that there's another of those blessed things fallen therenumber two
but one's enough surely
this lot'll cost the insurance people a pretty penny before everything's settled
he laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this
the woods he said were still burning and pointed out a haze of smoke to me
they will be hot under foot for days on account of the thick soil of pine needles and turf he said and then grew serious over poor ogilvy
after breakfast instead of working i decided to walk down towards the common
under the railway bridge i found a group of soldierssappers i think men in small round caps dirty red jackets unbuttoned and showing their blue shirts dark trousers and boots coming to the calf
they told me no one was allowed over the canal and looking along the road towards the bridge i saw one of the cardigan men standing sentinel there
i talked with these soldiers for a time i told them of my sight of the martians on the previous evening
none of them had seen the martians and they had but the vaguest ideas of them so that they plied me with questions
they said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the troops their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the horse guards
the ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the common soldier and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness
i described the heatray to them and they began to argue among themselves
crawl up under cover and rush 'em say i said one
get aht
said another
what's cover against this 'ere 'eat
sticks to cook yer
what we got to do is to go as near as the ground'll let us and then drive a trench
blow yer trenches
you always want trenches you ought to ha' been born a rabbit snippy
ain't they got any necks then
said a third abruptlya little contemplative dark man smoking a pipe
i repeated my description
octopuses said he that's what i calls 'em
talk about fishers of menfighters of fish it is this time
it ain't no murder killing beasts like that said the first speaker
why not shell the darned things strite off and finish 'em
said the little dark man
you carn tell what they might do
where's your shells
said the first speaker
there ain't no time
do it in a rush that's my tip and do it at once
so they discussed it
after a while i left them and went on to the railway station to get as many morning papers as i could
but i will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning and of the longer afternoon
i did not succeed in getting a glimpse of the common for even horsell and chobham church towers were in the hands of the military authorities
the soldiers i addressed didn't know anything the officers were mysterious as well as busy
i found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military and i heard for the first time from marshall the tobacconist that his son was among the dead on the common
the soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of horsell lock up and leave their houses
i got back to lunch about two very tired for as i have said the day was extremely hot and dull and in order to refresh myself i took a cold bath in the afternoon
about half past four i went up to the railway station to get an evening paper for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of stent henderson ogilvy and the others
but there was little i didn't know
the martians did not show an inch of themselves
they seemed busy in their pit and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke
apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle
fresh attempts have been made to signal but without success was the stereotyped formula of the papers
a sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole
the martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow
i must confess the sight of all this armament all this preparation greatly excited me
my imagination became belligerent and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways something of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back
it hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time
they seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs
about three o'clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals from chertsey or addlestone
i learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled in the hope of destroying that object before it opened
it was only about five however that a field gun reached chobham for use against the first body of martians
about six in the evening as i sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us i heard a muffled detonation from the common and immediately after a gust of firing
close on the heels of that came a violent rattling crash quite close to us that shook the ground and starting out upon the lawn i saw the tops of the trees about the oriental college burst into smoky red flame and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin
the pinnacle of the mosque had vanished and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundredton gun had been at work upon it
one of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it flew and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window
i and my wife stood amazed
then i realised that the crest of maybury hill must be within range of the martians' heatray now that the college was cleared out of the way
at that i gripped my wife's arm and without ceremony ran her out into the road
then i fetched out the servant telling her i would go upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for
we can't possibly stay here i said and as i spoke the firing reopened for a moment upon the common
but where are we to go
said my wife in terror
i thought perplexed
then i remembered her cousins at leatherhead
leatherhead
i shouted above the sudden noise
she looked away from me downhill
the people were coming out of their houses astonished
how are we to get to leatherhead
she said
down the hill i saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge three galloped through the open gates of the oriental college two others dismounted and began running from house to house
the sun shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees seemed blood red and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything
stop here said i you are safe here and i started off at once for the spotted dog for i knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart
i ran for i perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving
i found him in his bar quite unaware of what was going on behind his house
a man stood with his back to me talking to him
i must have a pound said the landlord and i've no one to drive it
i'll give you two said i over the stranger's shoulder
what for
and i'll bring it back by midnight i said
lord
said the landlord what's the hurry
i'm selling my bit of a pig
two pounds and you bring it back
what's going on now
i explained hastily that i had to leave my home and so secured the dog cart
at the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave his
i took care to have the cart there and then drove it off down the road and leaving it in charge of my wife and servant rushed into my house and packed a few valuables such plate as we had and so forth
the beech trees below the house were burning while i did this and the palings up the road glowed red
while i was occupied in this way one of the dismounted hussars came running up
he was going from house to house warning people to leave
he was going on as i came out of my front door lugging my treasures done up in a tablecloth
i shouted after him  what news
he turned stared bawled something about crawling out in a thing like a dish cover and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest
a sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment
i ran to my neighbour's door and rapped to satisfy myself of what i already knew that his wife had gone to london with him and had locked up their house
i went in again according to my promise to get my servant's box lugged it out clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver's seat beside my wife
in another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise and spanking down the opposite slope of maybury hill towards old woking
in front was a quiet sunny landscape a wheat field ahead on either side of the road and the maybury inn with its swinging sign
i saw the doctor's cart ahead of me
at the bottom of the hill i turned my head to look at the hillside i was leaving
thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward
the smoke already extended far away to the east and westto the byfleet pine woods eastward and to woking on the west
the road was dotted with people running towards us
and very faint now but very distinct through the hot quiet air one heard the whirr of a machinegun that was presently stilled and an intermittent cracking of rifles
apparently the martians were setting fire to everything within range of their heatray
i am not an expert driver and i had immediately to turn my attention to the horse
when i looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke
i slashed the horse with the whip and gave him a loose rein until woking and send lay between us and that quivering tumult
i overtook and passed the doctor between woking and send
chapter ten  in the storm   leatherhead is about twelve miles from maybury hill
the scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond pyrford and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dogroses
the heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down maybury hill ceased as abruptly as it began leaving the evening very peaceful and still
we got to leatherhead without misadventure about nine o'clock and the horse had an hour's rest while i took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care
my wife was curiously silent throughout the drive and seemed oppressed with forebodings of evil
i talked to her reassuringly pointing out that the martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it but she answered only in monosyllables
had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper she would i think have urged me to stay in leatherhead that night
would that i had
her face i remember was very white as we parted
for my own part i had been feverishly excited all day
something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood and in my heart i was not so very sorry that i had to return to maybury that night
i was even afraid that that last fusillade i had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from mars
i can best express my state of mind by saying that i wanted to be in at the death
it was nearly eleven when i started to return
the night was unexpectedly dark to me walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins' house it seemed indeed black and it was as hot and close as the day
overhead the clouds were driving fast albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us
my cousins' man lit both lamps
happily i knew the road intimately
my wife stood in the light of the doorway and watched me until i jumped up into the dog cart
then abruptly she turned and went in leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap
i was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife's fears but very soon my thoughts reverted to the martians
at that time i was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening's fighting
i did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated the conflict
as i came through ockham for that was the way i returned and not through send and old woking i saw along the western horizon a bloodred glow which as i drew nearer crept slowly up the sky
the driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke
ripley street was deserted and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life but i narrowly escaped an accident at the corner of the road to pyrford where a knot of people stood with their backs to me
they said nothing to me as i passed
i do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill nor do i know if the silent houses i passed on my way were sleeping securely or deserted and empty or harassed and watching against the terror of the night
from ripley until i came through pyrford i was in the valley of the wey and the red glare was hidden from me
as i ascended the little hill beyond pyrford church the glare came into view again and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me
then i heard midnight pealing out from pyrford church behind me and then came the silhouette of maybury hill with its treetops and roofs black and sharp against the red
even as i beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards addlestone
i felt a tug at the reins
i saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left
it was the third falling star
close on its apparition and blindingly violet by contrast danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead
the horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted
a moderate incline runs towards the foot of maybury hill and down this we clattered
once the lightning had begun it went on in as rapid a succession of flashes as i have ever seen
the thunderclaps treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations
the flickering light was blinding and confusing and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as i drove down the slope
at first i regarded little but the road before me and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of maybury hill
at first i took it for the wet roof of a house but one flash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement
it was an elusive visiona moment of bewildering darkness and then in a flash like daylight the red masses of the orphanage near the crest of the hill the green tops of the pine trees and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright
and this thing i saw
how can i describe it
a monstrous tripod higher than many houses striding over the young pine trees and smashing them aside in its career a walking engine of glittering metal striding now across the heather articulate ropes of steel dangling from it and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder
a flash and it came out vividly heeling over one way with two feet in the air to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed with the next flash a hundred yards nearer
can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground
that was the impression those instant flashes gave
but instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand
then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them they were snapped off and driven headlong and a second huge tripod appeared rushing as it seemed headlong towards me
and i was galloping hard to meet it
at the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether
not stopping to look again i wrenched the horse's head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the horse the shafts smashed noisily and i was flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water
i crawled out almost immediately and crouched my feet still in the water under a clump of furze
the horse lay motionless his neck was broken poor brute
and by the lightning flashes i saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly
in another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by me and passed uphill towards pyrford
seen nearer the thing was incredibly strange for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way
machine it was with a ringing metallic pace and long flexible glittering tentacles one of which gripped a young pine tree swinging and rattling about its strange body
it picked its road as it went striding along and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about
behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman's basket and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me
and in an instant it was gone
so much i saw then all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning in blinding highlights and dense black shadows
as it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the thunderaloo
aloo
and in another minute it was with its companion half a mile away stooping over something in the field
i have no doubt this thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from mars
for some minutes i lay there in the rain and darkness watching by the intermittent light these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops
a thin hail was now beginning and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again
now and then came a gap in the lightning and the night swallowed them up
i was soaked with hail above and puddle water below
it was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position or think at all of my imminent peril
not far from me was a little oneroomed squatter's hut of wood surrounded by a patch of potato garden
i struggled to my feet at last and crouching and making use of every chance of cover i made a run for this
i hammered at the door but i could not make the people hear if there were any people inside and after a time i desisted and availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way succeeded in crawling unobserved by these monstrous machines into the pine woods towards maybury
under cover of this i pushed on wet and shivering now towards my own house
i walked among the trees trying to find the footpath
it was very dark indeed in the wood for the lightning was now becoming infrequent and the hail which was pouring down in a torrent fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage
if i had fully realised the meaning of all the things i had seen i should have immediately worked my way round through byfleet to street cobham and so gone back to rejoin my wife at leatherhead
but that night the strangeness of things about me and my physical wretchedness prevented me for i was bruised weary wet to the skin deafened and blinded by the storm
i had a vague idea of going on to my own house and that was as much motive as i had
i staggered through the trees fell into a ditch and bruised my knees against a plank and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from the college arms
i say splashed for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent
there in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back
he gave a cry of terror sprang sideways and rushed on before i could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him
so heavy was the stress of the storm just at this place that i had the hardest task to win my way up the hill
i went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way along its palings
near the top i stumbled upon something soft and by a flash of lightning saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots
before i could distinguish clearly how the man lay the flicker of light had passed
i stood over him waiting for the next flash
when it came i saw that he was a sturdy man cheaply but not shabbily dressed his head was bent under his body and he lay crumpled up close to the fence as though he had been flung violently against it
overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a dead body i stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart
he was quite dead
apparently his neck had been broken
the lightning flashed for a third time and his face leaped upon me
i sprang to my feet
it was the landlord of the spotted dog whose conveyance i had taken
i stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill
i made my way by the police station and the college arms towards my own house
nothing was burning on the hillside though from the common there still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail
so far as i could see by the flashes the houses about me were mostly uninjured
by the college arms a dark heap lay in the road
down the road towards maybury bridge there were voices and the sound of feet but i had not the courage to shout or to go to them
i let myself in with my latchkey closed locked and bolted the door staggered to the foot of the staircase and sat down
my imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters and of the dead body smashed against the fence
i crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall shivering violently
chapter eleven  at the window   i have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhausting themselves
after a time i discovered that i was cold and wet and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet
i got up almost mechanically went into the dining room and drank some whiskey and then i was moved to change my clothes
after i had done that i went upstairs to my study but why i did so i do not know
the window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towards horsell common
in the hurry of our departure this window had been left open
the passage was dark and by contrast with the picture the window frame enclosed the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark
i stopped short in the doorway
the thunderstorm had passed
the towers of the oriental college and the pine trees about it had gone and very far away lit by a vivid red glare the common about the sand pits was visible
across the light huge black shapes grotesque and strange moved busily to and fro
it seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on firea broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame swaying and writhing with the gusts of the dying storm and throwing a red reflection upon the cloudscud above
every now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid the martian shapes
i could not see what they were doing nor the clear form of them nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon
neither could i see the nearer fire though the reflections of it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study
a sharp resinous tang of burning was in the air
i closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window
as i did so the view opened out until on the one hand it reached to the houses about woking station and on the other to the charred and blackened pine woods of byfleet
there was a light down below the hill on the railway near the arch and several of the houses along the maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins
the light upon the railway puzzled me at first there were a black heap and a vivid glare and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs
then i perceived this was a wrecked train the fore part smashed and on fire the hinder carriages still upon the rails
between these three main centres of lightthe houses the train and the burning county towards chobhamstretched irregular patches of dark country broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking ground
it was the strangest spectacle that black expanse set with fire
it reminded me more than anything else of the potteries at night
at first i could distinguish no people at all though i peered intently for them
later i saw against the light of woking station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line
and this was the little world in which i had been living securely for years this fiery chaos
what had happened in the last seven hours i still did not know nor did i know though i was beginning to guess the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps i had seen disgorged from the cylinder
with a queer feeling of impersonal interest i turned my desk chair to the window sat down and stared at the blackened country and particularly at the three gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the sand pits
they seemed amazingly busy
i began to ask myself what they could be
were they intelligent mechanisms
such a thing i felt was impossible
or did a martian sit within each ruling directing using much as a man's brain sits and rules in his body
i began to compare the things to human machines to ask myself for the first time in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal
the storm had left the sky clear and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading pinpoint of mars was dropping into the west when a soldier came into my garden
i heard a slight scraping at the fence and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me i looked down and saw him dimly clambering over the palings
at the sight of another human being my torpor passed and i leaned out of the window eagerly
hist
said i in a whisper
he stopped astride of the fence in doubt
then he came over and across the lawn to the corner of the house
he bent down and stepped softly
who's there
he said also whispering standing under the window and peering up
where are you going
i asked
god knows
are you trying to hide
that's it
come into the house i said
i went down unfastened the door and let him in and locked the door again
i could not see his face
he was hatless and his coat was unbuttoned
my god
he said as i drew him in
what has happened
i asked
what hasn't
in the obscurity i could see he made a gesture of despair
they wiped us outsimply wiped us out he repeated again and again
he followed me almost mechanically into the dining room
take some whiskey i said pouring out a stiff dose
he drank it
then abruptly he sat down before the table put his head on his arms and began to sob and weep like a little boy in a perfect passion of emotion while i with a curious forgetfulness of my own recent despair stood beside him wondering
it was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my questions and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly
he was a driver in the artillery and had only come into action about seven
at that time firing was going on across the common and it was said the first party of martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover of a metal shield
later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of the fightingmachines i had seen
the gun he drove had been unlimbered near horsell in order to command the sand pits and its arrival it was that had precipitated the action
as the limber gunners went to the rear his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down throwing him into a depression of the ground
at the same moment the gun exploded behind him the ammunition blew up there was fire all about him and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses
i lay still he said scared out of my wits with the fore quarter of a horse atop of me
we'd been wiped out
and the smellgood god
like burnt meat
i was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse and there i had to lie until i felt better
just like parade it had been a minute beforethen stumble bang swish
wiped out
he said
he had hid under the dead horse for a long time peeping out furtively across the common
the cardigan men had tried a rush in skirmishing order at the pit simply to be swept out of existence
then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being
a kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case about which green flashes scintillated and out of the funnel of this there smoked the heatray
in a few minutes there was so far as the soldier could see not a living thing left upon the common and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning
the hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground and he saw nothing of them
he heard the maxims rattle for a time and then become still
the giant saved woking station and its cluster of houses until the last then in a moment the heatray was brought to bear and the town became a heap of fiery ruins
then the thing shut off the heatray and turning its back upon the artilleryman began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder
as it did so a second glittering titan built itself up out of the pit
the second monster followed the first and at that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards horsell
he managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the road and so escaped to woking
there his story became ejaculatory
the place was impassable
it seems there were a few people alive there frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded
he was turned aside by the fire and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the martian giants returned
he saw this one pursue a man catch him up in one of its steely tentacles and knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree
at last after nightfall the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment
since then he had been skulking along towards maybury in the hope of getting out of danger londonward
people were hiding in trenches and cellars and many of the survivors had made off towards woking village and send
he had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains near the railway arch smashed and the water bubbling out like a spring upon the road
that was the story i got from him bit by bit
he grew calmer telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen
he had eaten no food since midday he told me early in his narrative and i found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room
we lit no lamp for fear of attracting the martians and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat
as he talked things about us came darkly out of the darkness and the trampled bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct
it would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn
i began to see his face blackened and haggard as no doubt mine was also
when we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study and i looked again out of the open window
in one night the valley had become a valley of ashes
the fires had dwindled now
where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn
yet here and there some object had had the luck to escapea white railway signal here the end of a greenhouse there white and fresh amid the wreckage
never before in the history of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal
and shining with the growing light of the east three of the metallic giants stood about the pit their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the desolation they had made
it seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brightening dawnstreamed up whirled broke and vanished
beyond were the pillars of fire about chobham
they became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day
chapter twelve  what i saw of the destruction of weybridge and shepperton   as the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had watched the martians and went very quietly downstairs
the artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in
he proposed he said to make his way londonward and thence rejoin his batteryno
 of the horse artillery
my plan was to return at once to leatherhead and so greatly had the strength of the martians impressed me that i had determined to take my wife to newhaven and go with her out of the country forthwith
for i already perceived clearly that the country about london must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed
between us and leatherhead however lay the third cylinder with its guarding giants
had i been alone i think i should have taken my chance and struck across country
but the artilleryman dissuaded me it's no kindness to the right sort of wife he said to make her a widow and in the end i agreed to go with him under cover of the woods northward as far as street cobham before i parted with him
thence i would make a big detour by epsom to reach leatherhead
i should have started at once but my companion had been in active service and he knew better than that
he made me ransack the house for a flask which he filled with whiskey and we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat
then we crept out of the house and ran as quickly as we could down the illmade road by which i had come overnight
the houses seemed deserted
in the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together struck dead by the heatray and here and there were things that people had droppeda clock a slipper a silver spoon and the like poor valuables
at the corner turning up towards the post office a little cart filled with boxes and furniture and horseless heeled over on a broken wheel
a cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris
except the lodge at the orphanage which was still on fire none of the houses had suffered very greatly here
the heatray had shaved the chimney tops and passed
yet save ourselves there did not seem to be a living soul on maybury hill
the majority of the inhabitants had escaped i suppose by way of the old woking roadthe road i had taken when i drove to leatherheador they had hidden
we went down the lane by the body of the man in black sodden now from the overnight hail and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill
we pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul
the woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods for the most part the trees had fallen but a certain proportion still stood dismal grey stems with dark brown foliage instead of green
on our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees it had failed to secure its footing
in one place the woodmen had been at work on saturday trees felled and freshly trimmed lay in a clearing with heaps of sawdust by the sawingmachine and its engine
hard by was a temporary hut deserted
there was not a breath of wind this morning and everything was strangely still
even the birds were hushed and as we hurried along i and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders
once or twice we stopped to listen
after a time we drew near the road and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards woking
we hailed them and they halted while we hurried towards them
it was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the th hussars with a stand like a theodolite which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph
you are the first men i've seen coming this way this morning said the lieutenant
what's brewing
his voice and face were eager
the men behind him stared curiously
the artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted
gun destroyed last night sir
have been hiding
trying to rejoin battery sir
you'll come in sight of the martians i expect about half a mile along this road
what the dickens are they like
asked the lieutenant
giants in armour sir
hundred feet high
three legs and a body like 'luminium with a mighty great head in a hood sir
get out
said the lieutenant
what confounded nonsense
you'll see sir
they carry a kind of box sir that shoots fire and strikes you dead
what d'ye meana gun
no sir and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the heatray
halfway through the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me
i was still standing on the bank by the side of the road
it's perfectly true i said
well said the lieutenant i suppose it's my business to see it too
look hereto the artillerymanwe're detailed here clearing people out of their houses
you'd better go along and report yourself to brigadiergeneral marvin and tell him all you know
he's at weybridge
know the way
i do i said and he turned his horse southward again
half a mile you say
said he
at most i answered and pointed over the treetops southward
he thanked me and rode on and we saw them no more
farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in the road busy clearing out a labourer's cottage
they had got hold of a little hand truck and were piling it up with uncleanlooking bundles and shabby furniture
they were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed
by byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees and found the country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight
we were far beyond the range of the heatray there and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the houses the stirring movement of packing in others and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towards woking the day would have seemed very like any other sunday
several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to addlestone and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw across a stretch of flat meadow six twelvepounders standing neatly at equal distances pointing towards woking
the gunners stood by the guns waiting and the ammunition waggons were at a businesslike distance
the men stood almost as if under inspection
that's good
said i
they will get one fair shot at any rate
the artilleryman hesitated at the gate
i shall go on he said
farther on towards weybridge just over the bridge there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart and more guns behind
it's bows and arrows against the lightning anyhow said the artilleryman
they 'aven't seen that firebeam yet
the officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetops southwestward and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction
byfleet was in a tumult people packing and a score of hussars some of them dismounted some on horseback were hunting them about
three or four black government waggons with crosses in white circles and an old omnibus among other vehicles were being loaded in the village street
there were scores of people most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes
the soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position
we saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind
i stopped and gripped his arm
do you know what's over there
i said pointing at the pine tops that hid the martians
eh
said he turning
i was explainin' these is vallyble
death
i shouted
death is coming
death
and leaving him to digest that if he could i hurried on after the artilleryman
at the corner i looked back
the soldier had left him and he was still standing by his box with the pots of orchids on the lid of it and staring vaguely over the trees
no one in weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were established the whole place was in such confusion as i had never seen in any town before
carts carriages everywhere the most astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh
the respectable inhabitants of the place men in golf and boating costumes wives prettily dressed were packing riverside loafers energetically helping children excited and for the most part highly delighted at this astonishing variation of their sunday experiences
in the midst of it all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration and his bell was jangling out above the excitement
i and the artilleryman seated on the step of the drinking fountain made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us
patrols of soldiershere no longer hussars but grenadiers in whitewere warning people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began
we saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages
the ordinary traffic had been stopped i believe in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to chertsey and i have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour
we remained at weybridge until midday and at that hour we found ourselves at the place near shepperton lock where the wey and thames join
part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little cart
the wey has a treble mouth and at this point boats are to be hired and there was a ferry across the river
on the shepperton side was an inn with a lawn and beyond that the tower of shepperton churchit has been replaced by a spirerose above the trees
here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives
as yet the flight had not grown to a panic but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross
people came panting along under heavy burdens one husband and wife were even carrying a small outhouse door between them with some of their household goods piled thereon
one man told us he meant to try to get away from shepperton station
there was a lot of shouting and one man was even jesting
the idea people seemed to have here was that the martians were simply formidable human beings who might attack and sack the town to be certainly destroyed in the end
every now and then people would glance nervously across the wey at the meadows towards chertsey but everything over there was still
across the thames except just where the boats landed everything was quiet in vivid contrast with the surrey side
the people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane
the big ferryboat had just made a journey
three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn staring and jesting at the fugitives without offering to help
the inn was closed as it was now within prohibited hours
what's that
cried a boatman and shut up you fool
said a man near me to a yelping dog
then the sound came again this time from the direction of chertsey a muffled thudthe sound of a gun
the fighting was beginning
almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right unseen because of the trees took up the chorus firing heavily one after the other
a woman screamed
everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle near us and yet invisible to us
nothing was to be seen save flat meadows cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part and silvery pollard willows motionless in the warm sunlight
the sojers'll stop 'em said a woman beside me doubtfully
a haziness rose over the treetops
then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air smashing two or three windows in the houses near and leaving us astonished
here they are
shouted a man in a blue jersey
yonder
d'yer see them
yonder
quickly one after the other one two three four of the armoured martians appeared far away over the little trees across the flat meadows that stretched towards chertsey and striding hurriedly towards the river
little cowled figures they seemed at first going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds
then advancing obliquely towards us came a fifth
their armoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer
one on the extreme left the remotest that is flourished a huge case high in the air and the ghostly terrible heatray i had already seen on friday night smote towards chertsey and struck the town
at sight of these strange swift and terrible creatures the crowd near the water's edge seemed to me to be for a moment horrorstruck
there was no screaming or shouting but a silence
then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feeta splashing from the water
a man too frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden
a woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me
i turned with the rush of the people but i was not too terrified for thought
the terrible heatray was in my mind
to get under water
that was it
get under water
i shouted unheeded
i faced about again and rushed towards the approaching martian rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water
others did the same
a boatload of people putting back came leaping out as i rushed past
the stones under my feet were muddy and slippery and the river was so low that i ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waistdeep
then as the martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards away i flung myself forward under the surface
the splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears
people were landing hastily on both sides of the river
but the martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked
when half suffocated i raised my head above water the martian's hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river and as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the heatray
in another moment it was on the bank and in a stride wading halfway across
the knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again close to the village of shepperton
forthwith the six guns which unknown to anyone on the right bank had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village fired simultaneously
the sudden near concussion the last close upon the first made my heart jump
the monster was already raising the case generating the heatray as the first shell burst six yards above the hood
i gave a cry of astonishment
i saw and thought nothing of the other four martian monsters my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident
simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive but not in time to dodge the fourth shell
the shell burst clean in the face of the thing
the hood bulged flashed was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal
hit
shouted i with something between a scream and a cheer
i heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me
i could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation
the decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant but it did not fall over
it recovered its balance by a miracle and no longer heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the heatray now rigidly upheld it reeled swiftly upon shepperton
the living intelligence the martian within the hood was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven and the thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling to destruction
it drove along in a straight line incapable of guidance
it struck the tower of shepperton church smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done swerved aside blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into the river out of my sight
a violent explosion shook the air and a spout of water steam mud and shattered metal shot far up into the sky
as the camera of the heatray hit the water the latter had immediately flashed into steam
in another moment a huge wave like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot came sweeping round the bend upstream
i saw people struggling shorewards and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of the martian's collapse
for a moment i heeded nothing of the heat forgot the patent need of selfpreservation
i splashed through the tumultuous water pushing aside a man in black to do so until i could see round the bend
half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves
the fallen martian came into sight downstream lying across the river and for the most part submerged
thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage and through the tumultuously whirling wisps i could see intermittently and vaguely the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray of mud and froth into the air
the tentacles swayed and struck like living arms and save for the helpless purposelessness of these movements it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life amid the waves
enormous quantities of a ruddybrown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine
my attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns
a man kneedeep near the towing path shouted inaudibly to me and pointed
looking back i saw the other martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of chertsey
the shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly
at that i ducked at once under water and holding my breath until movement was an agony blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as i could
the water was in a tumult about me and rapidly growing hotter
when for a moment i raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid the martians altogether
the noise was deafening
then i saw them dimly colossal figures of grey magnified by the mist
they had passed by me and two were stooping over the frothing tumultuous ruins of their comrade
the third and fourth stood beside him in the water one perhaps two hundred yards from me the other towards laleham
the generators of the heatrays waved high and the hissing beams smote down this way and that
the air was full of sound a deafening and confusing conflict of noisesthe clangorous din of the martians the crash of falling houses the thud of trees fences sheds flashing into flame and the crackling and roaring of fire
dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river and as the heatray went to and fro over weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames
the nearer houses still stood intact awaiting their fate shadowy faint and pallid in the steam with the fire behind them going to and fro
for a moment perhaps i stood there breasthigh in the almost boiling water dumbfounded at my position hopeless of escape
through the reek i could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds like little frogs hurrying through grass from the advance of a man or running to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path
then suddenly the white flashes of the heatray came leaping towards me
the houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch and darted out flames the trees changed to fire with a roar
the ray flickered up and down the towing path licking off the people who ran this way and that and came down to the water's edge not fifty yards from where i stood
it swept across the river to shepperton and the water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam
i turned shoreward
in another moment the huge wave wellnigh at the boilingpoint had rushed upon me
i screamed aloud and scalded half blinded agonised i staggered through the leaping hissing water towards the shore
had my foot stumbled it would have been the end
i fell helplessly in full sight of the martians upon the broad bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the wey and thames
i expected nothing but death
i have a dim memory of the foot of a martian coming down within a score of yards of my head driving straight into the loose gravel whirling it this way and that and lifting again of a long suspense and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke receding interminably as it seemed to me across a vast space of river and meadow
and then very slowly i realised that by a miracle i had escaped
chapter thirteen  how i fell in with the curate   after getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons the martians retreated to their original position upon horsell common and in their haste and encumbered with the debris of their smashed companion they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself
had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith there was nothing at that time between them and london but batteries of twelvepounder guns and they would certainly have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach as sudden dreadful and destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that destroyed lisbon a century ago
but they were in no hurry
cylinder followed cylinder on its interplanetary flight every twentyfour hours brought them reinforcement
and meanwhile the military and naval authorities now fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists worked with furious energy
every minute a fresh gun came into position until before twilight every copse every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about kingston and richmond masked an expectant black muzzle
and through the charred and desolated areaperhaps twenty square miles altogetherthat encircled the martian encampment on horsell common through charred and ruined villages among the green trees through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the martian approach
but the martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human proximity and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder save at the price of his life
it would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in going to and fro transferring everything from the second and third cylindersthe second in addlestone golf links and the third at pyrfordto their original pit on horsell common
over that above the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide stood one as sentinel while the rest abandoned their vast fightingmachines and descended into the pit
they were hard at work there far into the night and the towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about merrow and even it is said from banstead and epsom downs
and while the martians behind me were thus preparing for their next sally and in front of me humanity gathered for the battle i made my way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning weybridge towards london
i saw an abandoned boat very small and remote drifting downstream and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes i went after it gained it and so escaped out of that destruction
there were no oars in the boat but i contrived to paddle as well as my parboiled hands would allow down the river towards halliford and walton going very tediously and continually looking behind me as you may well understand
i followed the river because i considered that the water gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return
the hot water from the martian's overthrow drifted downstream with me so that for the best part of a mile i could see little of either bank
once however i made out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of weybridge
halliford it seemed was deserted and several of the houses facing the river were on fire
it was strange to see the place quite tranquil quite desolate under the hot blue sky with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon
never before had i seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd
a little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay
for a long time i drifted so painful and weary was i after the violence i had been through and so intense the heat upon the water
then my fears got the better of me again and i resumed my paddling
the sun scorched my bare back
at last as the bridge at walton was coming into sight round the bend my fever and faintness overcame my fears and i landed on the middlesex bank and lay down deadly sick amid the long grass
i suppose the time was then about four or five o'clock
i got up presently walked perhaps half a mile without meeting a soul and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge
i seem to remember talking wanderingly to myself during that last spurt
i was also very thirsty and bitterly regretful i had drunk no more water
it is a curious thing that i felt angry with my wife i cannot account for it but my impotent desire to reach leatherhead worried me excessively
i do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate so that probably i dozed
i became aware of him as a seated figure in sootsmudged shirt sleeves and with his upturned cleanshaven face staring at a faint flickering that danced over the sky
the sky was what is called a mackerel skyrows and rows of faint downplumes of cloud just tinted with the midsummer sunset
i sat up and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly
have you any water
i asked abruptly
he shook his head
you have been asking for water for the last hour he said
for a moment we were silent taking stock of each other
i dare say he found me a strange enough figure naked save for my watersoaked trousers and socks scalded and my face and shoulders blackened by the smoke
his face was a fair weakness his chin retreated and his hair lay in crisp almost flaxen curls on his low forehead his eyes were rather large pale blue and blankly staring
he spoke abruptly looking vacantly away from me
what does it mean
he said
what do these things mean
i stared at him and made no answer
he extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone
why are these things permitted
what sins have we done
the morning service was over i was walking through the roads to clear my brain for the afternoon and thenfire earthquake death
as if it were sodom and gomorrah
all our work undone all the work what are these martians
what are we
i answered clearing my throat
he gripped his knees and turned to look at me again
for half a minute perhaps he stared silently
i was walking through the roads to clear my brain he said
and suddenlyfire earthquake death
he relapsed into silence with his chin now sunken almost to his knees
presently he began waving his hand
all the workall the sunday schoolswhat have we donewhat has weybridge done
everything goneeverything destroyed
the church
we rebuilt it only three years ago
gone
swept out of existence
why
another pause and he broke out again like one demented
the smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever
he shouted
his eyes flamed and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of weybridge
by this time i was beginning to take his measure
the tremendous tragedy in which he had been involvedit was evident he was a fugitive from weybridgehad driven him to the very verge of his reason
are we far from sunbury
i said in a matteroffact tone
what are we to do
he asked
are these creatures everywhere
has the earth been given over to them
are we far from sunbury
only this morning i officiated at early celebration  things have changed i said quietly
you must keep your head
there is still hope
hope
yes
plentiful hopefor all this destruction
i began to explain my view of our position
he listened at first but as i went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their former stare and his regard wandered from me
this must be the beginning of the end he said interrupting me
the end
the great and terrible day of the lord
when men shall call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide themhide them from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne
i began to understand the position
i ceased my laboured reasoning struggled to my feet and standing over him laid my hand on his shoulder
be a man
said i
you are scared out of your wits
what good is religion if it collapses under calamity
think of what earthquakes and floods wars and volcanoes have done before to men
did you think god had exempted weybridge
he is not an insurance agent
for a time he sat in blank silence
but how can we escape
he asked suddenly
they are invulnerable they are pitiless
neither the one nor perhaps the other i answered
and the mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be
one of them was killed yonder not three hours ago
killed
he said staring about him
how can god's ministers be killed
i saw it happen
i proceeded to tell him
we have chanced to come in for the thick of it said i and that is all
what is that flicker in the sky
he asked abruptly
i told him it was the heliograph signallingthat it was the sign of human help and effort in the sky
we are in the midst of it i said quiet as it is
that flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm
yonder i take it are the martians and londonward where those hills rise about richmond and kingston and the trees give cover earthworks are being thrown up and guns are being placed
presently the martians will be coming this way again
and even as i spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture
listen
he said
from beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of distant guns and a remote weird crying
then everything was still
a cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us
high in the west the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of weybridge and shepperton and the hot still splendour of the sunset
we had better follow this path i said northward
chapter fourteen  in london   my younger brother was in london when the martians fell at woking
he was a medical student working for an imminent examination and he heard nothing of the arrival until saturday morning
the morning papers on saturday contained in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet mars on life in the planets and so forth a brief and vaguely worded telegram all the more striking for its brevity
the martians alarmed by the approach of a crowd had killed a number of people with a quickfiring gun so the story ran
the telegram concluded with the words formidable as they seem to be the martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen and indeed seem incapable of doing so
probably this is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy
on that last text their leaderwriter expanded very comfortingly
of course all the students in the crammer's biology class to which my brother went that day were intensely interested but there were no signs of any unusual excitement in the streets
the afternoon papers puffed scraps of news under big headlines
they had nothing to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common and the burning of the pine woods between woking and weybridge until eight
then the st
james's gazette in an extraspecial edition announced the bare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication
this was thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line
nothing more of the fighting was known that night the night of my drive to leatherhead and back
my brother felt no anxiety about us as he knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house
he made up his mind to run down that night to me in order as he says to see the things before they were killed
he dispatched a telegram which never reached me about four o'clock and spent the evening at a music hall
in london also on saturday night there was a thunderstorm and my brother reached waterloo in a cab
on the platform from which the midnight train usually starts he learned after some waiting that an accident prevented trains from reaching woking that night
the nature of the accident he could not ascertain indeed the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time
there was very little excitement in the station as the officials failing to realise that anything further than a breakdown between byfleet and woking junction had occurred were running the theatre trains which usually passed through woking round by virginia water or guildford
they were busy making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the southampton and portsmouth sunday league excursions
a nocturnal newspaper reporter mistaking my brother for the traffic manager to whom he bears a slight resemblance waylaid and tried to interview him
few people excepting the railway officials connected the breakdown with the martians
i have read in another account of these events that on sunday morning all london was electrified by the news from woking
as a matter of fact there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase
plenty of londoners did not hear of the martians until the panic of monday morning
those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily worded telegrams in the sunday papers conveyed
the majority of people in london do not read sunday papers
the habit of personal security moreover is so deeply fixed in the londoner's mind and startling intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers that they could read without any personal tremors about seven o'clock last night the martians came out of the cylinder and moving about under an armour of metallic shields have completely wrecked woking station with the adjacent houses and massacred an entire battalion of the cardigan regiment
no details are known
maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour the field guns have been disabled by them
flying hussars have been galloping into chertsey
the martians appear to be moving slowly towards chertsey or windsor
great anxiety prevails in west surrey and earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance londonward
that was how the sunday sun put it and a clever and remarkably prompt handbook article in the referee compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village
no one in london knew positively of the nature of the armoured martians and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish crawling creeping painfullysuch expressions occurred in almost all the earlier reports
none of the telegrams could have been written by an eyewitness of their advance
the sunday papers printed separate editions as further news came to hand some even in default of it
but there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in the afternoon when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in their possession
it was stated that the people of walton and weybridge and all the district were pouring along the roads londonward and that was all
my brother went to church at the foundling hospital in the morning still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night
there he heard allusions made to the invasion and a special prayer for peace
coming out he bought a referee
he became alarmed at the news in this and went again to waterloo station to find out if communication were restored
the omnibuses carriages cyclists and innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the strange intelligence that the news venders were disseminating
people were interested or if alarmed alarmed only on account of the local residents
at the station he heard for the first time that the windsor and chertsey lines were now interrupted
the porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from byfleet and chertsey stations but that these had abruptly ceased
my brother could get very little precise detail out of them
there's fighting going on about weybridge was the extent of their information
the train service was now very much disorganised
quite a number of people who had been expecting friends from places on the southwestern network were standing about the station
one greyheaded old gentleman came and abused the southwestern company bitterly to my brother
it wants showing up he said
one or two trains came in from richmond putney and kingston containing people who had gone out for a day's boating and found the locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air
a man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother full of strange tidings
there's hosts of people driving into kingston in traps and carts and things with boxes of valuables and all that he said
they come from molesey and weybridge and walton and they say there's been guns heard at chertsey heavy firing and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because the martians are coming
we heard guns firing at hampton court station but we thought it was thunder
what the dickens does it all mean
the martians can't get out of their pit can they
my brother could not tell him
afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the clients of the underground railway and that the sunday excursionists began to return from all over the southwestern lungbarnes wimbledon richmond park kew and so forthat unnaturally early hours but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of
everyone connected with the terminus seemed illtempered
about five o'clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited by the opening of the line of communication which is almost invariably closed between the southeastern and the southwestern stations and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed with soldiers
these were the guns that were brought up from woolwich and chatham to cover kingston
there was an exchange of pleasantries you'll get eaten
we're the beasttamers
and so forth
a little while after that a squad of police came into the station and began to clear the public off the platforms and my brother went out into the street again
the church bells were ringing for evensong and a squad of salvation army lassies came singing down waterloo road
on the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream in patches
the sun was just setting and the clock tower and the houses of parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine a sky of gold barred with long transverse stripes of reddishpurple cloud
there was talk of a floating body
one of the men there a reservist he said he was told my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west
in wellington street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had just been rushed out of fleet street with stillwet newspapers and staring placards
dreadful catastrophe
they bawled one to the other down wellington street
fighting at weybridge
full description
repulse of the martians
london in danger
he had to give threepence for a copy of that paper
then it was and then only that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters
he learned that they were not merely a handful of small sluggish creatures but that they were minds swaying vast mechanical bodies and that they could move swiftly and smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand against them
they were described as vast spiderlike machines nearly a hundred feet high capable of the speed of an express train and able to shoot out a beam of intense heat
masked batteries chiefly of field guns had been planted in the country about horsell common and especially between the woking district and london
five of the machines had been seen moving towards the thames and one by a happy chance had been destroyed
in the other cases the shells had missed and the batteries had been at once annihilated by the heatrays
heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic
the martians had been repulsed they were not invulnerable
they had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again in the circle about woking
signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from all sides
guns were in rapid transit from windsor portsmouth aldershot woolwicheven from the north among others long wireguns of ninetyfive tons from woolwich
altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed chiefly covering london
never before in england had there been such a vast or rapid concentration of military material
any further cylinders that fell it was hoped could be destroyed at once by high explosives which were being rapidly manufactured and distributed
no doubt ran the report the situation was of the strangest and gravest description but the public was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic
no doubt the martians were strange and terrible in the extreme but at the outside there could not be more than twenty of them against our millions
the authorities had reason to suppose from the size of the cylinders that at the outside there could not be more than five in each cylinderfifteen altogether
and one at least was disposed ofperhaps more
the public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs
and so with reiterated assurances of the safety of london and the ability of the authorities to cope with the difficulty this quasiproclamation closed
this was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still wet and there had been no time to add a word of comment
it was curious my brother said to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place
all down wellington street people could be seen fluttering out the pink sheets and reading and the strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers
men came scrambling off buses to secure copies
certainly this news excited people intensely whatever their previous apathy
the shutters of a map shop in the strand were being taken down my brother said and a man in his sunday raiment lemonyellow gloves even was visible inside the window hastily fastening maps of surrey to the glass
going on along the strand to trafalgar square the paper in his hand my brother saw some of the fugitives from west surrey
there was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use
he was driving from the direction of westminster bridge and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or six respectablelooking people in it and some boxes and bundles
the faces of these people were haggard and their entire appearance contrasted conspicuously with the sabbathbest appearance of the people on the omnibuses
people in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs
they stopped at the square as if undecided which way to take and finally turned eastward along the strand
some way behind these came a man in workday clothes riding one of those oldfashioned tricycles with a small front wheel
he was dirty and white in the face
my brother turned down towards victoria and met a number of such people
he had a vague idea that he might see something of me
he noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic
some of the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses
one was professing to have seen the martians
boilers on stilts i tell you striding along like men
most of them were excited and animated by their strange experience
beyond victoria the publichouses were doing a lively trade with these arrivals
at all the street corners groups of people were reading papers talking excitedly or staring at these unusual sunday visitors
they seemed to increase as night drew on until at last the roads my brother said were like epsom high street on a derby day
my brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from most
none of them could tell him any news of woking except one man who assured him that woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night
i come from byfleet he said man on a bicycle came through the place in the early morning and ran from door to door warning us to come away
then came soldiers
we went out to look and there were clouds of smoke to the southnothing but smoke and not a soul coming that way
then we heard the guns at chertsey and folks coming from weybridge
so i've locked up my house and come on
at the time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience
about eight o'clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all over the south of london
my brother could not hear it for the traffic in the main thoroughfares but by striking through the quiet back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly
he walked from westminster to his apartments near regent's park about two
he was now very anxious on my account and disturbed at the evident magnitude of the trouble
his mind was inclined to run even as mine had run on saturday on military details
he thought of all those silent expectant guns of the suddenly nomadic countryside he tried to imagine boilers on stilts a hundred feet high
there were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along oxford street and several in the marylebone road but so slowly was the news spreading that regent street and portland place were full of their usual sundaynight promenaders albeit they talked in groups and along the edge of regent's park there were as many silent couples walking out together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been
the night was warm and still and a little oppressive the sound of guns continued intermittently and after midnight there seemed to be sheet lightning in the south
he read and reread the paper fearing the worst had happened to me
he was restless and after supper prowled out again aimlessly
he returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes
he went to bed a little after midnight and was awakened from lurid dreams in the small hours of monday by the sound of door knockers feet running in the street distant drumming and a clamour of bells
red reflections danced on the ceiling
for a moment he lay astonished wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad
then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window
his room was an attic and as he thrust his head out up and down the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared
enquiries were being shouted
they are coming
bawled a policeman hammering at the door the martians are coming
and hurried to the next door
the sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the albany street barracks and every church within earshot was hard at work killing sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin
there was a noise of doors opening and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination
up the street came galloping a closed carriage bursting abruptly into noise at the corner rising to a clattering climax under the window and dying away slowly in the distance
close on the rear of this came a couple of cabs the forerunners of a long procession of flying vehicles going for the most part to chalk farm station where the northwestern special trains were loading up instead of coming down the gradient into euston
for a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank astonishment watching the policemen hammering at door after door and delivering their incomprehensible message
then the door behind him opened and the man who lodged across the landing came in dressed only in shirt trousers and slippers his braces loose about his waist his hair disordered from his pillow
what the devil is it
he asked
a fire
what a devil of a row
they both craned their heads out of the window straining to hear what the policemen were shouting
people were coming out of the side streets and standing in groups at the corners talking
what the devil is it all about
said my brother's fellow lodger
my brother answered him vaguely and began to dress running with each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing excitement
and presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into the street  london in danger of suffocation
the kingston and richmond defences forced
fearful massacres in the thames valley
and all about himin the rooms below in the houses on each side and across the road and behind in the park terraces and in the hundred other streets of that part of marylebone and the westbourne park district and st pancras and westward and northward in kilburn and st john's wood and hampstead and eastward in shoreditch and highbury and haggerston and hoxton and indeed through all the vastness of london from ealing to east hampeople were rubbing their eyes and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of fear blew through the streets
it was the dawn of the great panic
london which had gone to bed on sunday night oblivious and inert was awakened in the small hours of monday morning to a vivid sense of danger
unable from his window to learn what was happening my brother went down and out into the street just as the sky between the parapets of the houses grew pink with the early dawn
the flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment
black smoke
he heard people crying and again black smoke
the contagion of such a unanimous fear was inevitable
as my brother hesitated on the doorstep he saw another news vender approaching and got a paper forthwith
the man was running away with the rest and selling his papers for a shilling each as he rana grotesque mingling of profit and panic
and from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the commanderinchief  the martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonous vapour by means of rockets
they have smothered our batteries destroyed richmond kingston and wimbledon and are advancing slowly towards london destroying everything on the way
it is impossible to stop them
there is no safety from the black smoke but in instant flight
that was all but it was enough
the whole population of the great sixmillion city was stirring slipping running presently it would be pouring en masse northward
black smoke
the voices cried
fire
the bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult a cart carelessly driven smashed amid shrieks and curses against the water trough up the street
sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps
and overhead the dawn was growing brighter clear and steady and calm
he heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms and up and down stairs behind him
his landlady came to the door loosely wrapped in dressing gown and shawl her husband followed ejaculating
as my brother began to realise the import of all these things he turned hastily to his own room put all his available moneysome ten pounds altogetherinto his pockets and went out again into the streets
chapter fifteen  what had happened in surrey   it was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge in the flat meadows near halliford and while my brother was watching the fugitives stream over westminster bridge that the martians had resumed the offensive
so far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put forth the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the horsell pit until nine that night hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green smoke
but three certainly came out about eight o'clock and advancing slowly and cautiously made their way through byfleet and pyrford towards ripley and weybridge and so came in sight of the expectant batteries against the setting sun
these martians did not advance in a body but in a line each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow
they communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls running up and down the scale from one note to another
it was this howling and firing of the guns at ripley and st george's hill that we had heard at upper halliford
the ripley gunners unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in such a position fired one wild premature ineffectual volley and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village while the martian without using his heatray walked serenely over their guns stepped gingerly among them passed in front of them and so came unexpectedly upon the guns in painshill park which he destroyed
the st george's hill men however were better led or of a better mettle
hidden by a pine wood as they were they seem to have been quite unsuspected by the martian nearest to them
they laid their guns as deliberately as if they had been on parade and fired at about a thousand yards' range
the shells flashed all round him and he was seen to advance a few paces stagger and go down
everybody yelled together and the guns were reloaded in frantic haste
the overthrown martian set up a prolonged ululation and immediately a second glittering giant answering him appeared over the trees to the south
it would seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells
the whole of the second volley flew wide of the martian on the ground and simultaneously both his companions brought their heatrays to bear on the battery
the ammunition blew up the pine trees all about the guns flashed into fire and only one or two of the men who were already running over the crest of the hill escaped
after this it would seem that the three took counsel together and halted and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour
the martian who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood a small brown figure oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight and apparently engaged in the repair of his support
about nine he had finished for his cowl was then seen above the trees again
it was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other martians each carrying a thick black tube
a similar tube was handed to each of the three and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between st george's hill weybridge and the village of send southwest of ripley
a dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they began to move and warned the waiting batteries about ditton and esher
at the same time four of their fighting machines similarly armed with tubes crossed the river and two of them black against the western sky came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out of halliford
they moved as it seemed to us upon a cloud for a milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height
at this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat and began running but i knew it was no good running from a martian and i turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch by the side of the road
he looked back saw what i was doing and turned to join me
the two halted the nearer to us standing and facing sunbury the remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star away towards staines
the occasional howling of the martians had ceased they took up their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence
it was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns
never since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still
to us and to an observer about ripley it would have had precisely the same effectthe martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling night lit only as it was by the slender moon the stars the afterglow of the daylight and the ruddy glare from st george's hill and the woods of painshill
but facing that crescent everywhereat staines hounslow ditton esher ockham behind hills and woods south of the river and across the flat grass meadows to the north of it wherever a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient coverthe guns were waiting
the signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and vanished and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a tense expectation
the martians had but to advance into the line of fire and instantly those motionless black forms of men those guns glittering so darkly in the early night would explode into a thunderous fury of battle
no doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant minds even as it was uppermost in mine was the riddlehow much they understood of us
did they grasp that we in our millions were organized disciplined working together
or did they interpret our spurts of fire the sudden stinging of our shells our steady investment of their encampment as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees
did they dream they might exterminate us
at that time no one knew what food they needed
a hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as i watched that vast sentinel shape
and in the back of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown and hidden forces londonward
had they prepared pitfalls
were the powder mills at hounslow ready as a snare
would the londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater moscow of their mighty province of houses
then after an interminable time as it seemed to us crouching and peering through the hedge came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun
another nearer and then another
and then the martian beside us raised his tube on high and discharged it gunwise with a heavy report that made the ground heave
the one towards staines answered him
there was no flash no smoke simply that loaded detonation
i was so excited by these heavy minuteguns following one another that i so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards sunbury
as i did so a second report followed and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards hounslow
i expected at least to see smoke or fire or some such evidence of its work
but all i saw was the deep blue sky above with one solitary star and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath
and there had been no crash no answering explosion
the silence was restored the minute lengthened to three
what has happened
said the curate standing up beside me
heaven knows
said i
a bat flickered by and vanished
a distant tumult of shouting began and ceased
i looked again at the martian and saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank with a swift rolling motion
every moment i expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon him but the evening calm was unbroken
the figure of the martian grew smaller as he receded and presently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up
by a common impulse we clambered higher
towards sunbury was a dark appearance as though a conical hill had suddenly come into being there hiding our view of the farther country and then remoter across the river over walton we saw another such summit
these hilllike forms grew lower and broader even as we stared
moved by a sudden thought i looked northward and there i perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen
everything had suddenly become very still
far away to the southeast marking the quiet we heard the martians hooting to one another and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns
but the earthly artillery made no reply
now at the time we could not understand these things but later i was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight
each of the martians standing in the great crescent i have described had discharged by means of the gunlike tube he carried a huge canister over whatever hill copse cluster of houses or other possible cover for guns chanced to be in front of him
some fired only one of these some twoas in the case of the one we had seen the one at ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time
these canisters smashed on striking the groundthey did not explodeand incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy inky vapour coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country
and the touch of that vapour the inhaling of its pungent wisps was death to all that breathes
it was heavy this vapour heavier than the densest smoke so that after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact it sank down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous abandoning the hills and streaming into the valleys and ditches and watercourses even as i have heard the carbonicacid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do
and where it came upon water some chemical action occurred and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way for more
the scum was absolutely insoluble and it is a strange thing seeing the instant effect of the gas that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained
the vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do
it hung together in banks flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly before the wind and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air and sank to the earth in the form of dust
save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance
once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over the black smoke clung so closely to the ground even before its precipitation that fifty feet up in the air on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees there was a chance of escaping its poison altogether as was proved even that night at street cobham and ditton
the man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the strangeness of its coiling flow and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness
for a day and a half he remained there weary starving and sunscorched the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant hills a velvetblack expanse with red roofs green trees and later blackveiled shrubs and gates barns outhouses and walls rising here and there into the sunlight
but that was at street cobham where the black vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground
as a rule the martians when it had served its purpose cleared the air of it again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it
this they did with the vapour banks near us as we saw in the starlight from the window of a deserted house at upper halliford whither we had returned
from there we could see the searchlights on richmond hill and kingston hill going to and fro and about eleven the windows rattled and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in position there
these continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour sending chance shots at the invisible martians at hampton and ditton and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished and were replaced by a bright red glow
then the fourth cylinder fella brilliant green meteoras i learned afterwards in bushey park
before the guns on the richmond and kingston line of hills began there was a fitful cannonade far away in the southwest due i believe to guns being fired haphazard before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners
so setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps' nest the martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the londonward country
the horns of the crescent slowly moved apart until at last they formed a line from hanwell to coombe and malden
all night through their destructive tubes advanced
never once after the martian at st george's hill was brought down did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance against them
wherever there was a possibility of guns being laid for them unseen a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged and where the guns were openly displayed the heatray was brought to bear
by midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of richmond park and the glare of kingston hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke blotting out the whole valley of the thames and extending as far as the eye could reach
and through this two martians slowly waded and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that
they were sparing of the heatray that night either because they had but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the opposition they had aroused
in the latter aim they certainly succeeded
sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to their movements
after that no body of men would stand against them so hopeless was the enterprise
even the crews of the torpedoboats and destroyers that had brought their quickfirers up the thames refused to stop mutinied and went down again
the only offensive operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and pitfalls and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic
one has to imagine as well as one may the fate of those batteries towards esher waiting so tensely in the twilight
survivors there were none
one may picture the orderly expectation the officers alert and watchful the gunners ready the ammunition piled to hand the limber gunners with their horses and waggons the groups of civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted the evening stillness the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and wounded from weybridge then the dull resonance of the shots the martians fired and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields
one may picture too the sudden shifting of the attention the swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong towering heavenward turning the twilight to a palpable darkness a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims men and horses near it seen dimly running shrieking falling headlong shouts of dismay the guns suddenly abandoned men choking and writhing on the ground and the swift broadeningout of the opaque cone of smoke
and then night and extinctionnothing but a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead
before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of richmond and the disintegrating organism of government was with a last expiring effort rousing the population of london to the necessity of flight
chapter sixteen  the exodus from london   so you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as monday was dawningthe stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent lashing in a foaming tumult round the railway stations banked up into a horrible struggle about the shipping in the thames and hurrying by every available channel northward and eastward
by ten o'clock the police organisation and by midday even the railway organisations were losing coherency losing shape and efficiency guttering softening running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body
all the railway lines north of the thames and the southeastern people at cannon street had been warned by midnight on sunday and trains were being filled
people were fighting savagely for standingroom in the carriages even at two o'clock
by three people were being trampled and crushed even in bishopsgate street a couple of hundred yards or more from liverpool street station revolvers were fired people stabbed and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic exhausted and infuriated were breaking the heads of the people they were called out to protect
and as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to london the pressure of the flight drove the people in an everthickening multitude away from the stations and along the northwardrunning roads
by midday a martian had been seen at barnes and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the thames and across the flats of lambeth cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance
another bank drove over ealing and surrounded a little island of survivors on castle hill alive but unable to escape
after a fruitless struggle to get aboard a northwestern train at chalk farmthe engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there ploughed through shrieking people and a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnacemy brother emerged upon the chalk farm road dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop
the front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window but he got up and off notwithstanding with no further injury than a cut wrist
the steep foot of haverstock hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses and my brother struck into belsize road
so he got out of the fury of the panic and skirting the edgware road reached edgware about seven fasting and wearied but well ahead of the crowd
along the road people were standing in the roadway curious wondering
he was passed by a number of cyclists some horsemen and two motor cars
a mile from edgware the rim of the wheel broke and the machine became unridable
he left it by the roadside and trudged through the village
there were shops half opened in the main street of the place and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and windows staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning
he succeeded in getting some food at an inn
for a time he remained in edgware not knowing what next to do
the flying people increased in number
many of them like my brother seemed inclined to loiter in the place
there was no fresh news of the invaders from mars
at that time the road was crowded but as yet far from congested
most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles but there were soon motor cars hansom cabs and carriages hurrying along and the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to st albans
it was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to chelmsford where some friends of his lived that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward
presently he came upon a stile and crossing it followed a footpath northeastward
he passed near several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn
he saw few fugitives until in a grass lane towards high barnet he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers
he came upon them just in time to save them
he heard their screams and hurrying round the corner saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little ponychaise in which they had been driving while a third with difficulty held the frightened pony's head
one of the ladies a short woman dressed in white was simply screaming the other a dark slender figure slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand
my brother immediately grasped the situation shouted and hurried towards the struggle
one of the men desisted and turned towards him and my brother realising from his antagonist's face that a fight was unavoidable and being an expert boxer went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise
it was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender lady's arm
he heard the clatter of hoofs the whip stung across his face a third antagonist struck him between the eyes and the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come
partly stunned he found himself facing the man who had held the horse's head and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane swaying from side to side and with the women in it looking back
the man before him a burly rough tried to close and he stopped him with a blow in the face
then realising that he was deserted he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise with the sturdy man close behind him and the fugitive who had turned now following remotely
suddenly he stumbled and fell his immediate pursuer went headlong and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again
he would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help
it seems she had had a revolver all this time but it had been under the seat when she and her companion were attacked
she fired at six yards' distance narrowly missing my brother
the less courageous of the robbers made off and his companion followed him cursing his cowardice
they both stopped in sight down the lane where the third man lay insensible
take this
said the slender lady and she gave my brother her revolver
go back to the chaise said my brother wiping the blood from his split lip
she turned without a wordthey were both pantingand they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony
the robbers had evidently had enough of it
when my brother looked again they were retreating
i'll sit here said my brother if i may and he got upon the empty front seat
the lady looked over her shoulder
give me the reins she said and laid the whip along the pony's side
in another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my brother's eyes
so quite unexpectedly my brother found himself panting with a cut mouth a bruised jaw and bloodstained knuckles driving along an unknown lane with these two women
he learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon living at stanmore who had come in the small hours from a dangerous case at pinner and heard at some railway station on his way of the martian advance
he had hurried home roused the womentheir servant had left them two days beforepacked some provisions put his revolver under the seatluckily for my brotherand told them to drive on to edgware with the idea of getting a train there
he stopped behind to tell the neighbours
he would overtake them he said at about half past four in the morning and now it was nearly nine and they had seen nothing of him
they could not stop in edgware because of the growing traffic through the place and so they had come into this side lane
that was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently they stopped again nearer to new barnet
he promised to stay with them at least until they could determine what to do or until the missing man arrived and professed to be an expert shot with the revolvera weapon strange to himin order to give them confidence
they made a sort of encampment by the wayside and the pony became happy in the hedge
he told them of his own escape out of london and all that he knew of these martians and their ways
the sun crept higher in the sky and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state of anticipation
several wayfarers came along the lane and of these my brother gathered such news as he could
every broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had come on humanity deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity for prosecuting this flight
he urged the matter upon them
we have money said the slender woman and hesitated
her eyes met my brother's and her hesitation ended
so have i said my brother
she explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold besides a fivepound note and suggested that with that they might get upon a train at st albans or new barnet
my brother thought that was hopeless seeing the fury of the londoners to crowd upon the trains and broached his own idea of striking across essex towards harwich and thence escaping from the country altogether
mrs elphinstonethat was the name of the woman in whitewould listen to no reasoning and kept calling upon george but her sisterinlaw was astonishingly quiet and deliberate and at last agreed to my brother's suggestion
so designing to cross the great north road they went on towards barnet my brother leading the pony to save it as much as possible
as the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively hot and under foot a thick whitish sand grew burning and blinding so that they travelled only very slowly
the hedges were grey with dust
and as they advanced towards barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew stronger
they began to meet more people
for the most part these were staring before them murmuring indistinct questions jaded haggard unclean
one man in evening dress passed them on foot his eyes on the ground
they heard his voice and looking back at him saw one hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things
his paroxysm of rage over he went on his way without once looking back
as my brother's party went on towards the crossroads to the south of barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on their left carrying a child and with two other children and then passed a man in dirty black with a thick stick in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other
then round the corner of the lane from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high road came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat grey with dust
there were three girls east end factory girls and a couple of little children crowded in the cart
this'll tike us rahnd edgware
asked the driver wildeyed whitefaced and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the left he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks
my brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in front of them and veiling the white facade of a terrace beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas
mrs elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot blue sky
the tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of many voices the gride of many wheels the creaking of waggons and the staccato of hoofs
the lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads
good heavens
cried mrs elphinstone
what is this you are driving us into
my brother stopped
for the main road was a boiling stream of people a torrent of human beings rushing northward one pressing on another
a great bank of dust white and luminous in the blaze of the sun made everything within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and of men and women on foot and by the wheels of vehicles of every description
way
my brother heard voices crying
make way
it was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting point of the lane and road the crowd roared like a fire and the dust was hot and pungent
and indeed a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to add to the confusion
two men came past them
then a dirty woman carrying a heavy bundle and weeping
a lost retriever dog with hanging tongue circled dubiously round them scared and wretched and fled at my brother's threat
so much as they could see of the road londonward between the houses to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty hurrying people pent in between the villas on either side the black heads the crowded forms grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner hurried past and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust
go on
go on
cried the voices
way
way
one man's hands pressed on the back of another
my brother stood at the pony's head
irresistibly attracted he advanced slowly pace by pace down the lane
edgware had been a scene of confusion chalk farm a riotous tumult but this was a whole population in movement
it is hard to imagine that host
it had no character of its own
the figures poured out past the corner and receded with their backs to the group in the lane
along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels stumbling in the ditches blundering into one another
the carts and carriages crowded close upon one another making little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the villas
push on
was the cry
push on
they are coming
in one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the salvation army gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling eternity
eternity
his voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust
some of the people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and quarrelled with other drivers some sat motionless staring at nothing with miserable eyes some gnawed their hands with thirst or lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances
the horses' bits were covered with foam their eyes bloodshot
there were cabs carriages shop cars waggons beyond counting a mail cart a roadcleaner's cart marked vestry of st pancras a huge timber waggon crowded with roughs
a brewer's dray rumbled by with its two near wheels splashed with fresh blood
clear the way
cried the voices
clear the way
eternity
eternity
came echoing down the road
there were sad haggard women tramping by well dressed with children that cried and stumbled their dainty clothes smothered in dust their weary faces smeared with tears
with many of these came men sometimes helpful sometimes lowering and savage
fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags wideeyed loudvoiced and foulmouthed
there were sturdy workmen thrusting their way along wretched unkempt men clothed like clerks or shopmen struggling spasmodically a wounded soldier my brother noticed men dressed in the clothes of railway porters one wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it
but varied as its composition was certain things all that host had in common
there were fear and pain on their faces and fear behind them
a tumult up the road a quarrel for a place in a waggon sent the whole host of them quickening their pace even a man so scared and broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed activity
the heat and dust had already been at work upon this multitude
their skins were dry their lips black and cracked
they were all thirsty weary and footsore
and amid the various cries one heard disputes reproaches groans of weariness and fatigue the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak
through it all ran a refrain  way
way
the martians are coming
few stopped and came aside from that flood
the lane opened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of london
yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth weaklings elbowed out of the stream who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again
a little way down the lane with two friends bending over him lay a man with a bare leg wrapped about with bloody rags
he was a lucky man to have friends
a little old man with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat limped out and sat down beside the trap removed his boothis sock was bloodstainedshook out a pebble and hobbled on again and then a little girl of eight or nine all alone threw herself under the hedge close by my brother weeping
i can't go on
i can't go on
my brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up speaking gently to her and carried her to miss elphinstone
so soon as my brother touched her she became quite still as if frightened
ellen
shrieked a woman in the crowd with tears in her voiceellen
and the child suddenly darted away from my brother crying mother
they are coming said a man on horseback riding past along the lane
out of the way there
bawled a coachman towering high and my brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane
the people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse
my brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge and the man drove by and stopped at the turn of the way
it was a carriage with a pole for a pair of horses but only one was in the traces
my brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge
one of the men came running to my brother
where is there any water
he said
he is dying fast and very thirsty
it is lord garrick
lord garrick
said my brother the chief justice
the water
he said
there may be a tap said my brother in some of the houses
we have no water
i dare not leave my people
the man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house
go on
said the people thrusting at him
they are coming
go on
then my brother's attention was distracted by a bearded eaglefaced man lugging a small handbag which split even as my brother's eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up into separate coins as it struck the ground
they rolled hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses
the man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap and the shaft of a cab struck his shoulder and sent him reeling
he gave a shriek and dodged back and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly
way
cried the men all about him
make way
so soon as the cab had passed he flung himself with both hands open upon the heap of coins and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket
a horse rose close upon him and in another moment half rising he had been borne down under the horse's hoofs
stop
screamed my brother and pushing a woman out of his way tried to clutch the bit of the horse
before he could get to it he heard a scream under the wheels and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch's back
the driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother who ran round behind the cart
the multitudinous shouting confused his ears
the man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money unable to rise for the wheel had broken his back and his lower limbs lay limp and dead
my brother stood up and yelled at the next driver and a man on a black horse came to his assistance
get him out of the road said he and clutching the man's collar with his free hand my brother lugged him sideways
but he still clutched after his money and regarded my brother fiercely hammering at his arm with a handful of gold
go on
go on
shouted angry voices behind
way
way
there was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the man on horseback stopped
my brother looked up and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar
there was a concussion and the black horse came staggering sideways and the carthorse pushed beside it
a hoof missed my brother's foot by a hair's breadth
he released his grip on the fallen man and jumped back
he saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it
he saw miss elphinstone covering her eyes and a little child with all a child's want of sympathetic imagination staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still ground and crushed under the rolling wheels
let us go back
he shouted and began turning the pony round
we cannot cross thishell he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come until the fighting crowd was hidden
as they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet deadly white and drawn and shining with perspiration
the two women sat silent crouching in their seat and shivering
then beyond the bend my brother stopped again
miss elphinstone was white and pale and her sisterinlaw sat weeping too wretched even to call upon george
my brother was horrified and perplexed
so soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing
he turned to miss elphinstone suddenly resolute
we must go that way he said and led the pony round again
for the second time that day this girl proved her quality
to force their way into the torrent of people my brother plunged into the traffic and held back a cab horse while she drove the pony across its head
a waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise
in another moment they were caught and swept forward by the stream
my brother with the cabman's whip marks red across his face and hands scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her
point the revolver at the man behind he said giving it to her if he presses us too hard
nopoint it at his horse
then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across the road
but once in the stream he seemed to lose volition to become a part of that dusty rout
they swept through chipping barnet with the torrent they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the way
it was din and confusion indescribable but in and beyond the town the road forks repeatedly and this to some extent relieved the stress
they struck eastward through hadley and there on either side of the road and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinking at the stream some fighting to come at the water
and farther on from a lull near east barnet they saw two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or ordertrains swarming with people with men even among the coals behind the enginesgoing northward along the great northern railway
my brother supposes they must have filled outside london for at that time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini impossible
near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon for the violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them
they began to suffer the beginnings of hunger the night was cold and none of them dared to sleep
and in the evening many people came hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place fleeing from unknown dangers before them and going in the direction from which my brother had come
chapter seventeen  the thunder child   had the martians aimed only at destruction they might on monday have annihilated the entire population of london as it spread itself slowly through the home counties
not only along the road through barnet but also through edgware and waltham abbey and along the roads eastward to southend and shoeburyness and south of the thames to deal and broadstairs poured the same frantic rout
if one could have hung that june morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above london every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress
i have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother's account of the road through chipping barnet in order that my readers may realise how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned
never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together
the legendary hosts of goths and huns the hugest armies asia has ever seen would have been but a drop in that current
and this was no disciplined march it was a stampedea stampede gigantic and terriblewithout order and without a goal six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong
it was the beginning of the rout of civilisation of the massacre of mankind
directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of streets far and wide houses churches squares crescents gardensalready derelictspread out like a huge map and in the southward blotted
over ealing richmond wimbledon it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart
steadily incessantly each black splash grew and spread shooting out ramifications this way and that now banking itself against rising ground now pouring swiftly over a crest into a newfound valley exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper
and beyond over the blue hills that rise southward of the river the glittering martians went to and fro calmly and methodically spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose and taking possession of the conquered country
they do not seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition
they exploded any stores of powder they came upon cut every telegraph and wrecked the railways here and there
they were hamstringing mankind
they seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations and did not come beyond the central part of london all that day
it is possible that a very considerable number of people in london stuck to their houses through monday morning
certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the black smoke
until about midday the pool of london was an astonishing scene
steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there tempted by the enormous sums of money offered by fugitives and it is said that many who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned
about one o'clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of blackfriars bridge
at that the pool became a scene of mad confusion fighting and collision and for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern arch of the tower bridge and the sailors and lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront
people were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from above
when an hour later a martian appeared beyond the clock tower and waded down the river nothing but wreckage floated above limehouse
of the falling of the fifth cylinder i have presently to tell
the sixth star fell at wimbledon
my brother keeping watch beside the women in the chaise in a meadow saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills
on tuesday the little party still set upon getting across the sea made its way through the swarming country towards colchester
the news that the martians were now in possession of the whole of london was confirmed
they had been seen at highgate and even it was said at neasden
but they did not come into my brother's view until the morrow
that day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of provisions
as they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be regarded
farmers were out to defend their cattlesheds granaries and ripening root crops with arms in their hands
a number of people now like my brother had their faces eastward and there were some desperate souls even going back towards london to get food
these were chiefly people from the northern suburbs whose knowledge of the black smoke came by hearsay
he heard that about half the members of the government had gathered at birmingham and that enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines across the midland counties
he was also told that the midland railway company had replaced the desertions of the first day's panic had resumed traffic and was running northward trains from st albans to relieve the congestion of the home counties
there was also a placard in chipping ongar announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern towns and that within twentyfour hours bread would be distributed among the starving people in the neighbourhood
but this intelligence did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed and the three pressed eastward all day and heard no more of the bread distribution than this promise
nor as a matter of fact did anyone else hear more of it
that night fell the seventh star falling upon primrose hill
it fell while miss elphinstone was watching for she took that duty alternately with my brother
she saw it
on wednesday the three fugitivesthey had passed the night in a field of unripe wheatreached chelmsford and there a body of the inhabitants calling itself the committee of public supply seized the pony as provisions and would give nothing in exchange for it but the promise of a share in it the next day
here there were rumours of martians at epping and news of the destruction of waltham abbey powder mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders
people were watching for martians here from the church towers
my brother very luckily for him as it chanced preferred to push on at once to the coast rather than wait for food although all three of them were very hungry
by midday they passed through tillingham which strangely enough seemed to be quite silent and deserted save for a few furtive plunderers hunting for food
near tillingham they suddenly came in sight of the sea and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine
for after the sailors could no longer come up the thames they came on to the essex coast to harwich and walton and clacton and afterwards to foulness and shoebury to bring off the people
they lay in a huge sickleshaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the naze
close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacksenglish scotch french dutch and swedish steam launches from the thames yachts electric boats and beyond were ships of large burden a multitude of filthy colliers trim merchantmen cattle ships passenger boats petroleum tanks ocean tramps an old white transport even neat white and grey liners from southampton and hamburg and along the blue coast across the blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach a swarm which also extended up the blackwater almost to maldon
about a couple of miles out lay an ironclad very low in the water almost to my brother's perception like a waterlogged ship
this was the ram thunder child
it was the only warship in sight but far away to the right over the smooth surface of the seafor that day there was a dead calmlay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of the channel fleet which hovered in an extended line steam up and ready for action across the thames estuary during the course of the martian conquest vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it
at the sight of the sea mrs elphinstone in spite of the assurances of her sisterinlaw gave way to panic
she had never been out of england before she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country and so forth
she seemed poor woman to imagine that the french and the martians might prove very similar
she had been growing increasingly hysterical fearful and depressed during the two days' journeyings
her great idea was to return to stanmore
things had been always well and safe at stanmore
they would find george at stanmore
it was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the beach where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the thames
they sent a boat and drove a bargain for thirtysix pounds for the three
the steamer was going these men said to ostend
it was about two o'clock when my brother having paid their fares at the gangway found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his charges
there was food aboard albeit at exorbitant prices and the three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward
there were already a couple of score of passengers aboard some of whom had expended their last money in securing a passage but the captain lay off the blackwater until five in the afternoon picking up passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded
he would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour in the south
as if in answer the ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags
a jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels
some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from shoeburyness until it was noticed that it was growing louder
at the same time far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea beneath clouds of black smoke
but my brother's attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south
he fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze
the little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping and the low essex coast was growing blue and hazy when a martian appeared small and faint in the remote distance advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of foulness
at that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay and the paddles seemed infected with his terror
every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape higher than the trees or church towers inland and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human stride
it was the first martian my brother had seen and he stood more amazed than terrified watching this titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away
then far away beyond the crouch came another striding over some stunted trees and then yet another still farther off wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky
they were all stalking seaward as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between foulness and the naze
in spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddleboat and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance
glancing northwestward my brother saw the large crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror one ship passing behind another another coming round from broadside to end on steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam sails being let out launches rushing hither and thither
he was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward
and then a swift movement of the steamboat she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing
there was a shouting all about him a trampling of feet and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly
the steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands
he sprang to his feet and saw to starboard and not a hundred yards from their heeling pitching boat a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer flinging her paddles helplessly in the air and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline
a douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment
when his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward
big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire
it was the torpedo ram thunder child steaming headlong coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping
keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the martians again and he saw the three of them now close together and standing so far out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged
thus sunken and seen in remote perspective they appeared far less formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was pitching so helplessly
it would seem they were regarding this new antagonist with astonishment
to their intelligence it may be the giant was even such another as themselves
the thunder child fired no gun but simply drove full speed towards them
it was probably her not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did
they did not know what to make of her
one shell and they would have sent her to the bottom forthwith with the heatray
she was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway between the steamboat and the martiansa diminishing black bulk against the receding horizontal expanse of the essex coast
suddenly the foremost martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad
it hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward an unfolding torrent of black smoke from which the ironclad drove clear
to the watchers from the steamer low in the water and with the sun in their eyes it seemed as though she were already among the martians
they saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward and one of them raised the cameralike generator of the heatray
he held it pointing obliquely downward and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch
it must have driven through the iron of the ship's side like a whitehot iron rod through paper
a flicker of flame went up through the rising steam and then the martian reeled and staggered
in another moment he was cut down and a great body of water and steam shot high in the air
the guns of the thunder child sounded through the reek going off one after the other and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north and smashed a smack to matchwood
but no one heeded that very much
at the sight of the martian's collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately and all the crowding passengers on the steamer's stern shouted together
and then they yelled again
for surging out beyond the white tumult drove something long and black the flames streaming from its middle parts its ventilators and funnels spouting fire
she was alive still the steering gear it seems was intact and her engines working
she headed straight for a second martian and was within a hundred yards of him when the heatray came to bear
then with a violent thud a blinding flash her decks her funnels leaped upward
the martian staggered with the violence of her explosion and in another moment the flaming wreckage still driving forward with the impetus of its pace had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of cardboard
my brother shouted involuntarily
a boiling tumult of steam hid everything again
two
yelled the captain
everyone was shouting
the whole steamer from end to end rang with frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea
the steam hung upon the water for many minutes hiding the third martian and the coast altogether
and all this time the boat was paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight and when at last the confusion cleared the drifting bank of black vapour intervened and nothing of the thunder child could be made out nor could the third martian be seen
but the ironclads to seaward were now quite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat
the little vessel continued to beat its way seaward and the ironclads receded slowly towards the coast which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapour part steam part black gas eddying and combining in the strangest way
the fleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the steamboat
after a time and before they reached the sinking cloud bank the warships turned northward and then abruptly went about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward
the coast grew faint and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun
then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns and a form of black shadows moving
everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west but nothing was to be distinguished clearly
a mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun
the steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense
the sun sank into grey clouds the sky flushed and darkened the evening star trembled into sight
it was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed
my brother strained his eyes
something rushed up into the sky out of the greynessrushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky something flat and broad and very large that swept round in a vast curve grew smaller sank slowly and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night
and as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land
book two  the earth under the martians    chapter one  under foot   in the first book i have wandered so much from my own adventures to tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters i and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at halliford whither we fled to escape the black smoke
there i will resume
we stopped there all sunday night and all the next daythe day of the panicin a little island of daylight cut off by the black smoke from the rest of the world
we could do nothing but wait in aching inactivity during those two weary days
my mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife
i figured her at leatherhead terrified in danger mourning me already as a dead man
i paced the rooms and cried aloud when i thought of how i was cut off from her of all that might happen to her in my absence
my cousin i knew was brave enough for any emergency but he was not the sort of man to realise danger quickly to rise promptly
what was needed now was not bravery but circumspection
my only consolation was to believe that the martians were moving londonward and away from her
such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful
i grew very weary and irritable with the curate's perpetual ejaculations i tired of the sight of his selfish despair
after some ineffectual remonstrance i kept away from him staying in a roomevidently a children's schoolroomcontaining globes forms and copybooks
when he followed me thither i went to a box room at the top of the house and in order to be alone with my aching miseries locked myself in
we were hopelessly hemmed in by the black smoke all that day and the morning of the next
there were signs of people in the next house on sunday eveninga face at a window and moving lights and later the slamming of a door
but i do not know who these people were nor what became of them
we saw nothing of them next day
the black smoke drifted slowly riverward all through monday morning creeping nearer and nearer to us driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us
a martian came across the fields about midday laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls smashed all the windows it touched and scalded the curate's hand as he fled out of the front room
when at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it
looking towards the river we were astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows
for a time we did not see how this change affected our position save that we were relieved of our fear of the black smoke
but later i perceived that we were no longer hemmed in that now we might get away
so soon as i realised that the way of escape was open my dream of action returned
but the curate was lethargic unreasonable
we are safe here he repeated safe here
i resolved to leave himwould that i had
wiser now for the artilleryman's teaching i sought out food and drink
i had found oil and rags for my burns and i also took a hat and a flannel shirt that i found in one of the bedrooms
when it was clear to him that i meant to go alonehad reconciled myself to going alonehe suddenly roused himself to come
and all being quiet throughout the afternoon we started about five o'clock as i should judge along the blackened road to sunbury
in sunbury and at intervals along the road were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes horses as well as men overturned carts and luggage all covered thickly with black dust
that pall of cindery powder made me think of what i had read of the destruction of pompeii
we got to hampton court without misadventure our minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances and at hampton court our eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift
we went through bushey park with its deer going to and fro under the chestnuts and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards hampton and so we came to twickenham
these were the first people we saw
away across the road the woods beyond ham and petersham were still afire
twickenham was uninjured by either heatray or black smoke and there were more people about here though none could give us news
for the most part they were like ourselves taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters
i have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants too frightened even for flight
here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road
i remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts
we crossed richmond bridge about half past eight
we hurried across the exposed bridge of course but i noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses some many feet across
i did not know what these werethere was no time for scrutinyand i put a more horrible interpretation on them than they deserved
here again on the surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke and dead bodiesa heap near the approach to the station but we had no glimpse of the martians until we were some way towards barnes
we saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a side street towards the river but otherwise it seemed deserted
up the hill richmond town was burning briskly outside the town of richmond there was no trace of the black smoke
then suddenly as we approached kew came a number of people running and the upperworks of a martian fightingmachine loomed in sight over the housetops not a hundred yards away from us
we stood aghast at our danger and had the martian looked down we must immediately have perished
we were so terrified that we dared not go on but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden
there the curate crouched weeping silently and refusing to stir again
but my fixed idea of reaching leatherhead would not let me rest and in the twilight i ventured out again
i went through a shrubbery and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds and so emerged upon the road towards kew
the curate i left in the shed but he came hurrying after me
that second start was the most foolhardy thing i ever did
for it was manifest the martians were about us
no sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saw either the fightingmachine we had seen before or another far away across the meadows in the direction of kew lodge
four or five little black figures hurried before it across the greengrey of the field and in a moment it was evident this martian pursued them
in three strides he was among them and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions
he used no heatray to destroy them but picked them up one by one
apparently he tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him much as a workman's basket hangs over his shoulder
it was the first time i realised that the martians might have any other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity
we stood for a moment petrified then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled garden fell into rather than found a fortunate ditch and lay there scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out
i suppose it was nearly eleven o'clock before we gathered courage to start again no longer venturing into the road but sneaking along hedgerows and through plantations and watching keenly through the darkness he on the right and i on the left for the martians who seemed to be all about us
in one place we blundered upon a scorched and blackened area now cooling and ashen and a number of scattered dead bodies of men burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with their legs and boots mostly intact and of dead horses fifty feet perhaps behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages
sheen it seemed had escaped destruction but the place was silent and deserted
here we happened on no dead though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads of the place
in sheen my companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst and we decided to try one of the houses
the first house we entered after a little difficulty with the window was a small semidetached villa and i found nothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy cheese
there was however water to drink and i took a hatchet which promised to be useful in our next housebreaking
we then crossed to a place where the road turns towards mortlake
here there stood a white house within a walled garden and in the pantry of this domicile we found a store of foodtwo loaves of bread in a pan an uncooked steak and the half of a ham
i give this catalogue so precisely because as it happened we were destined to subsist upon this store for the next fortnight
bottled beer stood under a shelf and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces
this pantry opened into a kind of washup kitchen and in this was firewood there was also a cupboard in which we found nearly a dozen of burgundy tinned soups and salmon and two tins of biscuits
we sat in the adjacent kitchen in the darkfor we dared not strike a lightand ate bread and ham and drank beer out of the same bottle
the curate who was still timorous and restless was now oddly enough for pushing on and i was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us
it can't be midnight yet i said and then came a blinding glare of vivid green light
everything in the kitchen leaped out clearly visible in green and black and vanished again
and then followed such a concussion as i have never heard before or since
so close on the heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me a clash of glass a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us and the plaster of the ceiling came down upon us smashing into a multitude of fragments upon our heads
i was knocked headlong across the floor against the oven handle and stunned
i was insensible for a long time the curate told me and when i came to we were in darkness again and he with a face wet as i found afterwards with blood from a cut forehead was dabbing water over me
for some time i could not recollect what had happened
then things came to me slowly
a bruise on my temple asserted itself
are you better
asked the curate in a whisper
at last i answered him
i sat up
don't move he said
the floor is covered with smashed crockery from the dresser
you can't possibly move without making a noise and i fancy they are outside
we both sat quite silent so that we could scarcely hear each other breathing
everything seemed deadly still but once something near us some plaster or broken brickwork slid down with a rumbling sound
outside and very near was an intermittent metallic rattle
that
said the curate when presently it happened again
yes i said
but what is it
a martian
said the curate
i listened again
it was not like the heatray i said and for a time i was inclined to think one of the great fightingmachines had stumbled against the house as i had seen one stumble against the tower of shepperton church
our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or four hours until the dawn came we scarcely moved
and then the light filtered in not through the window which remained black but through a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us
the interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the first time
the window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould which flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet
outside the soil was banked high against the house
at the top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe
the floor was littered with smashed hardware the end of the kitchen towards the house was broken into and since the daylight shone in there it was evident the greater part of the house had collapsed
contrasting vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser stained in the fashion pale green and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it the wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range
as the dawn grew clearer we saw through the gap in the wall the body of a martian standing sentinel i suppose over the still glowing cylinder
at the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery
abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind
the fifth cylinder i whispered the fifth shot from mars has struck this house and buried us under the ruins
for a time the curate was silent and then he whispered  god have mercy upon us
i heard him presently whimpering to himself
save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery i for my part scarce dared breathe and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of the kitchen door
i could just see the curate's face a dim oval shape and his collar and cuffs
outside there began a metallic hammering then a violent hooting and then again after a quiet interval a hissing like the hissing of an engine
these noises for the most part problematical continued intermittently and seemed if anything to increase in number as time wore on
presently a measured thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels in the pantry ring and shift began and continued
once the light was eclipsed and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark
for many hours we must have crouched there silent and shivering until our tired attention failed     at last i found myself awake and very hungry
i am inclined to believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening
my hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action
i told the curate i was going to seek food and felt my way towards the pantry
he made me no answer but so soon as i began eating the faint noise i made stirred him up and i heard him crawling after me
chapter two  what we saw from the ruined house   after eating we crept back to the scullery and there i must have dozed again for when presently i looked round i was alone
the thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence
i whispered for the curate several times and at last felt my way to the door of the kitchen
it was still daylight and i perceived him across the room lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the martians
his shoulders were hunched so that his head was hidden from me
i could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed and the place rocked with that beating thud
through the aperture in the wall i could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky
for a minute or so i remained watching the curate and then i advanced crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor
i touched the curate's leg and he started so violently that a mass of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact
i gripped his arm fearing he might cry out and for a long time we crouched motionless
then i turned to see how much of our rampart remained
the detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open in the debris and by raising myself cautiously across a beam i was able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet suburban roadway
vast indeed was the change that we beheld
the fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house we had first visited
the building had vanished completely smashed pulverised and dispersed by the blow
the cylinder lay now far beneath the original foundationsdeep in a hole already vastly larger than the pit i had looked into at woking
the earth all round it had splashed under that tremendous impactsplashed is the only wordand lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses
it had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer
our house had collapsed backward the front portion even on the ground floor had been destroyed completely by a chance the kitchen and scullery had escaped and stood buried now under soil and ruins closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder
over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the martians were engaged in making
the heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole
the cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit and on the farther edge of the pit amid the smashed and gravelheaped shrubbery one of the great fightingmachines deserted by its occupant stood stiff and tall against the evening sky
at first i scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder although it has been convenient to describe them first on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism i saw busy in the excavation and on account of the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it
the mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first
it was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called handlingmachines and the study of which has already given such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention
as it dawned upon me first it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed agile legs and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers bars and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body
most of its arms were retracted but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods plates and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder
these as it extracted them were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it
its motion was so swift complex and perfect that at first i did not see it as a machine in spite of its metallic glitter
the fightingmachines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch but nothing to compare with this
people who have never seen these structures and have only the illimagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eyewitnesses as myself to go upon scarcely realise that living quality
i recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war
the artist had evidently made a hasty study of one of the fightingmachines and there his knowledge ended
he presented them as tilted stiff tripods without either flexibility or subtlety and with an altogether misleading monotony of effect
the pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable vogue and i mention them here simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created
they were no more like the martians i saw in action than a dutch doll is like a human being
to my mind the pamphlet would have been much better without them
at first i say the handlingmachine did not impress me as a machine but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument the controlling martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab's cerebral portion
but then i perceived the resemblance of its greybrown shiny leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond and the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me
with that realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures the real martians
already i had had a transient impression of these and the first nausea no longer obscured my observation
moreover i was concealed and motionless and under no urgency of action
they were i now saw the most unearthly creatures it is possible to conceive
they were huge round bodiesor rather headsabout four feet in diameter each body having in front of it a face
this face had no nostrilsindeed the martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell but it had a pair of very large darkcoloured eyes and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak
in the back of this head or bodyi scarcely know how to speak of itwas the single tight tympanic surface since known to be anatomically an ear though it must have been almost useless in our dense air
in a group round the mouth were sixteen slender almost whiplike tentacles arranged in two bunches of eight each
these bunches have since been named rather aptly by that distinguished anatomist professor howes the hands
even as i saw these martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands but of course with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions this was impossible
there is reason to suppose that on mars they may have progressed upon them with some facility
the internal anatomy i may remark here as dissection has since shown was almost equally simple
the greater part of the structure was the brain sending enormous nerves to the eyes ear and tactile tentacles
besides this were the bulky lungs into which the mouth opened and the heart and its vessels
the pulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin
and this was the sum of the martian organs
strange as it may seem to a human being all the complex apparatus of digestion which makes up the bulk of our bodies did not exist in the martians
they were headsmerely heads
entrails they had none
they did not eat much less digest
instead they took the fresh living blood of other creatures and injected it into their own veins
i have myself seen this being done as i shall mention in its place
but squeamish as i may seem i cannot bring myself to describe what i could not endure even to continue watching
let it suffice to say blood obtained from a still living animal in most cases from a human being was run directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal   
the bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us but at the same time i think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit
the physiological advantages of the practice of injection are undeniable if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process
our bodies are half made up of glands and tubes and organs occupied in turning heterogeneous food into blood
the digestive processes and their reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds
men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers or sound gastric glands
but the martians were lifted above all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion
their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had brought with them as provisions from mars
these creatures to judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands were bipeds with flimsy silicious skeletons almost like those of the silicious sponges and feeble musculature standing about six feet high and having round erect heads and large eyes in flinty sockets
two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder and all were killed before earth was reached
it was just as well for them for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every bone in their bodies
and while i am engaged in this description i may add in this place certain further details which although they were not all evident to us at the time will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures
in three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours
their organisms did not sleep any more than the heart of man sleeps
since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate that periodical extinction was unknown to them
they had little or no sense of fatigue it would seem
on earth they could never have moved without effort yet even to the last they kept in action
in twentyfour hours they did twentyfour hours of work as even on earth is perhaps the case with the ants
in the next place wonderful as it seems in a sexual world the martians were absolutely without sex and therefore without any of the tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men
a young martian there can now be no dispute was really born upon earth during the war and it was found attached to its parent partially budded off just as young lilybulbs bud off or like the young animals in the freshwater polyp
in man in all the higher terrestrial animals such a method of increase has disappeared but even on this earth it was certainly the primitive method
among the lower animals up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated animals the tunicates the two processes occur side by side but finally the sexual method superseded its competitor altogether
on mars however just the reverse has apparently been the case
it is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of quasiscientific repute writing long before the martian invasion did forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual martian condition
his prophecy i remember appeared in november or december  in a longdefunct publication the pall mall budget and i recall a caricature of it in a premartian periodical called punch
he pointed outwriting in a foolish facetious tonethat the perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs the perfection of chemical devices digestion that such organs as hair external nose teeth ears and chin were no longer essential parts of the human being and that the tendency of natural selection would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages
the brain alone remained a cardinal necessity
only one other part of the body had a strong case for survival and that was the hand teacher and agent of the brain
while the rest of the body dwindled the hands would grow larger
there is many a true word written in jest and here in the martians we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence
to me it is quite credible that the martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves by a gradual development of brain and hands the latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last at the expense of the rest of the body
without the body the brain would of course become a mere selfish intelligence without any of the emotional substratum of the human being
the last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular
microorganisms which cause so much disease and pain on earth have either never appeared upon mars or martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago
a hundred diseases all the fevers and contagions of human life consumption cancers tumours and such morbidities never enter the scheme of their life
and speaking of the differences between the life on mars and terrestrial life i may allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed
apparently the vegetable kingdom in mars instead of having green for a dominant colour is of a vivid bloodred tint
at any rate the seeds which the martians intentionally or accidentally brought with them gave rise in all cases to redcoloured growths
only that known popularly as the red weed however gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms
the red creeper was quite a transitory growth and few people have seen it growing
for a time however the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance
it spread up the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment and its cactuslike branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window
and afterwards i found it broadcast throughout the country and especially wherever there was a stream of water
the martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ a single round drum at the back of the headbody and eyes with a visual range not very different from ours except that according to philips blue and violet were as black to them
it is commonly supposed that they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations this is asserted for instance in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet written evidently by someone not an eyewitness of martian actions to which i have already alluded and which so far has been the chief source of information concerning them
now no surviving human being saw so much of the martians in action as i did
i take no credit to myself for an accident but the fact is so
and i assert that i watched them closely time after time and that i have seen four five and once six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations together without either sound or gesture
their peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding it had no modulation and was i believe in no sense a signal but merely the expiration of air preparatory to the suctional operation
i have a certain claim to at least an elementary knowledge of psychology and in this matter i am convincedas firmly as i am convinced of anythingthat the martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation
and i have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions
before the martian invasion as an occasional reader here or there may remember i had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory
the martians wore no clothing
their conceptions of ornament and decorum were necessarily different from ours and not only were they evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all seriously
yet though they wore no clothing it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great superiority over man lay
we men with our bicycles and roadskates our lilienthal soaringmachines our guns and sticks and so forth are just in the beginning of the evolution that the martians have worked out
they have become practically mere brains wearing different bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet
and of their appliances perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absentthe wheel is absent among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels
one would have at least expected it in locomotion
and in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth nature has never hit upon the wheel or has preferred other expedients to its development
and not only did the martians either not know of which is incredible or abstain from the wheel but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot with circular motions thereabout confined to one plane
almost all the joints of the machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully curved friction bearings
and while upon this matter of detail it is remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of electricity
in this way the curious parallelism to animal motions which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder was attained
such quasimuscles abounded in the crablike handlingmachine which on my first peeping out of the slit i watched unpacking the cylinder
it seemed infinitely more alive than the actual martians lying beyond it in the sunset light panting stirring ineffectual tentacles and moving feebly after their vast journey across space
while i was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight and noting each strange detail of their form the curate reminded me of his presence by pulling violently at my arm
i turned to a scowling face and silent eloquent lips
he wanted the slit which permitted only one of us to peep through and so i had to forego watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege
when i looked again the busy handlingmachine had already put together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own and down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner
this it was which had caused the regular beating noise and the rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering
it piped and whistled as it worked
so far as i could see the thing was without a directing martian at all
chapter three  the days of imprisonment   the arrival of a second fightingmachine drove us from our peephole into the scullery for we feared that from his elevation the martian might see down upon us behind our barrier
at a later date we began to feel less in danger of their eyes for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness but at first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery in heartthrobbing retreat
yet terrible as was the danger we incurred the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible
and i recall now with a sort of wonder that in spite of the infinite danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight
we would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of making a noise and strike each other and thrust and kick within a few inches of exposure
the fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits of thought and action and our danger and isolation only accentuated the incompatibility
at halliford i had already come to hate the curate's trick of helpless exclamation his stupid rigidity of mind
his endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort i made to think out a line of action and drove me at times thus pent up and intensified almost to the verge of craziness
he was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman
he would weep for hours together and i verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some way efficacious
and i would sit in the darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities
he ate more than i did and it was in vain i pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the martians had done with their pit that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food
he ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals
he slept little
as the days wore on his utter carelessness of any consideration so intensified our distress and danger that i had much as i loathed doing it to resort to threats and at last to blows
that brought him to reason for a time
but he was one of those weak creatures void of pride timorous anaemic hateful souls full of shifty cunning who face neither god nor man who face not even themselves
it is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things but i set them down that my story may lack nothing
those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality my flash of rage in our final tragedy easy enough to blame for they know what is wrong as well as any but not what is possible to tortured men
but those who have been under the shadow who have gone down at last to elemental things will have a wider charity
and while within we fought out our dark dim contest of whispers snatched food and drink and gripping hands and blows without in the pitiless sunlight of that terrible june was the strange wonder the unfamiliar routine of the martians in the pit
let me return to those first new experiences of mine
after a long time i ventured back to the peephole to find that the newcomers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer than three of the fightingmachines
these last had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder
the second handlingmachine was now completed and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the big machine had brought
this was a body resembling a milk can in its general form above which oscillated a pearshaped receptacle and from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below
the oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the handlingmachine
with two spatulate hands the handlingmachine was digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pearshaped receptacle above while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine
another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the mound of bluish dust
from this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air
as i looked the handlingmachine with a faint and musical clinking extended telescopic fashion a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt projection until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay
in another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight untarnished as yet and shining dazzlingly and deposited it in a growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit
between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred such bars out of the crude clay and the mound of bluish dust rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit
the contrast between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was acute and for days i had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two things
the curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought to the pit
i was sitting below huddled up listening with all my ears
he made a sudden movement backward and i fearful that we were observed crouched in a spasm of terror
he came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness inarticulate gesticulating and for a moment i shared his panic
his gesture suggested a resignation of the slit and after a little while my curiosity gave me courage and i rose up stepped across him and clambered up to it
at first i could see no reason for his frantic behaviour
the twilight had now come the stars were little and faint but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminiummaking
the whole picture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows strangely trying to the eyes
over and through it all went the bats heeding it not at all
the sprawling martians were no longer to be seen the mound of bluegreen powder had risen to cover them from sight and a fightingmachine with its legs contracted crumpled and abbreviated stood across the corner of the pit
and then amid the clangour of the machinery came a drifting suspicion of human voices that i entertained at first only to dismiss
i crouched watching this fightingmachine closely satisfying myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a martian
as the green flames lifted i could see the oily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes
and suddenly i heard a yell and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back
then somethingsomething struggling violentlywas lifted high against the sky a black vague enigma against the starlight and as this black object came down again i saw by the green brightness that it was a man
for an instant he was clearly visible
he was a stout ruddy middleaged man well dressed three days before he must have been walking the world a man of considerable consequence
i could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain
he vanished behind the mound and for a moment there was silence
and then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the martians
i slid down the rubbish struggled to my feet clapped my hands over my ears and bolted into the scullery
the curate who had been crouching silently with his arms over his head looked up as i passed cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him and came running after me
that night as we lurked in the scullery balanced between our horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had although i felt an urgent need of action i tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape but afterwards during the second day i was able to consider our position with great clearness
the curate i found was quite incapable of discussion this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all vestiges of reason or forethought
practically he had already sunk to the level of an animal
but as the saying goes i gripped myself with both hands
it grew upon my mind once i could face the facts that terrible as our position was there was as yet no justification for absolute despair
our chief chance lay in the possibility of the martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment
or even if they kept it permanently they might not consider it necessary to guard it and a chance of escape might be afforded us
i also weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a direction away from the pit but the chances of our emerging within sight of some sentinel fightingmachine seemed at first too great
and i should have had to do all the digging myself
the curate would certainly have failed me
it was on the third day if my memory serves me right that i saw the lad killed
it was the only occasion on which i actually saw the martians feed
after that experience i avoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a day
i went into the scullery removed the door and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible but when i had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth collapsed noisily and i did not dare continue
i lost heart and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time having no spirit even to move
and after that i abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by excavation
it says much for the impression the martians had made upon me that at first i entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about by their overthrow through any human effort
but on the fourth or fifth night i heard a sound like heavy guns
it was very late in the night and the moon was shining brightly
the martians had taken away the excavatingmachine and save for a fightingmachine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a handlingmachine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immediately beneath my peephole the place was deserted by them
except for the pale glow from the handlingmachine and the bars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness and except for the clinking of the handlingmachine quite still
that night was a beautiful serenity save for one planet the moon seemed to have the sky to herself
i heard a dog howling and that familiar sound it was that made me listen
then i heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like the sound of great guns
six distinct reports i counted and after a long interval six again
and that was all
chapter four  the death of the curate   it was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that i peeped for the last time and presently found myself alone
instead of keeping close to me and trying to oust me from the slit the curate had gone back into the scullery
i was struck by a sudden thought
i went back quickly and quietly into the scullery
in the darkness i heard the curate drinking
i snatched in the darkness and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy
for a few minutes there was a tussle
the bottle struck the floor and broke and i desisted and rose
we stood panting and threatening each other
in the end i planted myself between him and the food and told him of my determination to begin a discipline
i divided the food in the pantry into rations to last us ten days
i would not let him eat any more that day
in the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at the food
i had been dozing but in an instant i was awake
all day and all night we sat face to face i weary but resolute and he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger
it was i know a night and a day but to me it seemedit seems nowan interminable length of time
and so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict
for two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests
there were times when i beat and kicked him madly times when i cajoled and persuaded him and once i tried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy for there was a rainwater pump from which i could get water
but neither force nor kindness availed he was indeed beyond reason
he would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy babbling to himself
the rudimentary precautions to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe
slowly i began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence to perceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane
from certain vague memories i am inclined to think my own mind wandered at times
i had strange and hideous dreams whenever i slept
it sounds paradoxical but i am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity of the curate warned me braced me and kept me a sane man
on the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering and nothing i could do would moderate his speech
it is just o god
he would say over and over again
it is just
on me and mine be the punishment laid
we have sinned we have fallen short
there was poverty sorrow the poor were trodden in the dust and i held my peace
i preached acceptable follymy god what follywhen i should have stood up though i died for it and called upon them to repentrepent 
   oppressors of the poor and needy    
the wine press of god
then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food i withheld from him praying begging weeping at last threatening
he began to raise his voicei prayed him not to
he perceived a hold on mehe threatened he would shout and bring the martians upon us
for a time that scared me but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond estimating
i defied him although i felt no assurance that he might not do this thing
but that day at any rate he did not
he talked with his voice rising slowly through the greater part of the eighth and ninth daysthreats entreaties mingled with a torrent of halfsane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of god's service such as made me pity him
then he slept awhile and began again with renewed strength so loudly that i must needs make him desist
be still
i implored
he rose to his knees for he had been sitting in the darkness near the copper
i have been still too long he said in a tone that must have reached the pit and now i must bear my witness
woe unto this unfaithful city
woe
woe
woe
woe
woe
to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet  shut up
i said rising to my feet and in a terror lest the martians should hear us
for god's sake  nay shouted the curate at the top of his voice standing likewise and extending his arms
speak
the word of the lord is upon me
in three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen
i must bear my witness
i go
it has already been too long delayed
i put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall
in a flash i was after him
i was fierce with fear
before he was halfway across the kitchen i had overtaken him
with one last touch of humanity i turned the blade back and struck him with the butt
he went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground
i stumbled over him and stood panting
he lay still
suddenly i heard a noise without the run and smash of slipping plaster and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened
i looked up and saw the lower surface of a handlingmachine coming slowly across the hole
one of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris another limb appeared feeling its way over the fallen beams
i stood petrified staring
then i saw through a sort of glass plate near the edge of the body the face as we may call it and the large dark eyes of a martian peering and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole
i turned by an effort stumbled over the curate and stopped at the scullery door
the tentacle was now some way two yards or more in the room and twisting and turning with queer sudden movements this way and that
for a while i stood fascinated by that slow fitful advance
then with a faint hoarse cry i forced myself across the scullery
i trembled violently i could scarcely stand upright
i opened the door of the coal cellar and stood there in the darkness staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen and listening
had the martian seen me
what was it doing now
something was moving to and fro there very quietly every now and then it tapped against the wall or started on its movements with a faint metallic ringing like the movements of keys on a splitring
then a heavy bodyi knew too well whatwas dragged across the floor of the kitchen towards the opening
irresistibly attracted i crept to the door and peeped into the kitchen
in the triangle of bright outer sunlight i saw the martian in its briareus of a handlingmachine scrutinizing the curate's head
i thought at once that it would infer my presence from the mark of the blow i had given him
i crept back to the coal cellar shut the door and began to cover myself up as much as i could and as noiselessly as possible in the darkness among the firewood and coal therein
every now and then i paused rigid to hear if the martian had thrust its tentacles through the opening again
then the faint metallic jingle returned
i traced it slowly feeling over the kitchen
presently i heard it nearerin the scullery as i judged
i thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me
i prayed copiously
it passed scraping faintly across the cellar door
an age of almost intolerable suspense intervened then i heard it fumbling at the latch
it had found the door
the martians understood doors
it worried at the catch for a minute perhaps and then the door opened
in the darkness i could just see the thinglike an elephant's trunk more than anything elsewaving towards me and touching and examining the wall coals wood and ceiling
it was like a black worm swaying its blind head to and fro
once even it touched the heel of my boot
i was on the verge of screaming i bit my hand
for a time the tentacle was silent
i could have fancied it had been withdrawn
presently with an abrupt click it gripped somethingi thought it had meand seemed to go out of the cellar again
for a minute i was not sure
apparently it had taken a lump of coal to examine
i seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position which had become cramped and then listened
i whispered passionate prayers for safety
then i heard the slow deliberate sound creeping towards me again
slowly slowly it drew near scratching against the walls and tapping the furniture
while i was still doubtful it rapped smartly against the cellar door and closed it
i heard it go into the pantry and the biscuittins rattled and a bottle smashed and then came a heavy bump against the cellar door
then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense
had it gone
at last i decided that it had
it came into the scullery no more but i lay all the tenth day in the close darkness buried among coals and firewood not daring even to crawl out for the drink for which i craved
it was the eleventh day before i ventured so far from my security
chapter five  the stillness   my first act before i went into the pantry was to fasten the door between the kitchen and the scullery
but the pantry was empty every scrap of food had gone
apparently the martian had taken it all on the previous day
at that discovery i despaired for the first time
i took no food or no drink either on the eleventh or the twelfth day
at first my mouth and throat were parched and my strength ebbed sensibly
i sat about in the darkness of the scullery in a state of despondent wretchedness
my mind ran on eating
i thought i had become deaf for the noises of movement i had been accustomed to hear from the pit had ceased absolutely
i did not feel strong enough to crawl noiselessly to the peephole or i would have gone there
on the twelfth day my throat was so painful that taking the chance of alarming the martians i attacked the creaking rainwater pump that stood by the sink and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain water
i was greatly refreshed by this and emboldened by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping
during these days in a rambling inconclusive way i thought much of the curate and of the manner of his death
on the thirteenth day i drank some more water and dozed and thought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape
whenever i dozed i dreamt of horrible phantasms of the death of the curate or of sumptuous dinners but asleep or awake i felt a keen pain that urged me to drink again and again
the light that came into the scullery was no longer grey but red
to my disordered imagination it seemed the colour of blood
on the fourteenth day i went into the kitchen and i was surprised to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall turning the halflight of the place into a crimsoncoloured obscurity
it was early on the fifteenth day that i heard a curious familiar sequence of sounds in the kitchen and listening identified it as the snuffing and scratching of a dog
going into the kitchen i saw a dog's nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds
this greatly surprised me
at the scent of me he barked shortly
i thought if i could induce him to come into the place quietly i should be able perhaps to kill and eat him and in any case it would be advisable to kill him lest his actions attracted the attention of the martians
i crept forward saying good dog
very softly but he suddenly withdrew his head and disappeared
i listenedi was not deafbut certainly the pit was still
i heard a sound like the flutter of a bird's wings and a hoarse croaking but that was all
for a long while i lay close to the peephole but not daring to move aside the red plants that obscured it
once or twice i heard a faint pitterpatter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the sand far below me and there were more birdlike sounds but that was all
at length encouraged by the silence i looked out
except in the corner where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over the skeletons of the dead the martians had consumed there was not a living thing in the pit
i stared about me scarcely believing my eyes
all the machinery had gone
save for the big mound of greyishblue powder in one corner certain bars of aluminium in another the black birds and the skeletons of the killed the place was merely an empty circular pit in the sand
slowly i thrust myself out through the red weed and stood upon the mound of rubble
i could see in any direction save behind me to the north and neither martians nor sign of martians were to be seen
the pit dropped sheerly from my feet but a little way along the rubbish afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins
my chance of escape had come
i began to tremble
i hesitated for some time and then in a gust of desperate resolution and with a heart that throbbed violently i scrambled to the top of the mound in which i had been buried so long
i looked about again
to the northward too no martian was visible
when i had last seen this part of sheen in the daylight it had been a straggling street of comfortable white and red houses interspersed with abundant shady trees
now i stood on a mound of smashed brickwork clay and gravel over which spread a multitude of red cactusshaped plants kneehigh without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute their footing
the trees near me were dead and brown but further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems
the neighbouring houses had all been wrecked but none had been burned their walls stood sometimes to the second story with smashed windows and shattered doors
the red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms
below me was the great pit with the crows struggling for its refuse
a number of other birds hopped about among the ruins
far away i saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall but traces of men there were none
the day seemed by contrast with my recent confinement dazzlingly bright the sky a glowing blue
a gentle breeze kept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying
and oh
the sweetness of the air
chapter six  the work of fifteen days   for some time i stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety
within that noisome den from which i had emerged i had thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security
i had not realised what had been happening to the world had not anticipated this startling vision of unfamiliar things
i had expected to see sheen in ruinsi found about me the landscape weird and lurid of another planet
for that moment i touched an emotion beyond the common range of men yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well
i felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house
i felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my mind that oppressed me for many days a sense of dethronement a persuasion that i was no longer a master but an animal among the animals under the martian heel
with us it would be as with them to lurk and watch to run and hide the fear and empire of man had passed away
but so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed and my dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast
in the direction away from the pit i saw beyond a redcovered wall a patch of garden ground unburied
this gave me a hint and i went kneedeep and sometimes neckdeep in the red weed
the density of the weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding
the wall was some six feet high and when i attempted to clamber it i found i could not lift my feet to the crest
so i went along by the side of it and came to a corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top and tumble into the garden i coveted
here i found some young onions a couple of gladiolus bulbs and a quantity of immature carrots all of which i secured and scrambling over a ruined wall went on my way through scarlet and crimson trees towards kewit was like walking through an avenue of gigantic blood dropspossessed with two ideas to get more food and to limp as soon and as far as my strength permitted out of this accursed unearthly region of the pit
some way farther in a grassy place was a group of mushrooms which also i devoured and then i came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water where meadows used to be
these fragments of nourishment served only to whet my hunger
at first i was surprised at this flood in a hot dry summer but afterwards i discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the red weed
directly this extraordinary growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled fecundity
its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the wey and thames and its swiftly growing and titanic water fronds speedily choked both those rivers
at putney as i afterwards saw the bridge was almost lost in a tangle of this weed and at richmond too the thames water poured in a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of hampton and twickenham
as the water spread the weed followed them until the ruined villas of the thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp whose margin i explored and much of the desolation the martians had caused was concealed
in the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread
a cankering disease due it is believed to the action of certain bacteria presently seized upon it
now by the action of natural selection all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power against bacterial diseasesthey never succumb without a severe struggle but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead
the fronds became bleached and then shrivelled and brittle
they broke off at the least touch and the waters that had stimulated their early growth carried their last vestiges out to sea
my first act on coming to this water was of course to slake my thirst
i drank a great deal of it and moved by an impulse gnawed some fronds of red weed but they were watery and had a sickly metallic taste
i found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely although the red weed impeded my feet a little but the flood evidently got deeper towards the river and i turned back to mortlake
i managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins of its villas and fences and lamps and so presently i got out of this spate and made my way to the hill going up towards roehampton and came out on putney common
here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the wreckage of the familiar patches of ground exhibited the devastation of a cyclone and in a few score yards i would come upon perfectly undisturbed spaces houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors closed as if they had been left for a day by the owners or as if their inhabitants slept within
the red weed was less abundant the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper
i hunted for food among the trees finding nothing and i also raided a couple of silent houses but they had already been broken into and ransacked
i rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery being in my enfeebled condition too fatigued to push on
all this time i saw no human beings and no signs of the martians
i encountered a couple of hungrylooking dogs but both hurried circuitously away from the advances i made them
near roehampton i had seen two human skeletonsnot bodies but skeletons picked cleanand in the wood by me i found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep
but though i gnawed parts of these in my mouth there was nothing to be got from them
after sunset i struggled on along the road towards putney where i think the heatray must have been used for some reason
and in the garden beyond roehampton i got a quantity of immature potatoes sufficient to stay my hunger
from this garden one looked down upon putney and the river
the aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate blackened trees blackened desolate ruins and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river redtinged with the weed
and over allsilence
it filled me with indescribable terror to think how swiftly that desolating change had come
for a time i believed that mankind had been swept out of existence and that i stood there alone the last man left alive
hard by the top of putney hill i came upon another skeleton with the arms dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body
as i proceeded i became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was save for such stragglers as myself already accomplished in this part of the world
the martians i thought had gone on and left the country desolated seeking food elsewhere
perhaps even now they were destroying berlin or paris or it might be they had gone northward
chapter seven  the man on putney hill   i spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of putney hill sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to leatherhead
i will not tell the needless trouble i had breaking into that houseafterwards i found the front door was on the latchnor how i ransacked every room for food until just on the verge of despair in what seemed to me to be a servant's bedroom i found a ratgnawed crust and two tins of pineapple
the place had been already searched and emptied
in the bar i afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked
the latter i could not eat they were too rotten but the former not only stayed my hunger but filled my pockets
i lit no lamps fearing some martian might come beating that part of london for food in the night
before i went to bed i had an interval of restlessness and prowled from window to window peering out for some sign of these monsters
i slept little
as i lay in bed i found myself thinking consecutivelya thing i do not remember to have done since my last argument with the curate
during all the intervening time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity
but in the night my brain reinforced i suppose by the food i had eaten grew clear again and i thought
three things struggled for possession of my mind the killing of the curate the whereabouts of the martians and the possible fate of my wife
the former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall i saw it simply as a thing done a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse
i saw myself then as i see myself now driven step by step towards that hasty blow the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that
i felt no condemnation yet the memory static unprogressive haunted me
in the silence of the night with that sense of the nearness of god that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness i stood my trial my only trial for that moment of wrath and fear
i retraced every step of our conversation from the moment when i had found him crouching beside me heedless of my thirst and pointing to the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of weybridge
we had been incapable of cooperationgrim chance had taken no heed of that
had i foreseen i should have left him at halliford
but i did not foresee and crime is to foresee and do
and i set this down as i have set all this story down as it was
there were no witnessesall these things i might have concealed
but i set it down and the reader must form his judgment as he will
and when by an effort i had set aside that picture of a prostrate body i faced the problem of the martians and the fate of my wife
for the former i had no data i could imagine a hundred things and so unhappily i could for the latter
and suddenly that night became terrible
i found myself sitting up in bed staring at the dark
i found myself praying that the heatray might have suddenly and painlessly struck her out of being
since the night of my return from leatherhead i had not prayed
i had uttered prayers fetish prayers had prayed as heathens mutter charms when i was in extremity but now i prayed indeed pleading steadfastly and sanely face to face with the darkness of god
strange night
strangest in this that so soon as dawn had come i who had talked with god crept out of the house like a rat leaving its hiding placea creature scarcely larger an inferior animal a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be hunted and killed
perhaps they also prayed confidently to god
surely if we have learned nothing else this war has taught us pitypity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion
the morning was bright and fine and the eastern sky glowed pink and was fretted with little golden clouds
in the road that runs from the top of putney hill to wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the panic torrent that must have poured londonward on the sunday night after the fighting began
there was a little twowheeled cart inscribed with the name of thomas lobb greengrocer new malden with a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk there was a straw hat trampled into the now hardened mud and at the top of west hill a lot of bloodstained glass about the overturned water trough
my movements were languid my plans of the vaguest
i had an idea of going to leatherhead though i knew that there i had the poorest chance of finding my wife
certainly unless death had overtaken them suddenly my cousins and she would have fled thence but it seemed to me i might find or learn there whither the surrey people had fled
i knew i wanted to find my wife that my heart ached for her and the world of men but i had no clear idea how the finding might be done
i was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness
from the corner i went under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes to the edge of wimbledon common stretching wide and far
that dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom there was no red weed to be seen and as i prowled hesitating on the verge of the open the sun rose flooding it all with light and vitality
i came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the trees
i stopped to look at them drawing a lesson from their stout resolve to live
and presently turning suddenly with an odd feeling of being watched i beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes
i stood regarding this
i made a step towards it and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass
i approached him slowly
he stood silent and motionless regarding me
as i drew nearer i perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and filthy as my own he looked indeed as though he had been dragged through a culvert
nearer i distinguished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny coaly patches
his black hair fell over his eyes and his face was dark and dirty and sunken so that at first i did not recognise him
there was a red cut across the lower part of his face
stop
he cried when i was within ten yards of him and i stopped
his voice was hoarse
where do you come from
he said
i thought surveying him
i come from mortlake i said
i was buried near the pit the martians made about their cylinder
i have worked my way out and escaped
there is no food about here he said
this is my country
all this hill down to the river and back to clapham and up to the edge of the common
there is only food for one
which way are you going
i answered slowly
i don't know i said
i have been buried in the ruins of a house thirteen or fourteen days
i don't know what has happened
he looked at me doubtfully then started and looked with a changed expression
i've no wish to stop about here said i
i think i shall go to leatherhead for my wife was there
he shot out a pointing finger
it is you said he the man from woking
and you weren't killed at weybridge
i recognised him at the same moment
you are the artilleryman who came into my garden
good luck
he said
we are lucky ones
fancy you
he put out a hand and i took it
i crawled up a drain he said
but they didn't kill everyone
and after they went away i got off towards walton across the fields
but it's not sixteen days altogetherand your hair is grey
he looked over his shoulder suddenly
only a rook he said
one gets to know that birds have shadows these days
this is a bit open
let us crawl under those bushes and talk
have you seen any martians
i said
since i crawled out  they've gone away across london he said
i guess they've got a bigger camp there
of a night all over there hampstead way the sky is alive with their lights
it's like a great city and in the glare you can just see them moving
by daylight you can't
but neareri haven't seen them he counted on his fingers five days
then i saw a couple across hammersmith way carrying something big
and the night before lasthe stopped and spoke impressivelyit was just a matter of lights but it was something up in the air
i believe they've built a flyingmachine and are learning to fly
i stopped on hands and knees for we had come to the bushes
fly
yes he said fly
i went on into a little bower and sat down
it is all over with humanity i said
if they can do that they will simply go round the world
he nodded
they will
but it will relieve things over here a bit
and besides  he looked at me
aren't you satisfied it is up with humanity
i am
we're down we're beat
i stared
strange as it may seem i had not arrived at this facta fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke
i had still held a vague hope rather i had kept a lifelong habit of mind
he repeated his words we're beat
they carried absolute conviction
it's all over he said
they've lost onejust one
and they've made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world
they've walked over us
the death of that one at weybridge was an accident
and these are only pioneers
they kept on coming
these green starsi've seen none these five or six days but i've no doubt they're falling somewhere every night
nothing's to be done
we're under
we're beat
i made him no answer
i sat staring before me trying in vain to devise some countervailing thought
this isn't a war said the artilleryman
it never was a war any more than there's war between man and ants
suddenly i recalled the night in the observatory
after the tenth shot they fired no moreat least until the first cylinder came
how do you know
said the artilleryman
i explained
he thought
something wrong with the gun he said
but what if there is
they'll get it right again
and even if there's a delay how can it alter the end
it's just men and ants
there's the ants builds their cities live their lives have wars revolutions until the men want them out of the way and then they go out of the way
that's what we are nowjust ants
only  yes i said
we're eatable ants
we sat looking at each other
and what will they do with us
i said
that's what i've been thinking he said that's what i've been thinking
after weybridge i went souththinking
i saw what was up
most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves
but i'm not so fond of squealing
i've been in sight of death once or twice i'm not an ornamental soldier and at the best and worst deathit's just death
and it's the man that keeps on thinking comes through
i saw everyone tracking away south
says i 'food won't last this way' and i turned right back
i went for the martians like a sparrow goes for man
all roundhe waved a hand to the horizonthey're starving in heaps bolting treading on each other     he saw my face and halted awkwardly
no doubt lots who had money have gone away to france he said
he seemed to hesitate whether to apologise met my eyes and went on there's food all about here
canned things in shops wines spirits mineral waters and the water mains and drains are empty
well i was telling you what i was thinking
'here's intelligent things' i said 'and it seems they want us for food
first they'll smash us upships machines guns cities all the order and organisation
all that will go
if we were the size of ants we might pull through
but we're not
it's all too bulky to stop
that's the first certainty'
eh
i assented
it is i've thought it out
very well thennext at present we're caught as we're wanted
a martian has only to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run
and i saw one one day out by wandsworth picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage
but they won't keep on doing that
so soon as they've settled all our guns and ships and smashed our railways and done all the things they are doing over there they will begin catching us systematic picking the best and storing us in cages and things
that's what they will start doing in a bit
lord
they haven't begun on us yet
don't you see that
not begun
i exclaimed
not begun
all that's happened so far is through our not having the sense to keep quietworrying them with guns and such foolery
and losing our heads and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn't any more safety than where we were
they don't want to bother us yet
they're making their thingsmaking all the things they couldn't bring with them getting things ready for the rest of their people
very likely that's why the cylinders have stopped for a bit for fear of hitting those who are here
and instead of our rushing about blind on the howl or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up we've got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs
that's how i figure it out
it isn't quite according to what a man wants for his species but it's about what the facts point to
and that's the principle i acted upon
cities nations civilisation progressit's all over
that game's up
we're beat
but if that is so what is there to live for
the artilleryman looked at me for a moment
there won't be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so there won't be any royal academy of arts and no nice little feeds at restaurants
if it's amusement you're after i reckon the game is up
if you've got any drawingroom manners or a dislike to eating peas with a knife or dropping aitches you'd better chuck 'em away
they ain't no further use
you mean  i mean that men like me are going on livingfor the sake of the breed
i tell you i'm grim set on living
and if i'm not mistaken you'll show what insides you've got too before long
we aren't going to be exterminated
and i don't mean to be caught either and tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox
ugh
fancy those brown creepers
you don't mean to say  i do
i'm going on under their feet
i've got it planned i've thought it out
we men are beat
we don't know enough
we've got to learn before we've got a chance
and we've got to live and keep independent while we learn
see
that's what has to be done
i stared astonished and stirred profoundly by the man's resolution
great god
cried i
but you are a man indeed
and suddenly i gripped his hand
eh
he said with his eyes shining
i've thought it out eh
go on i said
well those who mean to escape their catching must get ready
i'm getting ready
mind you it isn't all of us that are made for wild beasts and that's what it's got to be
that's why i watched you
i had my doubts
you're slender
i didn't know that it was you you see or just how you'd been buried
all thesethe sort of people that lived in these houses and all those damn little clerks that used to live down that waythey'd be no good
they haven't any spirit in themno proud dreams and no proud lusts and a man who hasn't one or the otherlord
what is he but funk and precautions
they just used to skedaddle off to worki've seen hundreds of 'em bit of breakfast in hand running wild and shining to catch their little seasonticket train for fear they'd get dismissed if they didn't working at businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand skedaddling back for fear they wouldn't be in time for dinner keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets and sleeping with the wives they married not because they wanted them but because they had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world
lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents
and on sundaysfear of the hereafter
as if hell was built for rabbits
well the martians will just be a godsend to these
nice roomy cages fattening food careful breeding no worry
after a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty stomachs they'll come and be caught cheerful
they'll be quite glad after a bit
they'll wonder what people did before there were martians to take care of them
and the bar loafers and mashers and singersi can imagine them
i can imagine them he said with a sort of sombre gratification
there'll be any amount of sentiment and religion loose among them
there's hundreds of things i saw with my eyes that i've only begun to see clearly these last few days
there's lots will take things as they arefat and stupid and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it's all wrong and that they ought to be doing something
now whenever things are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something the weak and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking always make for a sort of donothing religion very pious and superior and submit to persecution and the will of the lord
very likely you've seen the same thing
it's energy in a gale of funk and turned clean inside out
these cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety
and those of a less simple sort will work in a bit ofwhat is iteroticism
he paused
very likely these martians will make pets of some of them train them to do trickswho knowsget sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed
and some maybe they will train to hunt us
no i cried that's impossible
no human being  what's the good of going on with such lies
said the artilleryman
there's men who'd do it cheerful
what nonsense to pretend there isn't
and i succumbed to his conviction
if they come after me he said lord if they come after me
and subsided into a grim meditation
i sat contemplating these things
i could find nothing to bring against this man's reasoning
in the days before the invasion no one would have questioned my intellectual superiority to hisi a professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes and he a common soldier and yet he had already formulated a situation that i had scarcely realised
what are you doing
i said presently
what plans have you made
he hesitated
well it's like this he said
what have we to do
we have to invent a sort of life where men can live and breed and be sufficiently secure to bring the children up
yeswait a bit and i'll make it clearer what i think ought to be done
the tame ones will go like all tame beasts in a few generations they'll be big beautiful richblooded stupidrubbish
the risk is that we who keep wild will go savagedegenerate into a sort of big savage rat    you see how i mean to live is underground
i've been thinking about the drains
of course those who don't know drains think horrible things but under this london are miles and mileshundreds of milesand a few days rain and london empty will leave them sweet and clean
the main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone
then there's cellars vaults stores from which bolting passages may be made to the drains
and the railway tunnels and subways
eh
you begin to see
and we form a bandablebodied cleanminded men
we're not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in
weaklings go out again
as you meant me to go
welli parleyed didn't i
we won't quarrel about that
go on
those who stop obey orders
ablebodied cleanminded women we want alsomothers and teachers
no lackadaisical ladiesno blasted rolling eyes
we can't have any weak or silly
life is real again and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die
they ought to die
they ought to be willing to die
it's a sort of disloyalty after all to live and taint the race
and they can't be happy
moreover dying's none so dreadful it's the funking makes it bad
and in all those places we shall gather
our district will be london
and we may even be able to keep a watch and run about in the open when the martians keep away
play cricket perhaps
that's how we shall save the race
eh
it's a possible thing
but saving the race is nothing in itself
as i say that's only being rats
it's saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing
there men like you come in
there's books there's models
we must make great safe places down deep and get all the books we can not novels and poetry swipes but ideas science books
that's where men like you come in
we must go to the british museum and pick all those books through
especially we must keep up our sciencelearn more
we must watch these martians
some of us must go as spies
when it's all working perhaps i will
get caught i mean
and the great thing is we must leave the martians alone
we mustn't even steal
if we get in their way we clear out
we must show them we mean no harm
yes i know
but they're intelligent things and they won't hunt us down if they have all they want and think we're just harmless vermin
the artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm
after all it may not be so much we may have to learn beforejust imagine this four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting offheatrays right and left and not a martian in 'em
not a martian in 'em but menmen who have learned the way how
it may be in my time eventhose men
fancy having one of them lovely things with its heatray wide and free
fancy having it in control
what would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run after a bust like that
i reckon the martians'll open their beautiful eyes
can't you see them man
can't you see them hurrying hurryingpuffing and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs
something out of gear in every case
and swish bang rattle swish
just as they are fumbling over it swish comes the heatray and behold
man has come back to his own
for a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman and the tone of assurance and courage he assumed completely dominated my mind
i believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme and the reader who thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject and mine crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening distracted by apprehension
we talked in this manner through the early morning time and later crept out of the bushes and after scanning the sky for martians hurried precipitately to the house on putney hill where he had made his lair
it was the coal cellar of the place and when i saw the work he had spent a week uponit was a burrow scarcely ten yards long which he designed to reach to the main drain on putney hilli had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers
such a hole i could have dug in a day
but i believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at his digging
we had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range
we refreshed ourselves with a tin of mockturtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry
i found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady labour
as we worked i turned his project over in my mind and presently objections and doubts began to arise but i worked there all the morning so glad was i to find myself with a purpose again
after working an hour i began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached the chances we had of missing it altogether
my immediate trouble was why we should dig this long tunnel when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of the manholes and work back to the house
it seemed to me too that the house was inconveniently chosen and required a needless length of tunnel
and just as i was beginning to face these things the artilleryman stopped digging and looked at me
we're working well he said
he put down his spade
let us knock off a bit he said
i think it's time we reconnoitred from the roof of the house
i was for going on and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade and then suddenly i was struck by a thought
i stopped and so did he at once
why were you walking about the common i said instead of being here
taking the air he said
i was coming back
it's safer by night
but the work
oh one can't always work he said and in a flash i saw the man plain
he hesitated holding his spade
we ought to reconnoitre now he said because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop upon us unawares
i was no longer disposed to object
we went together to the roof and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door
no martians were to be seen and we ventured out on the tiles and slipped down under shelter of the parapet
from this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of putney but we could see the river below a bubbly mass of red weed and the low parts of lambeth flooded and red
the red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace and their branches stretched gaunt and dead and set with shrivelled leaves from amid its clusters
it was strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their propagation
about us neither had gained a footing laburnums pink mays snowballs and trees of arborvitae rose out of laurels and hydrangeas green and brilliant into the sunlight
beyond kensington dense smoke was rising and that and a blue haze hid the northward hills
the artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still remained in london
one night last week he said some fools got the electric light in order and there was all regent street and the circus ablaze crowded with painted and ragged drunkards men and women dancing and shouting till dawn
a man who was there told me
and as the day came they became aware of a fightingmachine standing near by the langham and looking down at them
heaven knows how long he had been there
it must have given some of them a nasty turn
he came down the road towards them and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away
grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe
from that in answer to my questions he came round to his grandiose plans again
he grew enthusiastic
he talked so eloquently of the possibility of capturing a fightingmachine that i more than half believed in him again
but now that i was beginning to understand something of his quality i could divine the stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately
and i noted that now there was no question that he personally was to capture and fight the great machine
after a time we went down to the cellar
neither of us seemed disposed to resume digging and when he suggested a meal i was nothing loath
he became suddenly very generous and when we had eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars
we lit these and his optimism glowed
he was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion
there's some champagne in the cellar he said
we can dig better on this thamesside burgundy said i
no said he i am host today
champagne
great god
we've a heavy enough task before us
let us take a rest and gather strength while we may
look at these blistered hands
and pursuant to this idea of a holiday he insisted upon playing cards after we had eaten
he taught me euchre and after dividing london between us i taking the northern side and he the southern we played for parish points
grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober reader it is absolutely true and what is more remarkable i found the card game and several others we played extremely interesting
strange mind of man
that with our species upon the edge of extermination or appalling degradation with no clear prospect before us but the chance of a horrible death we could sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard and playing the joker with vivid delight
afterwards he taught me poker and i beat him at three tough chess games
when dark came we decided to take the risk and lit a lamp
after an interminable string of games we supped and the artilleryman finished the champagne
we went on smoking the cigars
he was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species i had encountered in the morning
he was still optimistic but it was a less kinetic a more thoughtful optimism
i remember he wound up with my health proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence
i took a cigar and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the highgate hills
at first i stared unintelligently across the london valley
the northern hills were shrouded in darkness the fires near kensington glowed redly and now and then an orangered tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep blue night
all the rest of london was black
then nearer i perceived a strange light a pale violetpurple fluorescent glow quivering under the night breeze
for a space i could not understand it and then i knew that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded
with that realisation my dormant sense of wonder my sense of the proportion of things awoke again
i glanced from that to mars red and clear glowing high in the west and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of hampstead and highgate
i remained a very long time upon the roof wondering at the grotesque changes of the day
i recalled my mental states from the midnight prayer to the foolish cardplaying
i had a violent revulsion of feeling
i remember i flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful symbolism
my folly came to me with glaring exaggeration
i seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind i was filled with remorse
i resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony and to go on into london
there it seemed to me i had the best chance of learning what the martians and my fellowmen were doing
i was still upon the roof when the late moon rose
chapter eight  dead london   after i had parted from the artilleryman i went down the hill and by the high street across the bridge to fulham
the red weed was tumultuous at that time and nearly choked the bridge roadway but its fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly
at the corner of the lane that runs to putney bridge station i found a man lying
he was as black as a sweep with the black dust alive but helplessly and speechlessly drunk
i could get nothing from him but curses and furious lunges at my head
i think i should have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face
there was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards and it grew thicker in fulham
the streets were horribly quiet
i got foodsour hard and mouldy but quite eatablein a baker's shop here
some way towards walham green the streets became clear of powder and i passed a white terrace of houses on fire the noise of the burning was an absolute relief
going on towards brompton the streets were quiet again
here i came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon dead bodies
i saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the fulham road
they had been dead many days so that i hurried quickly past them
the black powder covered them over and softened their outlines
one or two had been disturbed by dogs
where there was no black powder it was curiously like a sunday in the city with the closed shops the houses locked up and the blinds drawn the desertion and the stillness
in some places plunderers had been at work but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops
a jeweller's window had been broken open in one place but apparently the thief had been disturbed and a number of gold chains and a watch lay scattered on the pavement
i did not trouble to touch them
farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep the hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement
she seemed asleep but she was dead
the farther i penetrated into london the profounder grew the stillness
but it was not so much the stillness of deathit was the stillness of suspense of expectation
at any time the destruction that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis and had annihilated ealing and kilburn might strike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins
it was a city condemned and derelict   
in south kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder
it was near south kensington that i first heard the howling
it crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses
it was a sobbing alternation of two notes ulla ulla ulla ulla keeping on perpetually
when i passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again
it came in a full tide down exhibition road
i stopped staring towards kensington gardens wondering at this strange remote wailing
it was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude
ulla ulla ulla ulla wailed that superhuman notegreat waves of sound sweeping down the broad sunlit roadway between the tall buildings on each side
i turned northwards marvelling towards the iron gates of hyde park
i had half a mind to break into the natural history museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers in order to see across the park
but i decided to keep to the ground where quick hiding was possible and so went on up the exhibition road
all the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses
at the top near the park gate i came upon a strange sighta bus overturned and the skeleton of a horse picked clean
i puzzled over this for a time and then went on to the bridge over the serpentine
the voice grew stronger and stronger though i could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park save a haze of smoke to the northwest
ulla ulla ulla ulla cried the voice coming as it seemed to me from the district about regent's park
the desolating cry worked upon my mind
the mood that had sustained me passed
the wailing took possession of me
i found i was intensely weary footsore and now again hungry and thirsty
it was already past noon
why was i wandering alone in this city of the dead
why was i alone when all london was lying in state and in its black shroud
i felt intolerably lonely
my mind ran on old friends that i had forgotten for years
i thought of the poisons in the chemists' shops of the liquors the wine merchants stored i recalled the two sodden creatures of despair who so far as i knew shared the city with myself   
i came into oxford street by the marble arch and here again were black powder and several bodies and an evil ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses
i grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk
with infinite trouble i managed to break into a publichouse and get food and drink
i was weary after eating and went into the parlour behind the bar and slept on a black horsehair sofa i found there
i awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears ulla ulla ulla ulla
it was now dusk and after i had routed out some biscuits and a cheese in the barthere was a meat safe but it contained nothing but maggotsi wandered on through the silent residential squares to baker streetportman square is the only one i can nameand so came out at last upon regent's park
and as i emerged from the top of baker street i saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset the hood of the martian giant from which this howling proceeded
i was not terrified
i came upon him as if it were a matter of course
i watched him for some time but he did not move
he appeared to be standing and yelling for no reason that i could discover
i tried to formulate a plan of action
that perpetual sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla confused my mind
perhaps i was too tired to be very fearful
certainly i was more curious to know the reason of this monotonous crying than afraid
i turned back away from the park and struck into park road intending to skirt the park went along under the shelter of the terraces and got a view of this stationary howling martian from the direction of st john's wood
a couple of hundred yards out of baker street i heard a yelping chorus and saw first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him
he made a wide curve to avoid me as though he feared i might prove a fresh competitor
as the yelping died away down the silent road the wailing sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla reasserted itself
i came upon the wrecked handlingmachine halfway to st john's wood station
at first i thought a house had fallen across the road
it was only as i clambered among the ruins that i saw with a start this mechanical samson lying with its tentacles bent and smashed and twisted among the ruins it had made
the forepart was shattered
it seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house and had been overwhelmed in its overthrow
it seemed to me then that this might have happened by a handlingmachine escaping from the guidance of its martian
i could not clamber among the ruins to see it and the twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was smeared and the gnawed gristle of the martian that the dogs had left were invisible to me
wondering still more at all that i had seen i pushed on towards primrose hill
far away through a gap in the trees i saw a second martian as motionless as the first standing in the park towards the zoological gardens and silent
a little beyond the ruins about the smashed handlingmachine i came upon the red weed again and found the regent's canal a spongy mass of darkred vegetation
as i crossed the bridge the sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla ceased
it was as it were cut off
the silence came like a thunderclap
the dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim the trees towards the park were growing black
all about me the red weed clambered among the ruins writhing to get above me in the dimness
night the mother of fear and mystery was coming upon me
but while that voice sounded the solitude the desolation had been endurable by virtue of it london had still seemed alive and the sense of life about me had upheld me
then suddenly a change the passing of somethingi knew not whatand then a stillness that could be felt
nothing but this gaunt quiet
london about me gazed at me spectrally
the windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls
about me my imagination found a thousand noiseless enemies moving
terror seized me a horror of my temerity
in front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred and i saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway
i could not bring myself to go on
i turned down st john's wood road and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards kilburn
i hid from the night and the silence until long after midnight in a cabmen's shelter in harrow road
but before the dawn my courage returned and while the stars were still in the sky i turned once more towards regent's park
i missed my way among the streets and presently saw down a long avenue in the halflight of the early dawn the curve of primrose hill
on the summit towering up to the fading stars was a third martian erect and motionless like the others
an insane resolve possessed me
i would die and end it
and i would save myself even the trouble of killing myself
i marched on recklessly towards this titan and then as i drew nearer and the light grew i saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about the hood
at that my heart gave a bound and i began running along the road
i hurried through the red weed that choked st edmund's terrace i waded breasthigh across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworks towards the albert road and emerged upon the grass before the rising of the sun
great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the hill making a huge redoubt of itit was the final and largest place the martians had madeand from behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky
against the sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared
the thought that had flashed into my mind grew real grew credible
i felt no fear only a wild trembling exultation as i ran up the hill towards the motionless monster
out of the hood hung lank shreds of brown at which the hungry birds pecked and tore
in another moment i had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon its crest and the interior of the redoubt was below me
a mighty space it was with gigantic machines here and there within it huge mounds of material and strange shelter places
and scattered about it some in their overturned warmachines some in the now rigid handlingmachines and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row were the martiansdeadslain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared slain as the red weed was being slain slain after all man's devices had failed by the humblest things that god in his wisdom has put upon this earth
for so it had come about as indeed i and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds
these germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of thingstaken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here
but by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power to no germs do we succumb without a struggle and to manythose that cause putrefaction in dead matter for instanceour living frames are altogether immune
but there are no bacteria in mars and directly these invaders arrived directly they drank and fed our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow
already when i watched them they were irrevocably doomed dying and rotting even as they went to and fro
it was inevitable
by the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth and it is his against all comers it would still be his were the martians ten times as mighty as they are
for neither do men live nor die in vain
here and there they were scattered nearly fifty altogether in that great gulf they had made overtaken by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be
to me also at that time this death was incomprehensible
all i knew was that these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead
for a moment i believed that the destruction of sennacherib had been repeated that god had repented that the angel of death had slain them in the night
i stood staring into the pit and my heart lightened gloriously even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays
the pit was still in darkness the mighty engines so great and wonderful in their power and complexity so unearthly in their tortuous forms rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light
a multitude of dogs i could hear fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit far below me
across the pit on its farther lip flat and vast and strange lay the great flyingmachine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when decay and death arrested them
death had come not a day too soon
at the sound of a cawing overhead i looked up at the huge fightingmachine that would fight no more for ever at the tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of primrose hill
i turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where enhaloed now in birds stood those other two martians that i had seen overnight just as death had overtaken them
the one had died even as it had been crying to its companions perhaps it was the last to die and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted
they glittered now harmless tripod towers of shining metal in the brightness of the rising sun
all about the pit and saved as by a miracle from everlasting destruction stretched the great mother of cities
those who have only seen london veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses
eastward over the blackened ruins of the albert terrace and the splintered spire of the church the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with a white intensity
northward were kilburn and hampsted blue and crowded with houses westward the great city was dimmed and southward beyond the martians the green waves of regent's park the langham hotel the dome of the albert hall the imperial institute and the giant mansions of the brompton road came out clear and little in the sunrise the jagged ruins of westminster rising hazily beyond
far away and blue were the surrey hills and the towers of the crystal palace glittered like two silver rods
the dome of st paul's was dark against the sunrise and injured i saw for the first time by a huge gaping cavity on its western side
and as i looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and churches silent and abandoned as i thought of the multitudinous hopes and efforts the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all when i realised that the shadow had been rolled back and that men might still live in the streets and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful i felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears
the torment was over
even that day the healing would begin
the survivors of the people scattered over the countryleaderless lawless foodless like sheep without a shepherdthe thousands who had fled by sea would begin to return the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares
whatever destruction was done the hand of the destroyer was stayed
all the gaunt wrecks the blackened skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with the tapping of their trowels
at the thought i extended my hands towards the sky and began thanking god
in a year thought iin a year
   with overwhelming force came the thought of myself of my wife and the old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever
chapter nine  wreckage   and now comes the strangest thing in my story
yet perhaps it is not altogether strange
i remember clearly and coldly and vividly all that i did that day until the time that i stood weeping and praising god upon the summit of primrose hill
and then i forget
of the next three days i know nothing
i have learned since that so far from my being the first discoverer of the martian overthrow several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the previous night
one manthe firsthad gone to st martin'slegrand and while i sheltered in the cabmen's hut had contrived to telegraph to paris
thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world a thousand cities chilled by ghastly apprehensions suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations they knew of it in dublin edinburgh manchester birmingham at the time when i stood upon the verge of the pit
already men weeping with joy as i have heard shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout were making up trains even as near as crewe to descend upon london
the church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news until all england was bellringing
men on cycles leanfaced unkempt scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance shouting to gaunt staring figures of despair
and for the food
across the channel across the irish sea across the atlantic corn bread and meat were tearing to our relief
all the shipping in the world seemed going londonward in those days
but of all this i have no memory
i drifteda demented man
i found myself in a house of kindly people who had found me on the third day wandering weeping and raving through the streets of st john's wood
they have told me since that i was singing some insane doggerel about the last man left alive
hurrah
the last man left alive
troubled as they were with their own affairs these people whose name much as i would like to express my gratitude to them i may not even give here nevertheless cumbered themselves with me sheltered me and protected me from myself
apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse
very gently when my mind was assured again did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of leatherhead
two days after i was imprisoned it had been destroyed with every soul in it by a martian
he had swept it out of existence as it seemed without any provocation as a boy might crush an ant hill in the mere wantonness of power
i was a lonely man and they were very kind to me
i was a lonely man and a sad one and they bore with me
i remained with them four days after my recovery
all that time i felt a vague a growing craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so happy and bright in my past
it was a mere hopeless desire to feast upon my misery
they dissuaded me
they did all they could to divert me from this morbidity
but at last i could resist the impulse no longer and promising faithfully to return to them and parting as i will confess from these fourday friends with tears i went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty
already they were busy with returning people in places even there were shops open and i saw a drinking fountain running water
i remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as i went back on my melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at woking how busy the streets and vivid the moving life about me
so many people were abroad everywhere busied in a thousand activities that it seemed incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been slain
but then i noticed how yellow were the skins of the people i met how shaggy the hair of the men how large and bright their eyes and that every other man still wore his dirty rags
their faces seemed all with one of two expressionsa leaping exultation and energy or a grim resolution
save for the expression of the faces london seemed a city of tramps
the vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent us by the french government
the ribs of the few horses showed dismally
haggard special constables with white badges stood at the corners of every street
i saw little of the mischief wrought by the martians until i reached wellington street and there i saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of waterloo bridge
at the corner of the bridge too i saw one of the common contrasts of that grotesque timea sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the red weed transfixed by a stick that kept it in place
it was the placard of the first newspaper to resume publicationthe daily mail
i bought a copy for a blackened shilling i found in my pocket
most of it was in blank but the solitary compositor who did the thing had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on the back page
the matter he printed was emotional the news organisation had not as yet found its way back
i learned nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results
among other things the article assured me what i did not believe at the time that the secret of flying was discovered
at waterloo i found the free trains that were taking people to their homes
the first rush was already over
there were few people in the train and i was in no mood for casual conversation
i got a compartment to myself and sat with folded arms looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows
and just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins
to clapham junction the face of london was grimy with powder of the black smoke in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain and at clapham junction the line had been wrecked again there were hundreds of outofwork clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary navvies and we were jolted over a hasty relaying
all down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and unfamiliar wimbledon particularly had suffered
walton by virtue of its unburned pine woods seemed the least hurt of any place along the line
the wandle the mole every little stream was a heaped mass of red weed in appearance between butcher's meat and pickled cabbage
the surrey pine woods were too dry however for the festoons of the red climber
beyond wimbledon within sight of the line in certain nursery grounds were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder
a number of people were standing about it and some sappers were busy in the midst of it
over it flaunted a union jack flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze
the nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows and very painful to the eye
one's gaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the bluegreen softness of the eastward hills
the line on the london side of woking station was still undergoing repair so i descended at byfleet station and took the road to maybury past the place where i and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars and on by the spot where the martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm
here moved by curiosity i turned aside to find among a tangle of red fronds the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed
for a time i stood regarding these vestiges     then i returned through the pine wood neckhigh with red weed here and there to find the landlord of the spotted dog had already found burial and so came home past the college arms
a man standing at an open cottage door greeted me by name as i passed
i looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately
the door had been forced it was unfast and was opening slowly as i approached
it slammed again
the curtains of my study fluttered out of the open window from which i and the artilleryman had watched the dawn
no one had closed it since
the smashed bushes were just as i had left them nearly four weeks ago
i stumbled into the hall and the house felt empty
the stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where i had crouched soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the catastrophe
our muddy footsteps i saw still went up the stairs
i followed them to my study and found lying on my writingtable still with the selenite paper weight upon it the sheet of work i had left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder
for a space i stood reading over my abandoned arguments
it was a paper on the probable development of moral ideas with the development of the civilising process and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy in about two hundred years i had written we may expect  the sentence ended abruptly
i remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning scarcely a month gone by and how i had broken off to get my daily chronicle from the newsboy
i remembered how i went down to the garden gate as he came along and how i had listened to his odd story of men from mars
i came down and went into the dining room
there were the mutton and the bread both far gone now in decay and a beer bottle overturned just as i and the artilleryman had left them
my home was desolate
i perceived the folly of the faint hope i had cherished so long
and then a strange thing occurred
it is no use said a voice
the house is deserted
no one has been here these ten days
do not stay here to torment yourself
no one escaped but you
i was startled
had i spoken my thought aloud
i turned and the french window was open behind me
i made a step to it and stood looking out
and there amazed and afraid even as i stood amazed and afraid were my cousin and my wifemy wife white and tearless
she gave a faint cry
i came she said
i knewknew  she put her hand to her throatswayed
i made a step forward and caught her in my arms
chapter ten  the epilogue   i cannot but regret now that i am concluding my story how little i am able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions which are still unsettled
in one respect i shall certainly provoke criticism
my particular province is speculative philosophy
my knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two but it seems to me that carver's suggestions as to the reason of the rapid death of the martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a proven conclusion
i have assumed that in the body of my narrative
at any rate in all the bodies of the martians that were examined after the war no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species were found
that they did not bury any of their dead and the reckless slaughter they perpetrated point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process
but probable as this seems it is by no means a proven conclusion
neither is the composition of the black smoke known which the martians used with such deadly effect and the generator of the heatrays remains a puzzle
the terrible disasters at the ealing and south kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further investigations upon the latter
spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the green and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood
but such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader to whom this story is addressed
none of the brown scum that drifted down the thames after the destruction of shepperton was examined at the time and now none is forthcoming
the results of an anatomical examination of the martians so far as the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible i have already given
but everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost complete specimen in spirits at the natural history museum and the countless drawings that have been made from it and beyond that the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific
a question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of another attack from the martians
i do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter
at present the planet mars is in conjunction but with every return to opposition i for one anticipate a renewal of their adventure
in any case we should be prepared
it seems to me that it should be possible to define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack
in that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the martians to emerge or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened
it seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of their first surprise
possibly they see it in the same light
lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet venus
seven months ago now venus and mars were in alignment with the sun that is to say mars was in opposition from the point of view of an observer on venus
subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet and almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was detected upon a photograph of the martian disk
one needs to see the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their remarkable resemblance in character
at any rate whether we expect another invasion or not our views of the human future must be greatly modified by these events
we have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for man we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space
it may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men it has robbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of decadence the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous and it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of mankind
it may be that across the immensity of space the martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson and that on the planet venus they have found a securer settlement
be that as it may for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the martian disk and those fiery darts of the sky the shooting stars will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men
the broadening of men's views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated
before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere
now we see further
if the martians can reach venus there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable as at last it must do it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils
dim and wonderful is the vision i have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space
but that is a remote dream
it may be on the other hand that the destruction of the martians is only a reprieve
to them and not to us perhaps is the future ordained
i must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind
i sit in my study writing by lamplight and suddenly i see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames and feel the house behind and about me empty and desolate
i go out into the byfleet road and vehicles pass me a butcher boy in a cart a cabful of visitors a workman on a bicycle children going to school and suddenly they become vague and unreal and i hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot brooding silence
of a night i see the black powder darkening the silent streets and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer they rise upon me tattered and dogbitten
they gibber and grow fiercer paler uglier mad distortions of humanity at last and i wake cold and wretched in the darkness of the night
i go to london and see the busy multitudes in fleet street and the strand and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past haunting the streets that i have seen silent and wretched going to and fro phantasms in a dead city the mockery of life in a galvanised body
and strange too it is to stand on primrose hill as i did but a day before writing this last chapter to see the great province of houses dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and mist vanishing at last into the vague lower sky to see the people walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill to see the sightseers about the martian machine that stands there still to hear the tumult of playing children and to recall the time when i saw it all bright and clearcut hard and silent under the dawn of that last great day     and strangest of all is it to hold my wife's hand again and to think that i have counted her and that she has counted me among the dead
