part i    i   this is the saddest story i have ever heard
we had known the ashburnhams for nine seasons of the town of nauheim with an extreme intimacyor rather with an acquaintanceship as loose and easy and yet as close as a good glove's with your hand
my wife and i knew captain and mrs ashburnham as well as it was possible to know anybody and yet in another sense we knew nothing at all about them
this is i believe a state of things only possible with english people of whom till today when i sit down to puzzle out what i know of this sad affair i knew nothing whatever
six months ago i had never been to england and certainly i had never sounded the depths of an english heart
i had known the shallows
i don't mean to say that we were not acquainted with many english people
living as we perforce lived in europe and being as we perforce were leisured americans which is as much as to say that we were unamerican we were thrown very much into the society of the nicer english
paris you see was our home
somewhere between nice and bordighera provided yearly winter quarters for us and nauheim always received us from july to september
you will gather from this statement that one of us had as the saying is a heart and from the statement that my wife is dead that she was the sufferer
captain ashburnham also had a heart
but whereas a yearly month or so at nauheim tuned him up to exactly the right pitch for the rest of the twelvemonth the two months or so were only just enough to keep poor florence alive from year to year
the reason for his heart was approximately polo or too much hard sportsmanship in his youth
the reason for poor florence's broken years was a storm at sea upon our first crossing to europe and the immediate reasons for our imprisonment in that continent were doctor's orders
they said that even the short channel crossing might well kill the poor thing
when we all first met captain ashburnham home on sick leave from an india to which he was never to return was thirtythree mrs ashburnham leonorawas thirtyone
i was thirtysix and poor florence thirty
thus today florence would have been thirtynine and captain ashburnham fortytwo whereas i am fortyfive and leonora forty
you will perceive therefore that our friendship has been a youngmiddleaged affair since we were all of us of quite quiet dispositions the ashburnhams being more particularly what in england it is the custom to call quite good people
they were descended as you will probably expect from the ashburnham who accompanied charles i to the scaffold and as you must also expect with this class of english people you would never have noticed it
mrs ashburnham was a powys florence was a hurlbird of stamford connecticut where as you know they are more oldfashioned than even the inhabitants of cranford england could have been
i myself am a dowell of philadelphia pa where it is historically true there are more old english families than you would find in any six english counties taken together
i carry about with me indeedas if it were the only thing that invisibly anchored me to any spot upon the globethe title deeds of my farm which once covered several blocks between chestnut and walnut streets
these title deeds are of wampum the grant of an indian chief to the first dowell who left farnham in surrey in company with william penn
florence's people as is so often the case with the inhabitants of connecticut came from the neighbourhood of fordingbridge where the ashburnhams' place is
from there at this moment i am actually writing
you may well ask why i write
and yet my reasons are quite many
for it is not unusual in human beings who have witnessed the sack of a city or the falling to pieces of a people to desire to set down what they have witnessed for the benefit of unknown heirs or of generations infinitely remote or if you please just to get the sight out of their heads
some one has said that the death of a mouse from cancer is the whole sack of rome by the goths and i swear to you that the breaking up of our little foursquare coterie was such another unthinkable event
supposing that you should come upon us sitting together at one of the little tables in front of the club house let us say at homburg taking tea of an afternoon and watching the miniature golf you would have said that as human affairs go we were an extraordinarily safe castle
we were if you will one of those tall ships with the white sails upon a blue sea one of those things that seem the proudest and the safest of all the beautiful and safe things that god has permitted the mind of men to frame
where better could one take refuge
where better
permanence
stability
i can't believe it's gone
i can't believe that that long tranquil life which was just stepping a minuet vanished in four crashing days at the end of nine years and six weeks
upon my word yes our intimacy was like a minuet simply because on every possible occasion and in every possible circumstance we knew where to go where to sit which table we unanimously should choose and we could rise and go all four together without a signal from any one of us always to the music of the kur orchestra always in the temperate sunshine or if it rained in discreet shelters
no indeed it can't be gone
you can't kill a minuet de la cour
you may shut up the musicbook close the harpsichord in the cupboard and presses the rats may destroy the white satin favours
the mob may sack versailles the trianon may fall but surely the minuetthe minuet itself is dancing itself away into the furthest stars even as our minuet of the hessian bathing places must be stepping itself still
isn't there any heaven where old beautiful dances old beautiful intimacies prolong themselves
isn't there any nirvana pervaded by the faint thrilling of instruments that have fallen into the dust of wormwood but that yet had frail tremulous and everlasting souls
no by god it is false
it wasn't a minuet that we stepped it was a prisona prison full of screaming hysterics tied down so that they might not outsound the rolling of our carriage wheels as we went along the shaded avenues of the taunus wald
and yet i swear by the sacred name of my creator that it was true
it was true sunshine the true music the true splash of the fountains from the mouth of stone dolphins
for if for me we were four people with the same tastes with the same desires actingor no not actingsitting here and there unanimously isn't that the truth
if for nine years i have possessed a goodly apple that is rotten at the core and discover its rottenness only in nine years and six months less four days isn't it true to say that for nine years i possessed a goodly apple
so it may well be with edward ashburnham with leonora his wife and with poor dear florence
and if you come to think of it isn't it a little odd that the physical rottenness of at least two pillars of our foursquare house never presented itself to my mind as a menace to its security
it doesn't so present itself now though the two of them are actually dead
i don't know
i know nothingnothing in the worldof the hearts of men
i only know that i am alonehorribly alone
no hearthstone will ever again witness for me friendly intercourse
no smokingroom will ever be other than peopled with incalculable simulacra amidst smoke wreaths
yet in the name of god what should i know if i don't know the life of the hearth and of the smokingroom since my whole life has been passed in those places
the warm hearthsidewell there was florence i believe that for the twelve years her life lasted after the storm that seemed irretrievably to have weakened her hearti don't believe that for one minute she was out of my sight except when she was safely tucked up in bed and i should be downstairs talking to some good fellow or other in some lounge or smokingroom or taking my final turn with a cigar before going to bed
i don't you understand blame florence
but how can she have known what she knew
how could she have got to know it
to know it so fully
heavens
there doesn't seem to have been the actual time
it must have been when i was taking my baths and my swedish exercises being manicured
leading the life i did of the sedulous strained nurse i had to do something to keep myself fit
it must have been then
yet even that can't have been enough time to get the tremendously long conversations full of worldly wisdom that leonora has reported to me since their deaths
and is it possible to imagine that during our prescribed walks in nauheim and the neighbourhood she found time to carry on the protracted negotiations which she did carry on between edward ashburnham and his wife
and isn't it incredible that during all that time edward and leonora never spoke a word to each other in private
what is one to think of humanity
for i swear to you that they were the model couple
he was as devoted as it was possible to be without appearing fatuous
so well set up with such honest blue eyes such a touch of stupidity such a warm goodheartedness
and sheso tall so splendid in the saddle so fair
yes leonora was extraordinarily fair and so extraordinarily the real thing that she seemed too good to be true
you don't i mean as a rule get it all so superlatively together
to be the county family to look the county family to be so appropriately and perfectly wealthy to be so perfect in mannereven just to the saving touch of insolence that seems to be necessary
to have all that and to be all that
no it was too good to be true
and yet only this afternoon talking over the whole matter she said to me once i tried to have a lover but i was so sick at the heart so utterly worn out that i had to send him away
that struck me as the most amazing thing i had ever heard
she said i was actually in a man's arms
such a nice chap
such a dear fellow
and i was saying to myself fiercely hissing it between my teeth as they say in novelsand really clenching them together i was saying to myself 'now i'm in for it and i'll really have a good time for once in my lifefor once in my life'
it was in the dark in a carriage coming back from a hunt ball
eleven miles we had to drive
and then suddenly the bitterness of the endless poverty of the endless actingit fell on me like a blight it spoilt everything
yes i had to realize that i had been spoilt even for the good time when it came
and i burst out crying and i cried and i cried for the whole eleven miles
just imagine me crying
and just imagine me making a fool of the poor dear chap like that
it certainly wasn't playing the game was it now
i don't know i don't know was that last remark of hers the remark of a harlot or is it what every decent woman county family or not county family thinks at the bottom of her heart
or thinks all the time for the matter of that
who knows
yet if one doesn't know that at this hour and day at this pitch of civilization to which we have attained after all the preachings of all the moralists and all the teachings of all the mothers to all the daughters in saecula saeculorum but perhaps that is what all mothers teach all daughters not with lips but with the eyes or with heart whispering to heart
and if one doesn't know as much as that about the first thing in the world what does one know and why is one here
i asked mrs ashburnham whether she had told florence that and what florence had said and she answeredflorence didn't offer any comment at all
what could she say
there wasn't anything to be said
with the grinding poverty we had to put up with to keep up appearances and the way the poverty came aboutyou know what i meanany woman would have been justified in taking a lover and presents too
florence once said about a very similar positionshe was a little too wellbred too american to talk about minethat it was a case of perfectly open riding and the woman could just act on the spur of the moment
she said it in american of course but that was the sense of it
i think her actual words were 'that it was up to her to take it or leave it'  i don't want you to think that i am writing teddy ashburnham down a brute
i don't believe he was
god knows perhaps all men are like that
for as i've said what do i know even of the smokingroom
fellows come in and tell the most extraordinarily gross storiesso gross that they will positively give you a pain
and yet they'd be offended if you suggested that they weren't the sort of person you could trust your wife alone with
and very likely they'd be quite properly offendedthat is if you can trust anybody alone with anybody
but that sort of fellow obviously takes more delight in listening to or in telling gross storiesmore delight than in anything else in the world
they'll hunt languidly and dress languidly and dine languidly and work without enthusiasm and find it a bore to carry on three minutes' conversation about anything whatever and yet when the other sort of conversation begins they'll laugh and wake up and throw themselves about in their chairs
then if they so delight in the narration how is it possible that they can be offendedand properly offendedat the suggestion that they might make attempts upon your wife's honour
or again edward ashburnham was the cleanest looking sort of chapan excellent magistrate a first rate soldier one of the best landlords so they said in hampshire england
to the poor and to hopeless drunkards as i myself have witnessed he was like a painstaking guardian
and he never told a story that couldn't have gone into the columns of the field more than once or twice in all the nine years of my knowing him
he didn't even like hearing them he would fidget and get up and go out to buy a cigar or something of that sort
you would have said that he was just exactly the sort of chap that you could have trusted your wife with
and i trusted mine and it was madness
and yet again you have me
if poor edward was dangerous because of the chastity of his expressionsand they say that is always the hallmark of a libertinewhat about myself
for i solemnly avow that not only have i never so much as hinted at an impropriety in my conversation in the whole of my days and more than that i will vouch for the cleanness of my thoughts and the absolute chastity of my life
at what then does it all work out
is the whole thing a folly and a mockery
am i no better than a eunuch or is the proper manthe man with the right to existencea raging stallion forever neighing after his neighbour's womankind
i don't know
and there is nothing to guide us
and if everything is so nebulous about a matter so elementary as the morals of sex what is there to guide us in the more subtle morality of all other personal contacts associations and activities
or are we meant to act on impulse alone
it is all a darkness
ii  i don't know how it is best to put this thing downwhether it would be better to try and tell the story from the beginning as if it were a story or whether to tell it from this distance of time as it reached me from the lips of leonora or from those of edward himself
so i shall just imagine myself for a fortnight or so at one side of the fireplace of a country cottage with a sympathetic soul opposite me
and i shall go on talking in a low voice while the sea sounds in the distance and overhead the great black flood of wind polishes the bright stars
from time to time we shall get up and go to the door and look out at the great moon and say why it is nearly as bright as in provence
and then we shall come back to the fireside with just the touch of a sigh because we are not in that provence where even the saddest stories are gay
consider the lamentable history of peire vidal
two years ago florence and i motored from biarritz to las tours which is in the black mountains
in the middle of a tortuous valley there rises up an immense pinnacle and on the pinnacle are four castleslas tours the towers
and the immense mistral blew down that valley which was the way from france into provence so that the silver grey olive leaves appeared like hair flying in the wind and the tufts of rosemary crept into the iron rocks that they might not be torn up by the roots
it was of course poor dear florence who wanted to go to las tours
you are to imagine that however much her bright personality came from stamford connecticut she was yet a graduate of poughkeepsie
i never could imagine how she did itthe queer chattery person that she was
with the faraway look in her eyeswhich wasn't however in the least romantici mean that she didn't look as if she were seeing poetic dreams or looking through you for she hardly ever did look at youholding up one hand as if she wished to silence any objectionor any comment for the matter of thatshe would talk
she would talk about william the silent about gustave the loquacious about paris frocks about how the poor dressed in  about fantinlatour about the parislyonsmediterrane traindeluxe about whether it would be worth while to get off at tarascon and go across the windswept suspensionbridge over the rhone to take another look at beaucaire
we never did take another look at beaucaire of coursebeautiful beaucaire with the high triangular white tower that looked as thin as a needle and as tall as the flatiron between fifth and broadwaybeaucaire with the grey walls on the top of the pinnacle surrounding an acre and a half of blue irises beneath the tallness of the stone pines what a beautiful thing the stone pine is
no we never did go back anywhere
not to heidelberg not to hamelin not to verona not to mont majournot so much as to carcassonne itself
we talked of it of course but i guess florence got all she wanted out of one look at a place
she had the seeing eye
i haven't unfortunately so that the world is full of places to which i want to returntowns with the blinding white sun upon them stone pines against the blue of the sky corners of gables all carved and painted with stags and scarlet flowers and crowstepped gables with the little saint at the top and grey and pink palazzi and walled towns a mile or so back from the sea on the mediterranean between leghorn and naples
not one of them did we see more than once so that the whole world for me is like spots of colour in an immense canvas
perhaps if it weren't so i should have something to catch hold of now
is all this digression or isn't it digression
again i don't know
you the listener sit opposite me
but you are so silent
you don't tell me anything
i am at any rate trying to get you to see what sort of life it was i led with florence and what florence was like
well she was bright and she danced
she seemed to dance over the floors of castles and over seas and over and over and over the salons of modistes and over the plages of the rivieralike a gay tremulous beam reflected from water upon a ceiling
and my function in life was to keep that bright thing in existence
and it was almost as difficult as trying to catch with your hand that dancing reflection
and the task lasted for years
florence's aunts used to say that i must be the laziest man in philadelphia
they had never been to philadelphia and they had the new england conscience
you see the first thing they said to me when i called in on florence in the little ancient colonial wooden house beneath the high thinleaved elmsthe first question they asked me was not how i did but what did i do
and i did nothing
i suppose i ought to have done something but i didn't see any call to do it
why does one do things
i just drifted in and wanted florence
first i had drifted in on florence at a browning tea or something of the sort in fourteenth street which was then still residential
i don't know why i had gone to new york i don't know why i had gone to the tea
i don't see why florence should have gone to that sort of spelling bee
it wasn't the place at which even then you expected to find a poughkeepsie graduate
i guess florence wanted to raise the culture of the stuyvesant crowd and did it as she might have gone in slumming
intellectual slumming that was what it was
she always wanted to leave the world a little more elevated than she found it
poor dear thing i have heard her lecture teddy ashburnham by the hour on the difference between a franz hals and a wouvermans and why the premycenaean statues were cubical with knobs on the top
i wonder what he made of it
perhaps he was thankful
i know i was
for do you understand my whole attentions my whole endeavours were to keep poor dear florence on to topics like the finds at cnossos and the mental spirituality of walter pater
i had to keep her at it you understand or she might die
for i was solemnly informed that if she became excited over anything or if her emotions were really stirred her little heart might cease to beat
for twelve years i had to watch every word that any person uttered in any conversation and i had to head it off what the english call thingsoff love poverty crime religion and the rest of it
yes the first doctor that we had when she was carried off the ship at havre assured me that this must be done
good god are all these fellows monstrous idiots or is there a freemasonry between all of them from end to end of the earth
that is what makes me think of that fellow peire vidal
because of course his story is culture and i had to head her towards culture and at the same time it's so funny and she hadn't got to laugh and it's so full of love and she wasn't to think of love
do you know the story
las tours of the four castles had for chatelaine blanche somebodyorother who was called as a term of commendation la louvethe shewolf
and peire vidal the troubadour paid his court to la louve
and she wouldn't have anything to do with him
so out of compliment to herthe things people do when they're in lovehe dressed himself up in wolfskins and went up into the black mountains
and the shepherds of the montagne noire and their dogs mistook him for a wolf and he was torn with the fangs and beaten with clubs
so they carried him back to las tours and la louve wasn't at all impressed
they polished him up and her husband remonstrated seriously with her
vidal was you see a great poet and it was not proper to treat a great poet with indifference
so peire vidal declared himself emperor of jerusalem or somewhere and the husband had to kneel down and kiss his feet though la louve wouldn't
and peire set sail in a rowing boat with four companions to redeem the holy sepulchre
and they struck on a rock somewhere and at great expense the husband had to fit out an expedition to fetch him back
and peire vidal fell all over the lady's bed while the husband who was a most ferocious warrior remonstrated some more about the courtesy that is due to great poets
but i suppose la louve was the more ferocious of the two
anyhow that is all that came of it
isn't that a story
you haven't an idea of the queer oldfashionedness of florence's auntsthe misses hurlbird nor yet of her uncle
an extraordinarily lovable man that uncle john
thin gentle and with a heart that made his life very much what florence's afterwards became
he didn't reside at stamford his home was in waterbury where the watches come from
he had a factory there which in our queer american way would change its functions almost from year to year
for nine months or so it would manufacture buttons out of bone
then it would suddenly produce brass buttons for coachmen's liveries
then it would take a turn at embossed tin lids for candy boxes
the fact is that the poor old gentleman with his weak and fluttering heart didn't want his factory to manufacture anything at all
he wanted to retire
and he did retire when he was seventy
but he was so worried at having all the street boys in the town point after him and exclaim there goes the laziest man in waterbury
that he tried taking a tour round the world
and florence and a young man called jimmy went with him
it appears from what florence told me that jimmy's function with mr hurlbird was to avoid exciting topics for him
he had to keep him for instance out of political discussions
for the poor old man was a violent democrat in days when you might travel the world over without finding anything but a republican
anyhow they went round the world
i think an anecdote is about the best way to give you an idea of what the old gentleman was like
for it is perhaps important that you should know what the old gentleman was he had a great deal of influence in forming the character of my poor dear wife
just before they set out from san francisco for the south seas old mr hurlbird said he must take something with him to make little presents to people he met on the voyage
and it struck him that the things to take for that purpose were orangesbecause california is the orange countryand comfortable folding chairs
so he bought i don't know how many cases of orangesthe great cool california oranges and halfadozen folding chairs in a special case that he always kept in his cabin
there must have been half a cargo of fruit
for to every person on board the several steamers that they employedto every person with whom he had so much as a nodding acquaintance he gave an orange every morning
and they lasted him right round the girdle of this mighty globe of ours
when they were at north cape even he saw on the horizon poor dear thin man that he was a lighthouse
hello says he to himself these fellows must be very lonely
let's take them some oranges
so he had a boatload of his fruit out and had himself rowed to the lighthouse on the horizon
the folding chairs he lent to any lady that he came across and liked or who seemed tired and invalidish on the ship
and so guarded against his heart and having his niece with him he went round the world
he wasn't obtrusive about his heart
you wouldn't have known he had one
he only left it to the physical laboratory at waterbury for the benefit of science since he considered it to be quite an extraordinary kind of heart
and the joke of the matter was that when at the age of eightyfour just five days before poor florence he died of bronchitis there was found to be absolutely nothing the matter with that organ
it had certainly jumped or squeaked or something just sufficiently to take in the doctors but it appears that that was because of an odd formation of the lungs
i don't much understand about these matters
i inherited his money because florence died five days after him
i wish i hadn't
it was a great worry
i had to go out to waterbury just after florence's death because the poor dear old fellow had left a good many charitable bequests and i had to appoint trustees
i didn't like the idea of their not being properly handled
yes it was a great worry
and just as i had got things roughly settled i received the extraordinary cable from ashburnham begging me to come back and have a talk with him
and immediately afterwards came one from leonora saying yes please do come
you could be so helpful
it was as if he had sent the cable without consulting her and had afterwards told her
indeed that was pretty much what had happened except that he had told the girl and the girl told the wife
i arrived however too late to be of any good if i could have been of any good
and then i had my first taste of english life
it was amazing
it was overwhelming
i never shall forget the polished cob that edward beside me drove the animal's action its highstepping its skin that was like satin
and the peace
and the red cheeks
and the beautiful beautiful old house
just near branshaw teleragh it was and we descended on it from the high clear windswept waste of the new forest
i tell you it was amazing to arrive there from waterbury
and it came into my headfor teddy ashburnham you remember had cabled to me to come and have a talk with himthat it was unbelievable that anything essentially calamitous could happen to that place and those people
i tell you it was the very spirit of peace
and leonora beautiful and smiling with her coils of yellow hair stood on the top doorstep with a butler and footman and a maid or so behind her
and she just said so glad you've come as if i'd run down to lunch from a town ten miles away instead of having come half the world over at the call of two urgent telegrams
the girl was out with the hounds i think
and that poor devil beside me was in an agony
absolute hopeless dumb agony such as passes the mind of man to imagine
iii  it was a very hot summer in august  and florence had already been taking the baths for a month
i don't know how it feels to be a patient at one of those places
i never was a patient anywhere
i daresay the patients get a home feeling and some sort of anchorage in the spot
they seem to like the bath attendants with their cheerful faces their air of authority their white linen
but for myself to be at nauheim gave me a sensewhat shall i saya sense almost of nakednessthe nakedness that one feels on the seashore or in any great open space
i had no attachments no accumulations
in one's own home it is as if little innate sympathies draw one to particular chairs that seem to enfold one in an embrace or take one along particular streets that seem friendly when others may be hostile
and believe me that feeling is a very important part of life
i know it well that have been for so long a wanderer upon the face of public resorts
and one is too polished up
heaven knows i was never an untidy man
but the feeling that i had when whilst poor florence was taking her morning bath i stood upon the carefully swept steps of the englischer hof looking at the carefully arranged trees in tubs upon the carefully arranged gravel whilst carefully arranged people walked past in carefully calculated gaiety at the carefully calculated hour the tall trees of the public gardens going up to the right the reddish stone of the bathsor were they white halftimber chlets
upon my word i have forgotten i who was there so often
that will give you the measure of how much i was in the landscape
i could find my way blindfolded to the hot rooms to the douche rooms to the fountain in the centre of the quadrangle where the rusty water gushes out
yes i could find my way blindfolded
i know the exact distances
from the hotel regina you took one hundred and eightyseven paces then turning sharp lefthanded four hundred and twenty took you straight down to the fountain
from the englischer hof starting on the sidewalk it was ninetyseven paces and the same four hundred and twenty but turning lefthanded this time
and now you understand that having nothing in the world to dobut nothing whatever
i fell into the habit of counting my footsteps
i would walk with florence to the baths
and of course she entertained me with her conversation
it was as i have said wonderful what she could make conversation out of
she walked very lightly and her hair was very nicely done and she dressed beautifully and very expensively
of course she had money of her own but i shouldn't have minded
and yet you know i can't remember a single one of her dresses
or i can remember just one a very simple one of blue figured silka chinese patternvery full in the skirts and broadening out over the shoulders
and her hair was coppercoloured and the heels of her shoes were exceedingly high so that she tripped upon the points of her toes
and when she came to the door of the bathing place and when it opened to receive her she would look back at me with a little coquettish smile so that her cheek appeared to be caressing her shoulder
i seem to remember that with that dress she wore an immensely broad leghorn hatlike the chapeau de paille of rubens only very white
the hat would be tied with a lightly knotted scarf of the same stuff as her dress
she knew how to give value to her blue eyes
and round her neck would be some simple pink coral beads
and her complexion had a perfect clearness a perfect smoothness
yes that is how i most exactly remember her in that dress in that hat looking over her shoulder at me so that the eyes flashed very bluedark pebble blue  and what the devil
for whose benefit did she do it
for that of the bath attendant
of the passersby
i don't know
anyhow it can't have been for me for never in all the years of her life never on any possible occasion or in any other place did she so smile to me mockingly invitingly
ah she was a riddle but then all other women are riddles
and it occurs to me that some way back i began a sentence that i have never finished
it was about the feeling that i had when i stood on the steps of my hotel every morning before starting out to fetch florence back from the bath
natty precise wellbrushed conscious of being rather small amongst the long english the lank americans the rotund germans and the obese russian jewesses i should stand there tapping a cigarette on the outside of my case surveying for a moment the world in the sunlight
but a day was to come when i was never to do it again alone
you can imagine therefore what the coming of the ashburnhams meant to me
i have forgotten the aspect of many things but i shall never forget the aspect of the diningroom of the hotel excelsior on that eveningand on so many other evenings
whole castles have vanished from my memory whole cities that i have never visited again but that white room festooned with papiermach fruits and flowers the tall windows the many tables the black screen round the door with three golden cranes flying upward on each panel the palmtree in the centre of the room the swish of the waiter's feet the cold expensive elegance the mien of the diners as they came in every eveningtheir air of earnestness as if they must go through a meal prescribed by the kur authorities and their air of sobriety as if they must seek not by any means to enjoy their mealsthose things i shall not easily forget
and then one evening in the twilight i saw edward ashburnham lounge round the screen into the room
the head waiter a man with a face all greyin what subterranean nooks or corners do people cultivate those absolutely grey complexionswent with the timorous patronage of these creatures towards him and held out a grey ear to be whispered into
it was generally a disagreeable ordeal for newcomers but edward ashburnham bore it like an englishman and a gentleman
i could see his lips form a word of three syllablesremember i had nothing in the world to do but to notice these nicetiesand immediately i knew that he must be edward ashburnham captain fourteenth hussars of branshaw house branshaw teleragh
i knew it because every evening just before dinner whilst i waited in the hall i used by the courtesy of monsieur schontz the proprietor to inspect the little police reports that each guest was expected to sign upon taking a room
the head waiter piloted him immediately to a vacant table three away from my ownthe table that the grenfalls of falls river nj had just vacated
it struck me that that was not a very nice table for the newcomers since the sunlight low though it was shone straight down upon it and the same idea seemed to come at the same moment into captain ashburnham's head
his face hitherto had in the wonderful english fashion expressed nothing whatever
nothing
there was in it neither joy nor despair neither hope nor fear neither boredom nor satisfaction
he seemed to perceive no soul in that crowded room he might have been walking in a jungle
i never came across such a perfect expression before and i never shall again
it was insolence and not insolence it was modesty and not modesty
his hair was fair extraordinarily ordered in a wave running from the left temple to the right his face was a light brickred perfectly uniform in tint up to the roots of the hair itself his yellow moustache was as stiff as a toothbrush and i verily believe that he had his black smoking jacket thickened a little over the shoulderblades so as to give himself the air of the slightest possible stoop
it would be like him to do that that was the sort of thing he thought about
martingales chiffney bits boots where you got the best soap the best brandy the name of the chap who rode a plater down the khyber cliffs the spreading power of number three shot before a charge of number four powder by heavens i hardly ever heard him talk of anything else
not in all the years that i knew him did i hear him talk of anything but these subjects
oh yes once he told me that i could buy my special shade of blue ties cheaper from a firm in burlington arcade than from my own people in new york
and i have bought my ties from that firm ever since
otherwise i should not remember the name of the burlington arcade
i wonder what it looks like
i have never seen it
i imagine it to be two immense rows of pillars like those of the forum at rome with edward ashburnham striding down between them
but it probably isn'tthe least like that
once also he advised me to buy caledonian deferred since they were due to rise
and i did buy them and they did rise
but of how he got the knowledge i haven't the faintest idea
it seemed to drop out of the blue sky
and that was absolutely all that i knew of him until a month agothat and the profusion of his cases all of pigskin and stamped with his initials e f a
there were gun cases and collar cases and shirt cases and letter cases and cases each containing four bottles of medicine and hat cases and helmet cases
it must have needed a whole herd of the gadarene swine to make up his outfit
and if i ever penetrated into his private room it would be to see him standing with his coat and waistcoat off and the immensely long line of his perfectly elegant trousers from waist to boot heel
and he would have a slightly reflective air and he would be just opening one kind of case and just closing another
good god what did they all see in him
for i swear there was all there was of him inside and out though they said he was a good soldier
yet leonora adored him with a passion that was like an agony and hated him with an agony that was as bitter as the sea
how could he arouse anything like a sentiment in anybody
what did he even talk to them aboutwhen they were under four eyesah well suddenly as if by a flash of inspiration i know
for all good soldiers are sentimentalistsall good soldiers of that type
their profession for one thing is full of the big words courage loyalty honour constancy
and i have given a wrong impression of edward ashburnham if i have made you think that literally never in the course of our nine years of intimacy did he discuss what he would have called the graver things
even before his final outburst to me at times very late at night say he has blurted out something that gave an insight into the sentimental view of the cosmos that was his
he would say how much the society of a good woman could do towards redeeming you and he would say that constancy was the finest of the virtues
he said it very stiffly of course but still as if the statement admitted of no doubt
constancy
isn't that the queer thought
and yet i must add that poor dear edward was a great readerhe would pass hours lost in novels of a sentimental typenovels in which typewriter girls married marquises and governesses earls
and in his books as a rule the course of true love ran as smooth as buttered honey
and he was fond of poetry of a certain typeand he could even read a perfectly sad love story
i have seen his eyes filled with tears at reading of a hopeless parting
and he loved with a sentimental yearning all children puppies and the feeble generally 
so you see he would have plenty to gurgle about to a womanwith that and his sound common sense about martingales and hisstill sentimentalexperiences as a county magistrate and with his intense optimistic belief that the woman he was making love to at the moment was the one he was destined at last to be eternally constant to well i fancy he could put up a pretty good deal of talk when there was no man around to make him feel shy
and i was quite astonished during his final burst out to meat the very end of things when the poor girl was on her way to that fatal brindisi and he was trying to persuade himself and me that he had never really cared for heri was quite astonished to observe how literary and how just his expressions were
he talked like quite a good booka book not in the least cheaply sentimental
you see i suppose he regarded me not so much as a man
i had to be regarded as a woman or a solicitor
anyhow it burst out of him on that horrible night
and then next morning he took me over to the assizes and i saw how in a perfectly calm and businesslike way he set to work to secure a verdict of not guilty for a poor girl the daughter of one of his tenants who had been accused of murdering her baby
he spent two hundred pounds on her defence well that was edward ashburnham
i had forgotten about his eyes
they were as blue as the sides of a certain type of box of matches
when you looked at them carefully you saw that they were perfectly honest perfectly straightforward perfectly perfectly stupid
but the brick pink of his complexion running perfectly level to the brick pink of his inner eyelids gave them a curious sinister expressionlike a mosaic of blue porcelain set in pink china
and that chap coming into a room snapped up the gaze of every woman in it as dexterously as a conjurer pockets billiard balls
it was most amazing
you know the man on the stage who throws up sixteen balls at once and they all drop into pockets all over his person on his shoulders on his heels on the inner side of his sleeves and he stands perfectly still and does nothing
well it was like that
he had rather a rough hoarse voice
and there he was standing by the table
i was looking at him with my back to the screen
and suddenly i saw two distinct expressions flicker across his immobile eyes
how the deuce did they do it those unflinching blue eyes with the direct gaze
for the eyes themselves never moved gazing over my shoulder towards the screen
and the gaze was perfectly level and perfectly direct and perfectly unchanging
i suppose that the lids really must have rounded themselves a little and perhaps the lips moved a little too as if he should be saying there you are my dear
at any rate the expression was that of pride of satisfaction of the possessor
i saw him once afterwards for a moment gaze upon the sunny fields of branshaw and say all this is my land
and then again the gaze was perhaps more direct harder if possiblehardy too
it was a measuring look a challenging look
once when we were at wiesbaden watching him play in a polo match against the bonner hussaren i saw the same look come into his eyes balancing the possibilities looking over the ground
the german captain count baron idigon von lelffel was right up by their goal posts coming with the ball in an easy canter in that tricky german fashion
the rest of the field were just anywhere
it was only a scratch sort of affair
ashburnham was quite close to the rails not five yards from us and i heard him saying to himself might just be done
and he did it
goodness
he swung that pony round with all its four legs spread out like a cat dropping off a roof  well it was just that look that i noticed in his eyes it might i seem even now to hear him muttering to himself just be done
i looked round over my shoulder and saw tall smiling brilliantly and buoyantleonora
and little and fair and as radiant as the track of sunlight along the seamy wife
that poor wretch
to think that he was at that moment in a perfect devil of a fix and there he was saying at the back of his mind it might just be done
it was like a chap in the middle of the eruption of a volcano saying that he might just manage to bolt into the tumult and set fire to a haystack
madness
predestination
who the devil knows
mrs ashburnham exhibited at that moment more gaiety than i have ever since known her to show
there are certain classes of english peoplethe nicer ones when they have been to many spas who seem to make a point of becoming much more than usually animated when they are introduced to my compatriots
i have noticed this often
of course they must first have accepted the americans
but that once done they seem to say to themselves hallo these women are so bright
we aren't going to be outdone in brightness
and for the time being they certainly aren't
but it wears off
so it was with leonoraat least until she noticed me
she began leonora didand perhaps it was that that gave me the idea of a touch of insolence in her character for she never afterwards did any one single thing like itshe began by saying in quite a loud voice and from quite a distance  don't stop over by that stuffy old table teddy
come and sit by these nice people
and that was an extraordinary thing to say
quite extraordinary
i couldn't for the life of me refer to total strangers as nice people
but of course she was taking a line of her own in which i at any rateand no one else in the room for she too had taken the trouble to read through the list of guestscounted any more than so many clean bull terriers
and she sat down rather brilliantly at a vacant table beside oursone that was reserved for the guggenheimers
and she just sat absolutely deaf to the remonstrances of the head waiter with his face like a grey ram's
that poor chap was doing his steadfast duty too
he knew that the guggenheimers of chicago after they had stayed there a month and had worried the poor life out of him would give him two dollars fifty and grumble at the tipping system
and he knew that teddy ashburnham and his wife would give him no trouble whatever except what the smiles of leonora might cause in his apparently unimpressionable bosomthough you never can tell what may go on behind even a not quite spotless plastronand every week edward ashburnham would give him a solid sound golden english sovereign
yet this stout fellow was intent on saving that table for the guggenheimers of chicago
it ended in florence saying  why shouldn't we all eat out of the same troughthat's a nasty new york saying
but i'm sure we're all nice quiet people and there can be four seats at our table
it's round
then came as it were an appreciative gurgle from the captain and i was perfectly aware of a slight hesitationa quick sharp motion in mrs ashburnham as if her horse had checked
but she put it at the fence all right rising from the seat she had taken and sitting down opposite me as it were all in one motion
i never thought that leonora looked her best in evening dress
she seemed to get it too clearly cut there was no ruffling
she always affected black and her shoulders were too classical
she seemed to stand out of her corsage as a white marble bust might out of a black wedgwood vase
i don't know
i loved leonora always and today i would very cheerfully lay down my life what is left of it in her service
but i am sure i never had the beginnings of a trace of what is called the sex instinct towards her
and i supposeno i am certain that she never had it towards me
as far as i am concerned i think it was those white shoulders that did it
i seemed to feel when i looked at them that if ever i should press my lips upon them that they would be slightly coldnot icily not without a touch of human heat but as they say of baths with the chill off
i seemed to feel chilled at the end of my lips when i looked at her  no leonora always appeared to me at her best in a blue tailormade
then her glorious hair wasn't deadened by her white shoulders
certain women's lines guide your eyes to their necks their eyelashes their lips their breasts
but leonora's seemed to conduct your gaze always to her wrist
and the wrist was at its best in a black or a dogskin glove and there was always a gold circlet with a little chain supporting a very small golden key to a dispatch box
perhaps it was that in which she locked up her heart and her feelings
anyhow she sat down opposite me and then for the first time she paid any attention to my existence
she gave me suddenly yet deliberately one long stare
her eyes too were blue and dark and the eyelids were so arched that they gave you the whole round of the irises
and it was a most remarkable a most moving glance as if for a moment a lighthouse had looked at me
i seemed to perceive the swift questions chasing each other through the brain that was behind them
i seemed to hear the brain ask and the eyes answer with all the simpleness of a woman who was a good hand at taking in qualities of a horseas indeed she was
stands well has plenty of room for his oats behind the girth
not so much in the way of shoulders and so on
and so her eyes asked is this man trustworthy in money matters is he likely to try to play the lover is he likely to let his women be troublesome
is he above all likely to babble about my affairs
and suddenly into those cold slightly defiant almost defensive china blue orbs there came a warmth a tenderness a friendly recognition oh it was very charming and very touchingand quite mortifying
it was the look of a mother to her son of a sister to her brother
it implied trust it implied the want of any necessity for barriers
by god she looked at me as if i were an invalidas any kind woman may look at a poor chap in a bath chair
and yes from that day forward she always treated me and not florence as if i were the invalid
why she would run after me with a rug upon chilly days
i suppose therefore that her eyes had made a favourable answer
or perhaps it wasn't a favourable answer
and then florence said and so the whole round table is begun
again edward ashburnham gurgled slightly in his throat but leonora shivered a little as if a goose had walked over her grave
and i was passing her the nickelsilver basket of rolls
avanti
iv  so began those nine years of uninterrupted tranquillity
they were characterized by an extraordinary want of any communicativeness on the part of the ashburnhams to which we on our part replied by leaving out quite as extraordinarily and nearly as completely the personal note
indeed you may take it that what characterized our relationship was an atmosphere of taking everything for granted
the given proposition was that we were all good people
we took for granted that we all liked beef underdone but not too underdone that both men preferred a good liqueur brandy after lunch that both women drank a very light rhine wine qualified with fachingen waterthat sort of thing
it was also taken for granted that we were both sufficiently well off to afford anything that we could reasonably want in the way of amusements fitting to our stationthat we could take motor cars and carriages by the day that we could give each other dinners and dine our friends and we could indulge if we liked in economy
thus florence was in the habit of having the daily telegraph sent to her every day from london
she was always an anglomaniac was florence the paris edition of the new york herald was always good enough for me
but when we discovered that the ashburnhams' copy of the london paper followed them from england leonora and florence decided between them to suppress one subscription one year and the other the next
similarly it was the habit of the grand duke of nassau schwerin who came yearly to the baths to dine once with about eighteen families of regular kur guests
in return he would give a dinner of all the eighteen at once
and since these dinners were rather expensive you had to take the grand duke and a good many of his suite and any members of the diplomatic bodies that might be thereflorence and leonora putting their heads together didn't see why we shouldn't give the grand duke his dinner together
and so we did
i don't suppose the serenity minded that economy or even noticed it
at any rate our joint dinner to the royal personage gradually assumed the aspect of a yearly function
indeed it grew larger and larger until it became a sort of closing function for the season at any rate as far as we were concerned
i don't in the least mean to say that we were the sort of persons who aspired to mix with royalty
we didn't we hadn't any claims we were just good people
but the grand duke was a pleasant affable sort of royalty like the late king edward vii and it was pleasant to hear him talk about the races and very occasionally as a bonne bouche about his nephew the emperor or to have him pause for a moment in his walk to ask after the progress of our cures or to be benignantly interested in the amount of money we had put on lelffel's hunter for the frankfurt welter stakes
but upon my word i don't know how we put in our time
how does one put in one's time
how is it possible to have achieved nine years and to have nothing whatever to show for it
nothing whatever you understand
not so much as a bone penholder carved to resemble a chessman and with a hole in the top through which you could see four views of nauheim
and as for experience as for knowledge of one's fellow beingsnothing either
upon my word i couldn't tell you offhand whether the lady who sold the so expensive violets at the bottom of the road that leads to the station was cheating me or no i can't say whether the porter who carried our traps across the station at leghorn was a thief or no when he said that the regular tariff was a lira a parcel
the instances of honesty that one comes across in this world are just as amazing as the instances of dishonesty
after fortyfive years of mixing with one's kind one ought to have acquired the habit of being able to know something about one's fellow beings
but one doesn't
i think the modern civilized habitthe modern english habit of taking every one for grantedis a good deal to blame for this
i have observed this matter long enough to know the queer subtle thing that it is to know how the faculty for what it is worth never lets you down
mind i am not saying that this is not the most desirable type of life in the world that it is not an almost unreasonably high standard
for it is really nauseating when you detest it to have to eat every day several slices of thin tepid pink india rubber and it is disagreeable to have to drink brandy when you would prefer to be cheered up by warm sweet kmmel
and it is nasty to have to take a cold bath in the morning when what you want is really a hot one at night
and it stirs a little of the faith of your fathers that is deep down within you to have to have it taken for granted that you are an episcopalian when really you are an oldfashioned philadelphia quaker
but these things have to be done it is the cock that the whole of this society owes to sculapius
and the odd queer thing is that the whole collection of rules applies to anybodyto the anybodies that you meet in hotels in railway trains to a less degree perhaps in steamers but even in the end upon steamers
you meet a man or a woman and from tiny and intimate sounds from the slightest of movements you know at once whether you are concerned with good people or with those who won't do
you know this is to say whether they will go rigidly through with the whole programme from the underdone beef to the anglicanism
it won't matter whether they be short or tall whether the voice squeak like a marionette or rumble like a town bull's it won't matter whether they are germans austrians french spanish or even braziliansthey will be the germans or brazilians who take a cold bath every morning and who move roughly speaking in diplomatic circles
but the inconvenientwell hang it all i will say itthe damnable nuisance of the whole thing is that with all the taking for granted you never really get an inch deeper than the things i have catalogued
i can give you a rather extraordinary instance of this
i can't remember whether it was in our first yearthe first year of us four at nauheim because of course it would have been the fourth year of florence and myselfbut it must have been in the first or second year
and that gives the measure at once of the extraordinariness of our discussion and of the swiftness with which intimacy had grown up between us
on the one hand we seemed to start out on the expedition so naturally and with so little preparation that it was as if we must have made many such excursions before and our intimacy seemed so deep
yet the place to which we went was obviously one to which florence at least would have wanted to take us quite early so that you would almost think we should have gone there together at the beginning of our intimacy
florence was singularly expert as a guide to archaeological expeditions and there was nothing she liked so much as taking people round ruins and showing you the window from which some one looked down upon the murder of some one else
she only did it once but she did it quite magnificently
she could find her way with the sole help of baedeker as easily about any old monument as she could about any american city where the blocks are all square and the streets all numbered so that you can go perfectly easily from twentyfourth to thirtieth
now it happens that fifty minutes away from nauheim by a good train is the ancient city of m upon a great pinnacle of basalt girt with a triple road running sideways up its shoulder like a scarf
and at the top there is a castlenot a square castle like windsor but a castle all slate gables and high peaks with gilt weathercocks flashing bravelythe castle of st elizabeth of hungary
it has the disadvantage of being in prussia and it is always disagreeable to go into that country but it is very old and there are many doublespired churches and it stands up like a pyramid out of the green valley of the lahn
i don't suppose the ashburnhams wanted especially to go there and i didn't especially want to go there myself
but you understand there was no objection
it was part of the cure to make an excursion three or four times a week
so that we were all quite unanimous in being grateful to florence for providing the motive power
florence of course had a motive of her own
she was at that time engaged in educating captain ashburnhamoh of course quite pour le bon motif
she used to say to leonora i simply can't understand how you can let him live by your side and be so ignorant
leonora herself always struck me as being remarkably well educated
at any rate she knew beforehand all that florence had to tell her
perhaps she got it up out of baedeker before florence was up in the morning
i don't mean to say that you would ever have known that leonora knew anything but if florence started to tell us how ludwig the courageous wanted to have three wives at oncein which he differed from henry viii who wanted them one after the other and this caused a good deal of troubleif florence started to tell us this leonora would just nod her head in a way that quite pleasantly rattled my poor wife
she used to exclaim well if you knew it why haven't you told it all already to captain ashburnham
i'm sure he finds it interesting
and leonora would look reflectively at her husband and say i have an idea that it might injure his handthe hand you know used in connection with horses' mouths and poor ashburnham would blush and mutter and would say that's all right
don't you bother about me
i fancy his wife's irony did quite alarm poor teddy because one evening he asked me seriously in the smokingroom if i thought that having too much in one's head would really interfere with one's quickness in polo
it struck him he said that brainy johnnies generally were rather muffs when they got on to four legs
i reassured him as best i could
i told him that he wasn't likely to take in enough to upset his balance
at that time the captain was quite evidently enjoying being educated by florence
she used to do it about three or four times a week under the approving eyes of leonora and myself
it wasn't you understand systematic
it came in bursts
it was florence clearing up one of the dark places of the earth leaving the world a little lighter than she had found it
she would tell him the story of hamlet explain the form of a symphony humming the first and second subjects to him and so on she would explain to him the difference between arminians and erastians or she would give him a short lecture on the early history of the united states
and it was done in a way well calculated to arrest a young attention
did you ever read mrs markham
well it was like that 
but our excursion to m was a much larger a much more full dress affair
you see in the archives of the schloss in that city there was a document which florence thought would finally give her the chance to educate the whole lot of us together
it really worried poor florence that she couldn't in matters of culture ever get the better of leonora
i don't know what leonora knew or what she didn't know but certainly she was always there whenever florence brought out any information
and she gave somehow the impression of really knowing what poor florence gave the impression of having only picked up
i can't exactly define it
it was almost something physical
have you ever seen a retriever dashing in play after a greyhound
you see the two running over a green field almost side by side and suddenly the retriever makes a friendly snap at the other
and the greyhound simply isn't there
you haven't observed it quicken its speed or strain a limb but there it is just two yards in front of the retriever's outstretched muzzle
so it was with florence and leonora in matters of culture
but on this occasion i knew that something was up
i found florence some days before reading books like ranke's history of the popes symonds' renaissance motley's rise of the dutch republic and luther's table talk
i must say that until the astonishment came i got nothing but pleasure out of the little expedition
i like catching the twoforty i like the slow smooth roll of the great big trainsand they are the best trains in the world
i like being drawn through the green country and looking at it through the clear glass of the great windows
though of course the country isn't really green
the sun shines the earth is blood red and purple and red and green and red
and the oxen in the ploughlands are bright varnished brown and black and blackish purple and the peasants are dressed in the black and white of magpies and there are great rocks of magpies too
or the peasants' dresses in another field where there are little mounds of hay that will be greygreen on the sunny side and purple in the shadowsthe peasants' dresses are vermilion with emerald green ribbons and purple skirts and white shirts and black velvet stomachers
still the impression is that you are drawn through brilliant green meadows that run away on each side to the dark purple firwoods the basalt pinnacles the immense forests
and there is meadowsweet at the edge of the streams and cattle
why i remember on that afternoon i saw a brown cow hitch its horns under the stomach of a black and white animal and the black and white one was thrown right into the middle of a narrow stream
i burst out laughing
but florence was imparting information so hard and leonora was listening so intently that no one noticed me
as for me i was pleased to be off duty i was pleased to think that florence for the moment was indubitably out of mischiefbecause she was talking about ludwig the courageous i think it was ludwig the courageous but i am not an historian about ludwig the courageous of hessen who wanted to have three wives at once and patronized luthersomething like thati was so relieved to be off duty because she couldn't possibly be doing anything to excite herself or set her poor heart aflutteringthat the incident of the cow was a real joy to me
i chuckled over it from time to time for the whole rest of the day
because it does look very funny you know to see a black and white cow land on its back in the middle of a stream
it is so just exactly what one doesn't expect of a cow
i suppose i ought to have pitied the poor animal but i just didn't
i was out for enjoyment
and i just enjoyed myself
it is so pleasant to be drawn along in front of the spectacular towns with the peaked castles and the many double spires
in the sunlight gleams come from the citygleams from the glass of windows from the gilt signs of apothecaries from the ensigns of the student corps high up in the mountains from the helmets of the funny little soldiers moving their stiff little legs in white linen trousers
and it was pleasant to get out in the great big spectacular prussian station with the hammered bronze ornaments and the paintings of peasants and flowers and cows and to hear florence bargain energetically with the driver of an ancient droschka drawn by two lean horses
of course i spoke german much more correctly than florence though i never could rid myself quite of the accent of the pennsylvania duitsch of my childhood
anyhow we were drawn in a sort of triumph for five marks without any trinkgeld right up to the castle
and we were taken through the museum and saw the firebacks the old glass the old swords and the antique contraptions
and we went up winding corkscrew staircases and through the rittersaal the great painted hall where the reformer and his friends met for the first time under the protection of the gentleman that had three wives at once and formed an alliance with the gentleman that had six wives one after the other i'm not really interested in these facts but they have a bearing on my story
and we went through chapels and music rooms right up immensely high in the air to a large old chamber full of presses with heavilyshuttered windows all round
and florence became positively electric
she told the tired bored custodian what shutters to open so that the bright sunlight streamed in palpable shafts into the dim old chamber
she explained that this was luther's bedroom and that just where the sunlight fell had stood his bed
as a matter of fact i believe that she was wrong and that luther only stopped as it were for lunch in order to evade pursuit
but no doubt it would have been his bedroom if he could have been persuaded to stop the night
and then in spite of the protest of the custodian she threw open another shutter and came tripping back to a large glass case
and there she exclaimed with an accent of gaiety of triumph and of audacity
she was pointing at a piece of paper like the halfsheet of a letter with some faint pencil scrawls that might have been a jotting of the amounts we were spending during the day
and i was extremely happy at her gaiety in her triumph in her audacity
captain ashburnham had his hands upon the glass case
there it isthe protest
and then as we all properly stagemanaged our bewilderment she continued don't you know that is why we were all called protestants
that is the pencil draft of the protest they drew up
you can see the signatures of martin luther and martin bucer and zwingli and ludwig the courageous  i may have got some of the names wrong but i know that luther and bucer were there
and her animation continued and i was glad
she was better and she was out of mischief
she continued looking up into captain ashburnham's eyes it's because of that piece of paper that you're honest sober industrious provident and cleanlived
if it weren't for that piece of paper you'd be like the irish or the italians or the poles but particularly the irish  and she laid one finger upon captain ashburnham's wrist
i was aware of something treacherous something frightful something evil in the day
i can't define it and can't find a simile for it
it wasn't as if a snake had looked out of a hole
no it was as if my heart had missed a beat
it was as if we were going to run and cry out all four of us in separate directions averting our heads
in ashburnham's face i know that there was absolute panic
i was horribly frightened and then i discovered that the pain in my left wrist was caused by leonora's clutching it  i can't stand this she said with a most extraordinary passion i must get out of this
i was horribly frightened
it came to me for a moment though i hadn't time to think it that she must be a madly jealous womanjealous of florence and captain ashburnham of all people in the world
and it was a panic in which we fled
we went right down the winding stairs across the immense rittersaal to a little terrace that overlooks the lahn the broad valley and the immense plain into which it opens out
don't you see
she said don't you see what's going on
the panic again stopped my heart
i muttered i stutteredi don't know how i got the words out  no
what's the matter
whatever's the matter
she looked me straight in the eyes and for a moment i had the feeling that those two blue discs were immense were overwhelming were like a wall of blue that shut me off from the rest of the world
i know it sounds absurd but that is what it did feel like
don't you see she said with a really horrible bitterness with a really horrible lamentation in her voice don't you see that that's the cause of the whole miserable affair of the whole sorrow of the world
and of the eternal damnation of you and me and them   i don't remember how she went on i was too frightened i was too amazed
i think i was thinking of running to fetch assistancea doctor perhaps or captain ashburnham
or possibly she needed florence's tender care though of course it would have been very bad for florence's heart
but i know that when i came out of it she was saying oh where are all the bright happy innocent beings in the world
where's happiness
one reads of it in books
she ran her hand with a singular clawing motion upwards over her forehead
her eyes were enormously distended her face was exactly that of a person looking into the pit of hell and seeing horrors there
and then suddenly she stopped
she was most amazingly just mrs ashburnham again
her face was perfectly clear sharp and defined her hair was glorious in its golden coils
her nostrils twitched with a sort of contempt
she appeared to look with interest at a gypsy caravan that was coming over a little bridge far below us
don't you know she said in her clear hard voice don't you know that i'm an irish catholic
v  those words gave me the greatest relief that i have ever had in my life
they told me i think almost more than i have ever gathered at any one momentabout myself
i don't think that before that day i had ever wanted anything very much except florence
i have of course had appetites impatiences why sometimes at a table d'hte when there would be say caviare handed round i have been absolutely full of impatience for fear that when the dish came to me there should not be a satisfying portion left over by the other guests
i have been exceedingly impatient at missing trains
the belgian state railway has a trick of letting the french trains miss their connections at brussels
that has always infuriated me
i have written about it letters to the times that the times never printed those that i wrote to the paris edition of the new york herald were always printed but they never seemed to satisfy me when i saw them
well that was a sort of frenzy with me
it was a frenzy that now i can hardly realize
i can understand it intellectually
you see in those days i was interested in people with hearts
there was florence there was edward ashburnhamor perhaps it was leonora that i was more interested in
i don't mean in the way of love
but you see we were both of the same professionat any rate as i saw it
and the profession was that of keeping heart patients alive
you have no idea how engrossing such a profession may become
just as the blacksmith says by hammer and hand all art doth stand just as the baker thinks that all the solar system revolves around his morning delivery of rolls as the postmastergeneral believes that he alone is the preserver of societyand surely surely these delusions are necessary to keep us goingso did i and as i believed leonora imagine that the whole world ought to be arranged so as to ensure the keeping alive of heart patients
you have no idea how engrossing such a profession may becomehow imbecile in view of that engrossment appear the ways of princes of republics of municipalities
a rough bit of road beneath the motor tyres a couple of succeeding thank'eemarms with their quick jolts would be enough to set me grumbling to leonora against the prince or the grand duke or the free city through whose territory we might be passing
i would grumble like a stockbroker whose conversations over the telephone are incommoded by the ringing of bells from a city church
i would talk about medieval survivals about the taxes being surely high enough
the point by the way about the missing of the connections of the calais boat trains at brussels was that the shortest possible sea journey is frequently of great importance to sufferers from the heart
now on the continent there are two special heart cure places nauheim and spa and to reach both of these baths from england if in order to ensure a short sea passage you come by calaisyou have to make the connection at brussels
and the belgian train never waits by so much the shade of a second for the one coming from calais or from paris
and even if the french train are just on time you have to runimagine a heart patient runningalong the unfamiliar ways of the brussels station and to scramble up the high steps of the moving train
or if you miss connection you have to wait five or six hours
i used to keep awake whole nights cursing that abuse
my wife used to runshe never in whatever else she may have misled me tried to give me the impression that she was not a gallant soul
but once in the german express she would lean back with one hand to her side and her eyes closed
well she was a good actress
and i would be in hell
in hell i tell you
for in florence i had at once a wife and an unattained mistressthat is what it comes toand in the retaining of her in this world i had my occupation my career my ambition
it is not often that these things are united in one body
leonora was a good actress too
by jove she was good
i tell you she would listen to me by the hour evolving my plans for a shockproof world
it is true that at times i used to notice about her an air of inattention as if she were listening a mother to the child at her knee or as if precisely i were myself the patient
you understand that there was nothing the matter with edward ashburnham's heartthat he had thrown up his commission and had left india and come half the world over in order to follow a woman who had really had a heart to nauheim
that was the sort of sentimental ass he was
for you understand too that they really needed to live in india to economize to let the house at branshaw teleragh
of course at that date i had never heard of the kilsyte case
ashburnham had you know kissed a servant girl in a railway train and it was only the grace of god the prompt functioning of the communication cord and the ready sympathy of what i believe you call the hampshire bench that kept the poor devil out of winchester gaol for years and years
i never heard of that case until the final stages of leonora's revelations
but just think of that poor wretch
i who have surely the right beg you to think of that poor wretch
is it possible that such a luckless devil should be so tormented by blind and inscrutable destiny
for there is no other way to think of it
none
i have the right to say it since for years he was my wife's lover since he killed her since he broke up all the pleasantnesses that there were in my life
there is no priest that has the right to tell me that i must not ask pity for him from you silent listener beyond the hearthstone from the world or from the god who created in him those desires those madnesses  of course i should not hear of the kilsyte case
i knew none of their friends they were for me just good peoplefortunate people with broad and sunny acres in a southern county
just good people
by heavens i sometimes think that it would have been better for him poor dear if the case had been such a one that i must needs have heard of itsuch a one as maids and couriers and other kur guests whisper about for years after until gradually it dies away in the pity that there is knocking about here and there in the world
supposing he had spent his seven years in winchester gaol or whatever it is that inscrutable and blind justice allots to you for following your natural but illtimed inclinationsthere would have arrived a stage when nodding gossips on the kursaal terrace would have said poor fellow thinking of his ruined career
he would have been the fine soldier with his back now bent
better for him poor devil if his back had been prematurely bent
why it would have been a thousand times better for of course the kilsyte case which came at the very beginning of his finding leonora cold and unsympathetic gave him a nasty jar
he left servants alone after that
it turned him naturally all the more loose amongst women of his own class
why leonora told me that mrs maidanthe woman he followed from burma to nauheimassured her he awakened her attention by swearing that when he kissed the servant in the train he was driven to it
i daresay he was driven to it by the mad passion to find an ultimately satisfying woman
i daresay he was sincere enough
heaven help me i daresay he was sincere enough in his love for mrs maidan
she was a nice little thing a dear little dark woman with long lashes of whom florence grew quite fond
she had a lisp and a happy smile
we saw plenty of her for the first month of our acquaintance then she died quite quietlyof heart trouble
but you know poor little mrs maidanshe was so gentle so young
she cannot have been more than twentythree and she had a boy husband out in chitral not more than twentyfour i believe
such young things ought to have been left alone
of course ashburnham could not leave her alone
i do not believe that he could
why even i at this distance of time am aware that i am a little in love with her memory
i can't help smiling when i think suddenly of heras you might at the thought of something wrapped carefully away in lavender in some drawer in some old house that you have long left
she was soso submissive
why even to me she had the air of being submissiveto me that not the youngest child will ever pay heed to
yes this is the saddest story  no i cannot help wishing that florence had left her alonewith her playing with adultery
i suppose it was though she was such a child that one has the impression that she would hardly have known how to spell such a word
no it was just submissivenessto the importunities to the tempestuous forces that pushed that miserable fellow on to ruin
and i do not suppose that florence really made much difference
if it had not been for her that ashburnham left his allegiance for mrs maidan then it would have been some other woman
but still i do not know
perhaps the poor young thing would have diedshe was bound to die anyhow quite soonbut she would have died without having to soak her noonday pillow with tears whilst florence below the window talked to captain ashburnham about the constitution of the united states
yes it would have left a better taste in the mouth if florence had let her die in peace  leonora behaved better in a sense
she just boxed mrs maidan's earsyes she hit her in an uncontrollable access of rage a hard blow on the side of the cheek in the corridor of the hotel outside edward's rooms
it was that you know that accounted for the sudden odd intimacy that sprang up between florence and mrs ashburnham
because it was of course an odd intimacy
if you look at it from the outside nothing could have been more unlikely than that leonora who is the proudest creature on god's earth would have struck up an acquaintanceship with two casual yankees whom she could not really have regarded as being much more than a carpet beneath her feet
you may ask what she had to be proud of
well she was a powys married to an ashburnhami suppose that gave her the right to despise casual americans as long as she did it unostentatiously
i don't know what anyone has to be proud of
she might have taken pride in her patience in her keeping her husband out of the bankruptcy court
perhaps she did
at any rate that was how florence got to know her
she came round a screen at the corner of the hotel corridor and found leonora with the gold key that hung from her wrist caught in mrs maidan's hair just before dinner
there was not a single word spoken
little mrs maidan was very pale with a red mark down her left cheek and the key would not come out of her black hair
it was florence who had to disentangle it for leonora was in such a state that she could not have brought herself to touch mrs maidan without growing sick
and there was not a word spoken
you see under those four eyesher own and mrs maidan'sleonora could just let herself go as far as to box mrs maidan's ears
but the moment a stranger came along she pulled herself wonderfully up
she was at first silent and then the moment the key was disengaged by florence she was in a state to say so awkward of me
i was just trying to put the comb straight in mrs maidan's hair  mrs maidan however was not a powys married to an ashburnham she was a poor little o'flaherty whose husband was a boy of country parsonage origin
so there was no mistaking the sob she let go as she went desolately away along the corridor
but leonora was still going to play up
she opened the door of ashburnham's room quite ostentatiously so that florence should hear her address edward in terms of intimacy and liking
edward she called
but there was no edward there
you understand that there was no edward there
it was then for the only time of her career that leonora really compromised herselfshe exclaimed how frightful
poor little maisie
she caught herself up at that but of course it was too late
it was a queer sort of affair
i want to do leonora every justice
i love her very dearly for one thing and in this matter which was certainly the ruin of my small household cockleshell she certainly tripped up
i do not believeand leonora herself does not believethat poor little maisie maidan was ever edward's mistress
her heart was really so bad that she would have succumbed to anything like an impassioned embrace
that is the plain english of it and i suppose plain english is best
she was really what the other two for reasons of their own just pretended to be
queer isn't it
like one of those sinister jokes that providence plays upon one
add to this that i do not suppose that leonora would much have minded at any other moment if mrs maidan had been her husband's mistress
it might have been a relief from edward's sentimental gurglings over the lady and from the lady's submissive acceptance of those sounds
no she would not have minded
but in boxing mrs maidan's ears leonora was just striking the face of an intolerable universe
for that afternoon she had had a frightfully painful scene with edward
as far as his letters went she claimed the right to open them when she chose
she arrogated to herself the right because edward's affairs were in such a frightful state and he lied so about them that she claimed the privilege of having his secrets at her disposal
there was not indeed any other way for the poor fool was too ashamed of his lapses ever to make a clean breast of anything
she had to drag these things out of him
it must have been a pretty elevating job for her
but that afternoon edward being on his bed for the hour and a half prescribed by the kur authorities she had opened a letter that she took to come from a colonel hervey
they were going to stay with him in linlithgowshire for the month of september and she did not know whether the date fixed would be the eleventh or the eighteenth
the address on this letter was in handwriting as like colonel hervey's as one blade of corn is like another
so she had at the moment no idea of spying on him
but she certainly was
for she discovered that edward ashburnham was paying a blackmailer of whom she had never heard something like three hundred pounds a year
it was a devil of a blow it was like death for she imagined that by that time she had really got to the bottom of her husband's liabilities
you see they were pretty heavy
what had really smashed them up had been a perfectly commonplace affair at monte carloan affair with a cosmopolitan harpy who passed for the mistress of a russian grand duke
she exacted a twenty thousand pound pearl tiara from him as the price of her favours for a week or so
it would have pipped him a good deal to have found so much and he was not in the ordinary way a gambler
he might indeed just have found the twenty thousand and the not slight charges of a week at an hotel with the fair creature
he must have been worth at that date five hundred thousand dollars and a little over
well he must needs go to the tables and lose forty thousand pounds forty thousand solid pounds borrowed from sharks
and even after that he mustit was an imperative passionenjoy the favours of the lady
he got them of course when it was a matter of solid bargaining for far less than twenty thousand as he might no doubt have done from the first
i daresay ten thousand dollars covered the bill
anyhow there was a pretty solid hole in a fortune of a hundred thousand pounds or so
and leonora had to fix things up he would have run from moneylender to moneylender
and that was quite in the early days of her discovery of his infidelitiesif you like to call them infidelities
and she discovered that one from public sources
god knows what would have happened if she had not discovered it from public sources
i suppose he would have concealed it from her until they were penniless
but she was able by the grace of god to get hold of the actual lenders of the money to learn the exact sums that were needed
and she went off to england
yes she went right off to england to her attorney and his while he was still in the arms of his circeat antibes to which place they had retired
he got sick of the lady quite quickly but not before leonora had had such lessons in the art of business from her attorney that she had her plan as clearly drawn up as was ever that of general trochu for keeping the prussians out of paris in 
it was about as effectual at first or it seemed so
that would have been you know in  about nine years before the date of which i am talkingthe date of florence's getting her hold over leonora for that was what it amounted to well mrs ashburnham had simply forced edward to settle all his property upon her
she could force him to do anything in his clumsy goodnatured inarticulate way he was as frightened of her as of the devil
and he admired her enormously and he was as fond of her as any man could be of any woman
she took advantage of it to treat him as if he had been a person whose estates are being managed by the court of bankruptcy
i suppose it was the best thing for him
anyhow she had no end of a job for the first three years or so
unexpected liabilities kept on cropping upand that afflicted fool did not make it any easier
you see along with the passion of the chase went a frame of mind that made him be extraordinarily ashamed of himself
you may not believe it but he really had such a sort of respect for the chastity of leonora's imagination that he hatedhe was positively revolted at the thought that she should know that the sort of thing that he did existed in the world
so he would stick out in an agitated way against the accusation of ever having done anything
he wanted to preserve the virginity of his wife's thoughts
he told me that himself during the long walks we had at the lastwhile the girl was on the way to brindisi
so of course for those three years or so leonora had many agitations
and it was then that they really quarrelled
yes they quarrelled bitterly
that seems rather extravagant
you might have thought that leonora would be just calmly loathing and he lachrymosely contrite
but that was not it a bit
along with edward's passions and his shame for them went the violent conviction of the duties of his stationa conviction that was quite unreasonably expensive
i trust i have not in talking of his liabilities given the impression that poor edward was a promiscuous libertine
he was not he was a sentimentalist
the servant girl in the kilsyte case had been pretty but mournful of appearance
i think that when he had kissed her he had desired rather to comfort her
and if she had succumbed to his blandishments i daresay he would have set her up in a little house in portsmouth or winchester and would have been faithful to her for four or five years
he was quite capable of that
no the only two of his affairs of the heart that cost him money were that of the grand duke's mistress and that which was the subject of the blackmailing letter that leonora opened
that had been a quite passionate affair with quite a nice woman
it had succeeded the one with the grand ducal lady
the lady was the wife of a brother officer and leonora had known all about the passion which had been quite a real passion and had lasted for several years
you see poor edward's passions were quite logical in their progression upwards
they began with a servant went on to a courtesan and then to a quite nice woman very unsuitably mated
for she had a quite nasty husband who by means of letters and things went on blackmailing poor edward to the tune of three or four hundred a yearwith threats of the divorce court
and after this lady came maisie maidan and after poor maisie only one more affair and thenthe real passion of his life
his marriage with leonora had been arranged by his parents and though he always admired her immensely he had hardly ever pretended to be much more than tender to her though he desperately needed her moral support too
but his really trying liabilities were mostly in the nature of generosities proper to his station
he was according to leonora always remitting his tenants' rents and giving the tenants to understand that the reduction would be permanent he was always redeeming drunkards who came before his magisterial bench he was always trying to put prostitutes into respectable placesand he was a perfect maniac about children
i don't know how many illused people he did not pick up and provide with careersleonora has told me but i daresay she exaggerated and the figure seems so preposterous that i will not put it down
all these things and the continuance of them seemed to him to be his dutyalong with impossible subscriptions to hospitals and boy scouts and to provide prizes at cattle shows and antivivisection societies  well leonora saw to it that most of these things were not continued
they could not possibly keep up branshaw manor at that rate after the money had gone to the grand duke's mistress
she put the rents back at their old figures discharged the drunkards from their homes and sent all the societies notice that they were to expect no more subscriptions
to the children she was more tender nearly all of them she supported till the age of apprenticeship or domestic service
you see she was childless herself
she was childless herself and she considered herself to be to blame
she had come of a penniless branch of the powys family and they had forced upon her poor dear edward without making the stipulation that the children should be brought up as catholics
and that of course was spiritual death to leonora
i have given you a wrong impression if i have not made you see that leonora was a woman of a strong cold conscience like all english catholics
i cannot myself help disliking this religion there is always at the bottom of my mind in spite of leonora the feeling of shuddering at the scarlet woman that filtered in upon me in the tranquility of the little old friends' meeting house in arch street philadelphia
so i do set down a good deal of leonora's mismanagement of poor dear edward's case to the peculiarly english form of her religion
because of course the only thing to have done for edward would have been to let him sink down until he became a tramp of gentlemanly address having maybe chance love affairs upon the highways
he would have done so much less harm he would have been much less agonized too
at any rate he would have had fewer chances of ruining and of remorse
for edward was great at remorse
but leonora's english catholic conscience her rigid principles her coldness even her very patience were i cannot help thinking all wrong in this special case
she quite seriously and navely imagined that the church of rome disapproves of divorce she quite seriously and navely believed that her church could be such a monstrous and imbecile institution as to expect her to take on the impossible job of making edward ashburnham a faithful husband
she had as the english would say the nonconformist temperament
in the united states of north america we call it the new england conscience
for of course that frame of mind has been driven in on the english catholics
the centuries that they have gone throughcenturies of blind and malignant oppression of ostracism from public employment of being as it were a small beleagured garrison in a hostile country and therefore having to act with great formalityall these things have combined to perform that conjuring trick
and i suppose that papists in england are even technically nonconformists
continental papists are a dirty jovial and unscrupulous crew
but that at least lets them be opportunists
they would have fixed poor dear edward up all right
forgive my writing of these monstrous things in this frivolous manner
if i did not i should break down and cry
in milan say or in paris leonora would have had her marriage dissolved in six months for two hundred dollars paid in the right quarter
and edward would have drifted about until he became a tramp of the kind i have suggested
or he would have married a barmaid who would have made him such frightful scenes in public places and would so have torn out his moustache and left visible signs upon his face that he would have been faithful to her for the rest of his days
that was what he wanted to redeem him  for along with his passions and his shames there went the dread of scenes in public places of outcry of excited physical violence of publicity in short
yes the barmaid would have cured him
and it would have been all the better if she drank he would have been kept busy looking after her
i know that i am right in this
i know it because of the kilsyte case
you see the servant girl that he then kissed was nurse in the family of the nonconformist head of the countywhatever that post may be called
and that gentleman was so determined to ruin edward who was the chairman of the tory caucus or whatever it isthat the poor dear sufferer had the very devil of a time
they asked questions about it in the house of commons they tried to get the hampshire magistrates degraded they suggested to the war ministry that edward was not the proper person to hold the king's commission
yes he got it hot and strong
the result you have heard
he was completely cured of philandering amongst the lower classes
and that seemed a real blessing to leonora
it did not revolt her so much to be connectedit is a sort of connectionwith people like mrs maidan instead of with a little kitchenmaid
in a dim sort of way leonora was almost contented when she arrived at nauheim that evening  she had got things nearly straight by the long years of scraping in little stations in chitral and burmastations where living is cheap in comparison with the life of a county magnate and where moreover liaisons of one sort or another are normal and inexpensive too
so that when mrs maidan came alongand the maidan affair might have caused trouble out there because of the youth of the husbandleonora had just resigned herself to coming home
with pushing and scraping and with letting branshaw teleragh and with selling a picture and a relic of charles i or so had gotand poor dear she had never had a really decent dress to her back in all those years and yearsshe had got as she imagined her poor dear husband back into much the same financial position as had been his before the mistress of the grand duke had happened along
and of course edward himself had helped her a little on the financial side
he was a fellow that many men liked
he was so presentable and quite ready to lend you his cigar puncherthat sort of thing
so every now and then some financier whom he met about would give him a good sound profitable tip
and leonora was never afraid of a bit of a gambleenglish papists seldom are i do not know why
so nearly all her investment turned up trumps and edward was really in fit case to reopen branshaw manor and once more to assume his position in the county
thus leonora had accepted maisie maidan almost with resignationalmost with a sigh of relief
she really liked the poor childshe had to like somebody
and at any rate she felt she could trust maisieshe could trust her not to rook edward for several thousands a week for maisie had refused to accept so much as a trinket ring from him
it is true that edward gurgled and raved about the girl in a way that she had never yet experienced
but that too was almost a relief
i think she would really have welcomed it if he could have come across the love of his life
it would have given her a rest
and there could not have been anyone better than poor little mrs maidan she was so ill she could not want to be taken on expensive jaunts
it was leonora herself who paid maisie's expenses to nauheim
she handed over the money to the boy husband for maisie would never have allowed it but the husband was in agonies of fear
poor devil
i fancy that on the voyage from india leonora was as happy as ever she had been in her life
edward was wrapped up completely in his girlhe was almost like a father with a child trotting about with rugs and physic and things from deck to deck
he behaved however with great circumspection so that nothing leaked through to the other passengers
and leonora had almost attained to the attitude of a mother towards mrs maidan
so it had looked very wellthe benevolent wealthy couple of good people acting as saviours to the poor darkeyed dying young thing
and that attitude of leonora's towards mrs maidan no doubt partly accounted for the smack in the face
she was hitting a naughty child who had been stealing chocolates at an inopportune moment
it was certainly an inopportune moment
for with the opening of that blackmailing letter from that injured brother officer all the old terrors had redescended upon leonora
her road had again seemed to stretch out endless she imagined that there might be hundreds and hundreds of such things that edward was concealing from herthat they might necessitate more mortgagings more pawnings of bracelets more and always more horrors
she had spent an excruciating afternoon
the matter was one of a divorce case of course and she wanted to avoid publicity as much as edward did so that she saw the necessity of continuing the payments
and she did not so much mind that
they could find three hundred a year
but it was the horror of there being more such obligations
she had had no conversation with edward for many yearsnone that went beyond the mere arrangements for taking trains or engaging servants
but that afternoon she had to let him have it
and he had been just the same as ever
it was like opening a book after a decade to find the words the same
he had the same motives
he had not wished to tell her about the case because he had not wished her to sully her mind with the idea that there was such a thing as a brother officer who could be a blackmailerand he had wanted to protect the credit of his old light of love
that lady was certainly not concerned with her husband
and he swore and swore and swore that there was nothing else in the world against him
she did not believe him
he had done it once too oftenand she was wrong for the first time so that he acted a rather creditable part in the matter
for he went right straight out to the postoffice and spent several hours in coding a telegram to his solicitor bidding that hardheaded man to threaten to take out at once a warrant against the fellow who was on his track
he said afterwards that it was a bit too thick on poor old leonora to be ballyragged any more
that was really the last of his outstanding accounts and he was ready to take his personal chance of the divorce court if the blackmailer turned nasty
he would face it outthe publicity the papers the whole bally show
those were his simple words
he had made however the mistake of not telling leonora where he was going so that having seen him go to his room to fetch the code for the telegram and seeing two hours later maisie maidan come out of his room leonora imagined that the two hours she had spent in silent agony edward had spent with maisie maidan in his arms
that seemed to her to be too much
as a matter of fact maisie's being in edward's room had been the result partly of poverty partly of pride partly of sheer innocence
she could not in the first place afford a maid she refrained as much as possible from sending the hotel servants on errands since every penny was of importance to her and she feared to have to pay high tips at the end of her stay
edward had lent her one of his fascinating cases containing fifteen different sizes of scissors and having seen from her window his departure for the postoffice she had taken the opportunity of returning the case
she could not see why she should not though she felt a certain remorse at the thought that she had kissed the pillows of his bed
that was the way it took her
but leonora could see that without the shadow of a doubt the incident gave florence a hold over her
it let florence into things and florence was the only created being who had any idea that the ashburnhams were not just good people with nothing to their tails
she determined at once not so much to give florence the privilege of her intimacywhich would have been the payment of a kind of blackmailas to keep florence under observation until she could have demonstrated to florence that she was not in the least jealous of poor maisie
so that was why she had entered the diningroom arm in arm with my wife and why she had so markedly planted herself at our table
she never left us indeed for a minute that night except just to run up to mrs maidan's room to beg her pardon and to beg her also to let edward take her very markedly out into the gardens that night
she said herself when mrs maidan came rather wistfully down into the lounge where we were all sitting now edward get up and take maisie to the casino
i want mrs dowell to tell me all about the families in connecticut who came from fordingbridge
for it had been discovered that florence came of a line that had actually owned branshaw teleragh for two centuries before the ashburnhams came there
and there she sat with me in that hall long after florence had gone to bed so that i might witness her gay reception of that pair
she could play up
and that enables me to fix exactly the day of our going to the town of m
for it was the very day poor mrs maidan died
we found her dead when we got backpretty awful that when you come to figure out what it all means  at any rate the measure of my relief when leonora said that she was an irish catholic gives you the measure of my affection for that couple
it was an affection so intense that even to this day i cannot think of edward without sighing
i do not believe that i could have gone on any more with them
i was getting too tired
and i verily believe too if my suspicion that leonora was jealous of florence had been the reason she gave for her outburst i should have turned upon florence with the maddest kind of rage
jealousy would have been incurable
but florence's mere silly jibes at the irish and at the catholics could be apologized out of existence
and that i appeared to fix up in two minutes or so
she looked at me for a long time rather fixedly and queerly while i was doing it
and at last i worked myself up to saying  do accept the situation
i confess that i do not like your religion
but i like you so intensely
i don't mind saying that i have never had anyone to be really fond of and i do not believe that anyone has ever been fond of me as i believe you really to be
oh i'm fond enough of you she said
fond enough to say that i wish every man was like you
but there are others to be considered
she was thinking as a matter of fact of poor maisie
she picked a little piece of pellitory out of the breasthigh wall in front of us
she chafed it for a long minute between her finger and thumb then she threw it over the coping
oh i accept the situation she said at last if you can
vi  i remember laughing at the phrase accept the situation which she seemed to repeat with a gravity too intense
i said to her something like  it's hardly as much as that
i mean that i must claim the liberty of a free american citizen to think what i please about your coreligionists
and i suppose that florence must have liberty to think what she pleases and to say what politeness allows her to say
she had better leonora answered not say one single word against my people or my faith
it struck me at the time that there was an unusual an almost threatening hardness in her voice
it was almost as if she were trying to convey to florence through me that she would seriously harm my wife if florence went to something that was an extreme
yes i remember thinking at the time that it was almost as if leonora were saying through me to florence  you may outrage me as you will you may take all that i personally possess but do not you care to say one single thing in view of the situation that that will set upagainst the faith that makes me become the doormat for your feet
but obviously as i saw it that could not be her meaning
good people be they ever so diverse in creed do not threaten each other
so that i read leonora's words to mean just no more than it would be better if florence said nothing at all against my coreligionists because it is a point that i am touchy about
that was the hint that accordingly i conveyed to florence when shortly afterwards she and edward came down from the tower
and i want you to understand that from that moment until after edward and the girl and florence were all dead together i had never the remotest glimpse not the shadow of a suspicion that there was anything wrong as the saying is
for five minutes then i entertained the possibility that leonora might be jealous but there was never another flicker in that flamelike personality
how in the world should i get it
for all that time i was just a male sick nurse
and what chance had i against those three hardened gamblers who were all in league to conceal their hands from me
what earthly chance
they were three to oneand they made me happy
oh god they made me so happy that i doubt if even paradise that shall smooth out all temporal wrongs shall ever give me the like
and what could they have done better or what could they have done that could have been worse
i don't know
i suppose that during all that time i was a deceived husband and that leonora was pimping for edward
that was the cross that she had to take up during her long calvary of a life  you ask how it feels to be a deceived husband
just heavens i do not know
it feels just nothing at all
it is not hell certainly it is not necessarily heaven
so i suppose it is the intermediate stage
what do they call it
limbo
no i feel nothing at all about that
they are dead they have gone before their judge who i hope will open to them the springs of his compassion
it is not my business to think about it
it is simply my business to say as leonora's people say requiem aeternam dona eis domine et lux perpetua luceat eis
in memoria aeterna erit but what were they
the just
the unjust
god knows
i think that the pair of them were only poor wretches creeping over this earth in the shadow of an eternal wrath
it is very terrible
it is almost too terrible the picture of that judgement as it appears to me sometimes at nights
it is probably the suggestion of some picture that i have seen somewhere
but upon an immense plain suspended in midair i seem to see three figures two of them clasped close in an intense embrace and one intolerably solitary
it is in black and white my picture of that judgement an etching perhaps only i cannot tell an etching from a photographic reproduction
and the immense plain is the hand of god stretching out for miles and miles with great spaces above it and below it
and they are in the sight of god and it is florence that is alone and do you know at the thought of that intense solitude i feel an overwhelming desire to rush forward and comfort her
you cannot you see have acted as nurse to a person for twelve years without wishing to go on nursing them even though you hate them with the hatred of the adder and even in the palm of god
but in the nights with that vision of judgement before me i know that i hold myself back
for i hate florence
i hate florence with such a hatred that i would not spare her an eternity of loneliness
she need not have done what she did
she was an american a new englander
she had not the hot passions of these europeans
she cut out that poor imbecile of an edwardand i pray god that he is really at peace clasped close in the arms of that poor poor girl
and no doubt maisie maidan will find her young husband again and leonora will burn clear and serene a northern light and one of the archangels of god
and me well perhaps they will find me an elevator to run
but florence   she should not have done it
she should not have done it
it was playing it too low down
she cut out poor dear edward from sheer vanity she meddled between him and leonora from a sheer imbecile spirit of district visiting
do you understand that whilst she was edward's mistress she was perpetually trying to reunite him to his wife
she would gabble on to leonora about forgivenesstreating the subject from the bright american point of view
and leonora would treat her like the whore she was
once she said to florence in the early morning  you come to me straight out of his bed to tell me that that is my proper place
i know it thank you
but even that could not stop florence
she went on saying that it was her ambition to leave this world a little brighter by the passage of her brief life and how thankfully she would leave edward whom she thought she had brought to a right frame of mind if leonora would only give him a chance
he needed she said tenderness beyond anything
and leonora would answerfor she put up with this outrage for yearsleonora as i understand would answer something like  yes you would give him up
and you would go on writing to each other in secret and committing adultery in hired rooms
i know the pair of you you know
no
i prefer the situation as it is
half the time florence would ignore leonora's remarks
she would think they were not quite ladylike
the other half of the time she would try to persuade leonora that her love for edward was quite spiritualon account of her heart
once she said  if you can believe that of maisie maidan as you say you do why cannot you believe it of me
leonora was i understand doing her hair at that time in front of the mirror in her bedroom
and she looked round at florence to whom she did not usually vouchsafe a glanceshe looked round coolly and calmly and said  never do you dare to mention mrs maidan's name again
you murdered her
you and i murdered her between us
i am as much a scoundrel as you
i don't like to be reminded of it
florence went off at once into a babble of how could she have hurt a person whom she hardly knew a person whom with the best intentions in pursuance of her efforts to leave the world a little brighter she had tried to save from edward
that was how she figured it out to herself
she really thought that
so leonora said patiently  very well just put it that i killed her and that it's a painful subject
one does not like to think that one had killed someone
naturally not
i ought never to have brought her from india
and that indeed is exactly how leonora looked at it
it is stated a little baldly but leonora was always a great one for bald statements
what had happened on the day of our jaunt to the ancient city of m had been this  leonora who had been even then filled with pity and contrition for the poor child on returning to our hotel had gone straight to mrs maidan's room
she had wanted just to pet her
and she had perceived at first only on the clear round table covered with red velvet a letter addressed to her
it ran something like  oh mrs ashburnham how could you have done it
i trusted you so
you never talked to me about me and edward but i trusted you
how could you buy me from my husband
i have just heard how you havein the hall they were talking about it edward and the american lady
you paid the money for me to come here
oh how could you
how could you
i am going straight back to bunny bunny was mrs maidan's husband
and leonora said that as she went on reading the letter she had without looking round her a sense that that hotel room was cleared that there were no papers on the table that there were no clothes on the hooks and that there was a strained silencea silence she said as if there were something in the room that drank up such sounds as there were
she had to fight against that feeling whilst she read the postscript of the letter
i did not know you wanted me for an adulteress the postscript began
the poor child was hardly literate
it was surely not right of you and i never wanted to be one
and i heard edward call me a poor little rat to the american lady
he always called me a little rat in private and i did not mind
but if he called me it to her i think he does not love me any more
oh mrs ashburnham you knew the world and i knew nothing
i thought it would be all right if you thought it could and i thought you would not have brought me if you did not too
you should not have done it and we out of the same convent  leonora said that she screamed when she read that
and then she saw that maisie's boxes were all packed and she began a search for mrs maidan herselfall over the hotel
the manager said that mrs maidan had paid her bill and had gone up to the station to ask the reiseverkehrsbureau to make her out a plan for her immediate return to chitral
he imagined that he had seen her come back but he was not quite certain
no one in the large hotel had bothered his head about the child
and she wandering solitarily in the hall had no doubt sat down beside a screen that had edward and florence on the other side
i never heard then or after what had passed between that precious couple
i fancy florence was just about beginning her cutting out of poor dear edward by addressing to him some words of friendly warning as to the ravages he might be making in the girl's heart
that would be the sort of way she would begin
and edward would have sentimentally assured her that there was nothing in it that maisie was just a poor little rat whose passage to nauheim his wife had paid out of her own pocket
that would have been enough to do the trick
for the trick was pretty efficiently done
leonora with panic growing and with contrition very large in her heart visited every one of the public rooms of the hotelthe diningroom the lounge the schreibzimmer the winter garden
god knows what they wanted with a winter garden in an hotel that is only open from may till october
but there it was
and then leonora ranyes she ran up the stairsto see if maisie had not returned to her rooms
she had determined to take that child right away from that hideous place
it seemed to her to be all unspeakable
i do not mean to say that she was not quite cool about it
leonora was always leonora
but the cold justice of the thing demanded that she should play the part of mother to this child who had come from the same convent
she figured it out to amount to that
she would leave edward to florence and to meand she would devote all her time to providing that child with an atmosphere of love until she could be returned to her poor young husband
it was naturally too late
she had not cared to look round maisie's rooms at first
now as soon as she came in she perceived sticking out beyond the bed a small pair of feet in highheeled shoes
maisie had died in the effort to strap up a great portmanteau
she had died so grotesquely that her little body had fallen forward into the trunk and it had closed upon her like the jaws of a gigantic alligator
the key was in her hand
her dark hair like the hair of a japanese had come down and covered her body and her face
leonora lifted her upshe was the merest featherweightand laid her on the bed with her hair about her
she was smiling as if she had just scored a goal in a hockey match
you understand she had not committed suicide
her heart had just stopped
i saw her with the long lashes on the cheeks with the smile about the lips with the flowers all about her
the stem of a white lily rested in her hand so that the spike of flowers was upon her shoulder
she looked like a bride in the sunlight of the mortuary candles that were all about her and the white coifs of the two nuns that knelt at her feet with their faces hidden might have been two swans that were to bear her away to kissingkindness land or wherever it is
leonora showed her to me
she would not let either of the others see her
she wanted you know to spare poor dear edward's feelings
he never could bear the sight of a corpse
and since she never gave him an idea that maisie had written to her he imagined that the death had been the most natural thing in the world
he soon got over it
indeed it was the one affair of his about which he never felt much remorse
part ii  i  the death of mrs maidan occurred on the th of august 
and then nothing happened until the th of august 
there is the curious coincidence of dates but i do not know whether that is one of those sinister as if half jocular and altogether merciless proceedings on the part of a cruel providence that we call a coincidence
because it may just as well have been the superstitious mind of florence that forced her to certain acts as if she had been hypnotized
it is however certain that the th of august always proved a significant date for her
to begin with she was born on the th of august
then on that date in the year  she set out with her uncle for the tour round the world in company with a young man called jimmy
but that was not merely a coincidence
her kindly old uncle with the supposedly damaged heart was in his delicate way offering her in this trip a birthday present to celebrate her coming of age
then on the th of august  she yielded to an action that certainly coloured her whole lifeas well as mine
she had no luck
she was probably offering herself a birthday present that morning on the th of august  she married me and set sail for europe in a great gale of windthe gale that affected her heart
and no doubt there again she was offering herself a birthday giftthe birthday gift of my miserable life
it occurs to me that i have never told you anything about my marriage
that was like this i have told you as i think that i first met florence at the stuyvesants' in fourteenth street
and from that moment i determined with all the obstinacy of a possibly weak nature if not to make her mine at least to marry her
i had no occupationi had no business affairs
i simply camped down there in stamford in a vile hotel and just passed my days in the house or on the verandah of the misses hurlbird
the misses hurlbird in an odd obstinate way did not like my presence
but they were hampered by the national manners of these occasions
florence had her own sittingroom
she could ask to it whom she liked and i simply walked into that apartment
i was as timid as you will but in that matter i was like a chicken that is determined to get across the road in front of an automobile
i would walk into florence's pretty little oldfashioned room take off my hat and sit down
florence had of course several other fellows toostrapping young new englanders who worked during the day in new york and spent only the evenings in the village of their birth
and in the evenings they would march in on florence with almost as much determination as i myself showed
and i am bound to say that they were received with as much disfavour as was my portionfrom the misses hurlbird
they were curious old creatures those two
it was almost as if they were members of an ancient family under some cursethey were so gentlewomanly so proper and they sighed so
sometimes i would see tears in their eyes
i do not know that my courtship of florence made much progress at first
perhaps that was because it took place almost entirely during the daytime on hot afternoons when the clouds of dust hung like fog right up as high as the tops of the thinleaved elms
the night i believe is the proper season for the gentle feats of love not a connecticut july afternoon when any sort of proximity is an almost appalling thought
but if i never so much as kissed florence she let me discover very easily in the course of a fortnight her simple wants
and i could supply those wants  she wanted to marry a gentleman of leisure she wanted a european establishment
she wanted her husband to have an english accent an income of fifty thousand dollars a year from real estate and no ambitions to increase that income
andshe faintly hintedshe did not want much physical passion in the affair
americans you know can envisage such unions without blinking
she gave out this information in floods of bright talkshe would pop a little bit of it into comments over a view of the rialto venice and whilst she was brightly describing balmoral castle she would say that her ideal husband would he one who could get her received at the british court
she had spent it seemed two months in great britainseven weeks in touring from stratford to strathpeffer and one as paying guest in an old english family near ledbury an impoverished but still stately family called bagshawe
they were to have spent two months more in that tranquil bosom but inopportune events apparently in her uncle's business had caused their rather hurried return to stamford
the young man called jimmy had remained in europe to perfect his knowledge of that continent
he certainly did he was most useful to us afterwards
but the point that came outthat there was no mistakingwas that florence was coldly and calmly determined to take no look at any man who could not give her a european settlement
her glimpse of english home life had effected this
she meant on her marriage to have a year in paris and then to have her husband buy some real estate in the neighbourhood of fordingbridge from which place the hurlbirds had come in the year 
on the strength of that she was going to take her place in the ranks of english county society
that was fixed
i used to feel mightily elevated when i considered these details for i could not figure out that amongst her acquaintances in stamford there was any fellow that would fill the bill
the most of them were not as wealthy as i and those that were were not the type to give up the fascinations of wall street even for the protracted companionship of florence
but nothing really happened during the month of july
on the st of august florence apparently told her aunts that she intended to marry me
she had not told me so but there was no doubt about the aunts for on that afternoon miss florence hurlbird senior stopped me on my way to florence's sittingroom and took me agitatedly into the parlour
it was a singular interview in that oldfashioned colonial room with the spindlelegged furniture the silhouettes the miniatures the portrait of general braddock and the smell of lavender
you see the two poor maiden ladies were in agoniesand they could not say one single thing direct
they would almost wring their hands and ask if i had considered such a thing as different temperaments
i assure you they were almost affectionate concerned for me even as if florence were too bright for my solid and serious virtues
for they had discovered in me solid and serious virtues
that might have been because i had once dropped the remark that i preferred general braddock to general washington
for the hurlbirds had backed the losing side in the war of independence and had been seriously impoverished and quite efficiently oppressed for that reason
the misses hurlbird could never forget it
nevertheless they shuddered at the thought of a european career for myself and florence
each of them really wailed when they heard that that was what i hoped to give their niece
that may have been partly because they regarded europe as a sink of iniquity where strange laxities prevailed
they thought the mother country as erastian as any other
and they carried their protests to extraordinary lengths for them
they even almost said that marriage was a sacrament but neither miss florence nor miss emily could quite bring herself to utter the word
and they almost brought themselves to say that florence's early life had been characterized by flirtationssomething of that sort
i know i ended the interview by saying  i don't care
if florence has robbed a bank i am going to marry her and take her to europe
and at that miss emily wailed and fainted
but miss florence in spite of the state of her sister threw herself on my neck and cried out don't do it john
don't do it
you're a good young man and she added whilst i was getting out of the room to send florence to her aunt's rescue  we ought to tell you more
but she's our dear sister's child
florence i remember received me with a chalkpale face and the exclamation  have those old cats been saying anything against me
but i assured her that they had not and hurried her into the room of her strangely afflicted relatives
i had really forgotten all about that exclamation of florence's until this moment
she treated me so very wellwith such tactthat if i ever thought of it afterwards i put it down to her deep affection for me
and that evening when i went to fetch her for a buggyride she had disappeared
i did not lose any time
i went into new york and engaged berths on the pocahontas that was to sail on the evening of the fourth of the month and then returning to stamford i tracked out in the course of the day that florence had been driven to rye station
and there i found that she had taken the cars to waterbury
she had of course gone to her uncle's
the old man received me with a stony husky face
i was not to see florence she was ill she was keeping her room
and from something that he let dropan odd biblical phrase that i have forgotteni gathered that all that family simply did not intend her to marry ever in her life
i procured at once the name of the nearest minister and a rope ladderyou have no idea how primitively these matters were arranged in those days in the united states
i daresay that may be so still
and at one o'clock in the morning of the th of august i was standing in florence's bedroom
i was so oneminded in my purpose that it never struck me there was anything improper in being at one o'clock in the morning in florence's bedroom
i just wanted to wake her up
she was not however asleep
she expected me and her relatives had only just left her
she received me with an embrace of a warmth well it was the first time i had ever been embraced by a womanand it was the last when a woman's embrace has had in it any warmth for me
i suppose it was my own fault what followed
at any rate i was in such a hurry to get the wedding over and was so afraid of her relatives finding me there that i must have received her advances with a certain amount of absence of mind
i was out of that room and down the ladder in under half a minute
she kept me waiting at the foot an unconscionable timeit was certainly three in the morning before we knocked up that minister
and i think that that wait was the only sign florence ever showed of having a conscience as far as i was concerned unless her lying for some moments in my arms was also a sign of conscience
i fancy that if i had shown warmth then she would have acted the proper wife to me or would have put me back again
but because i acted like a philadelphia gentleman she made me i suppose go through with the part of a male nurse
perhaps she thought that i should not mind
after that as i gather she had not any more remorse
she was only anxious to carry out her plans
for just before she came down the ladder she called me to the top of that grotesque implement that i went up and down like a tranquil jumpingjack
i was perfectly collected
she said to me with a certain fierceness  it is determined that we sail at four this afternoon
you are not lying about having taken berths
i understood that she would naturally be anxious to get away from the neighbourhood of her apparently insane relatives so that i readily excused her for thinking that i should be capable of lying about such a thing
i made it therefore plain to her that it was my fixed determination to sail by the pocahontas
she said thenit was a moonlit morning and she was whispering in my ear whilst i stood on the ladder
the hills that surround waterbury showed extraordinarily tranquil around the villa
she said almost coldly  i wanted to know so as to pack my trunks
and she added i may be ill you know
i guess my heart is a little like uncle hurlbird's
it runs in families
i whispered that the pocahontas was an extraordinarily steady boat  now i wonder what had passed through florence's mind during the two hours that she had kept me waiting at the foot of the ladder
i would give not a little to know
till then i fancy she had had no settled plan in her mind
she certainly never mentioned her heart till that time
perhaps the renewed sight of her uncle hurlbird had given her the idea
certainly her aunt emily who had come over with her to waterbury would have rubbed into her for hours and hours the idea that any accentuated discussions would kill the old gentleman
that would recall to her mind all the safeguards against excitement with which the poor silly old gentleman had been hedged in during their trip round the world
that perhaps put it into her head
still i believe there was some remorse on my account too
leonora told me that florence said there wasfor leonora knew all about it and once went so far as to ask her how she could do a thing so infamous
she excused herself on the score of an overmastering passion
well i always say that an overmastering passion is a good excuse for feelings
you cannot help them
and it is a good excuse for straight actionsshe might have bolted with the fellow before or after she married me
and if they had not enough money to get along with they might have cut their throats or sponged on her family though of course florence wanted such a lot that it would have suited her very badly to have for a husband a clerk in a drygoods store which was what old hurlbird would have made of that fellow
he hated him
no i do not think that there is much excuse for florence
god knows
she was a frightened fool and she was fantastic and i suppose that at that time she really cared for that imbecile
he certainly didn't care for her
poor thing at any rate after i had assured her that the pocahontas was a steady ship she just said you'll have to look after me in certain wayslike uncle hurlbird is looked after
i will tell you how to do it
and then she stepped over the sill as if she were stepping on board a boat
i suppose she had burnt hers
i had no doubt eyeopeners enough
when we reentered the hurlbird mansion at eight o'clock the hurlbirds were just exhausted
florence had a hard triumphant air
we had got married about four in the morning and had sat about in the woods above the town till then listening to a mockingbird imitate an old tomcat
so i guess florence had not found getting married to me a very stimulating process
i had not found anything much more inspiring to say than how glad i was with variations
i think i was too dazed
well the hurlbirds were too dazed to say much
we had breakfast together and then florence went to pack her grips and things
old hurlbird took the opportunity to read me a fullblooded lecture in the style of an american oration as to the perils for young american girlhood lurking in the european jungle
he said that paris was full of snakes in the grass of which he had had bitter experience
he concluded as they always do poor dear old things with the aspiration that all american women should one day be sexlessthough that is not the way they put it   well we made the ship all right by onethirtyan there was a tempest blowing
that helped florence a good deal
for we were not ten minutes out from sandy hook before florence went down into her cabin and her heart took her
an agitated stewardess came running up to me and i went running down
i got my directions how to behave to my wife
most of them came from her though it was the ship doctor who discreetly suggested to me that i had better refrain from manifestations of affection
i was ready enough
i was of course full of remorse
it occurred to me that her heart was the reason for the hurlbirds' mysterious desire to keep their youngest and dearest unmarried
of course they would be too refined to put the motive into words
they were old stock new englanders
they would not want to have to suggest that a husband must not kiss the back of his wife's neck
they would not like to suggest that he might for the matter of that
i wonder though how florence got the doctor to enter the conspiracythe several doctors
of course her heart squeaked a bitshe had the same configuration of the lungs as her uncle hurlbird
and in his company she must have heard a great deal of heart talk from specialists
anyhow she and they tied me pretty well downand jimmy of course that dreary boywhat in the world did she see in him
he was lugubrious silent morose
he had no talent as a painter
he was very sallow and dark and he never shaved sufficiently
he met us at havre and he proceeded to make himself useful for the next two years during which he lived in our flat in paris whether we were there or not
he studied painting at julien's or some such place  that fellow had his hands always in the pockets of his odious squareshouldered broadhipped american coats and his dark eyes were always full of ominous appearances
he was besides too fat
why i was much the better man  and i daresay florence would have given me the better
she showed signs of it
i think perhaps the enigmatic smile with which she used to look back at me over her shoulder when she went into the bathing place was a sort of invitation
i have mentioned that
it was as if she were saying i am going in here
i am going to stand so stripped and white and straightand you are a man perhaps it was that  no she cannot have liked that fellow long
he looked like sallow putty
i understand that he had been slim and dark and very graceful at the time of her first disgrace
but loafing about in paris on her pocketmoney and on the allowance that old hurlbird made him to keep out of the united states had given him a stomach like a man of forty and dyspeptic irritation on top of it
god how they worked me
it was those two between them who really elaborated the rules
i have told you something about themhow i had to head conversations for all those eleven years off such topics as love poverty crime and so on
but looking over what i have written i see that i have unintentionally misled you when i said that florence was never out of my sight
yet that was the impression that i really had until just now
when i come to think of it she was out of my sight most of the time
you see that fellow impressed upon me that what florence needed most of all were sleep and privacy
i must never enter her room without knocking or her poor little heart might flutter away to its doom
he said these things with his lugubrious croak and his black eyes like a crow's so that i seemed to see poor florence die ten times a daya little pale frail corpse
why i would as soon have thought of entering her room without her permission as of burgling a church
i would sooner have committed that crime
i would certainly have done it if i had thought the state of her heart demanded the sacrilege
so at ten o'clock at night the door closed upon florence who had gently and as if reluctantly backed up that fellow's recommendations and she would wish me good night as if she were a cinquecento italian lady saying goodbye to her lover
and at ten o'clock of the next morning there she would come out the door of her room as fresh as venus rising from any of the couches that are mentioned in greek legends
her room door was locked because she was nervous about thieves but an electric contrivance on a cord was understood to be attached to her little wrist
she had only to press a bulb to raise the house
and i was provided with an axean axegreat gods with which to break down her door in case she ever failed to answer my knock after i knocked really loud several times
it was pretty well thought out you see
what wasn't so well thought out were the ultimate consequencesour being tied to europe
for that young man rubbed it so well into me that florence would die if she crossed the channelhe impressed it so fully on my mind that when later florence wanted to go to fordingbridge i cut the proposal shortabsolutely short with a curt no
it fixed her and it frightened her
i was even backed up by all the doctors
i seemed to have had endless interviews with doctor after doctor cool quiet men who would ask in reasonable tones whether there was any reason for our going to englandany special reason
and since i could not see any special reason they would give the verdict better not then
i daresay they were honest enough as things go
they probably imagined that the mere associations of the steamer might have effects on florence's nerves
that would be enough that and a conscientious desire to keep our money on the continent
it must have rattled poor florence pretty considerably for you see the main ideathe only main idea of her heart that was otherwise coldwas to get to fordingbridge and be a county lady in the home of her ancestors
but jimmy got her there he shut on her the door of the channel even on the fairest day of blue sky with the cliffs of england shining like mother of pearl in full view of calais i would not have let her cross the steamer gangway to save her life
i tell you it fixed her
it fixed her beautifully because she could not announce herself as cured since that would have put an end to the locked bedroom arrangements
and by the time she was sick of jimmywhich happened in the year she had taken on edward ashburnham
yes it was a bad fix for her because edward could have taken her to fordingbridge and though he could not give her branshaw manor that home of her ancestors being settled on his wife she could at least have pretty considerably queened it there or thereabouts what with our money and the support of the ashburnhams
her uncle as soon as he considered that she had really settled down with meand i sent him only the most glowing accounts of her virtue and constancymade over to her a very considerable part of his fortune for which he had no use
i suppose that we had between us fifteen thousand a year in english money though i never quite knew how much of hers went to jimmy
at any rate we could have shone in fordingbridge
i never quite knew either how she and edward got rid of jimmy
i fancy that fat and disreputable raven must have had his six golden front teeth knocked down his throat by edward one morning whilst i had gone out to buy some flowers in the rue de la paix leaving florence and the flat in charge of those two
and serve him very right is all that i can say
he was a bad sort of blackmailer i hope florence does not have his company in the next world
as god is my judge i do not believe that i would have separated those two if i had known that they really and passionately loved each other
i do not know where the public morality of the case comes in and of course no man really knows what he would have done in any given case
but i truly believe that i would have united them observing ways and means as decent as i could
i believe that i should have given them money to live upon and that i should have consoled myself somehow
at that date i might have found some young thing like maisie maidan or the poor girl and i might have had some peace
for peace i never had with florence and hardly believe that i cared for her in the way of love after a year or two of it
she became for me a rare and fragile object something burdensome but very frail
why it was as if i had been given a thinshelled pullet's egg to carry on my palm from equatorial africa to hoboken
yes she became for me as it were the subject of a betthe trophy of an athlete's achievement a parsley crown that is the symbol of his chastity his soberness his abstentions and of his inflexible will
of intrinsic value as a wife i think she had none at all for me
i fancy i was not even proud of the way she dressed
but her passion for jimmy was not even a passion and mad as the suggestion may appear she was frightened for her life
yes she was afraid of me
i will tell you how that happened
i had in the old days a darky servant called julius who valeted me and waited on me and loved me like the crown of his head
now when we left waterbury to go to the pocahontas florence entrusted to me one very special and very precious leather grip
she told me that her life might depend on that grip which contained her drugs against heart attacks
and since i was never much of a hand at carrying things i entrusted this in turn to julius who was a greyhaired chap of sixty or so and very picturesque at that
he made so much impression on florence that she regarded him as a sort of father and absolutely refused to let me take him to paris
he would have inconvenienced her
well julius was so overcome with grief at being left behind that he must needs go and drop the precious grip
i saw red i saw purple
i flew at julius
on the ferry it was i filled up one of his eyes i threatened to strangle him
and since an unresisting negro can make a deplorable noise and a deplorable spectacle and since that was florence's first adventure in the married state she got a pretty idea of my character
it affirmed in her the desperate resolve to conceal from me the fact that she was not what she would have called a pure woman
for that was really the mainspring of her fantastic actions
she was afraid that i should murder her
so she got up the heart attack at the earliest possible opportunity on board the liner
perhaps she was not so very much to be blamed
you must remember that she was a new englander and that new england had not yet come to loathe darkies as it does now
whereas if she had come from even so little south as philadelphia and had been an oldish family she would have seen that for me to kick julius was not so outrageous an act as for her cousin reggie hurlbird to sayas i have heard him say to his english butlerthat for two cents he would bat him on the pants
besides the medicinegrip did not bulk as largely in her eyes as it did in mine where it was the symbol of the existence of an adored wife of a day
to her it was just a useful lie  well there you have the position as clear as i can make itthe husband an ignorant fool the wife a cold sensualist with imbecile fearsfor i was such a fool that i should never have known what she was or was notand the blackmailing lover
and then the other lover came along  well edward ashburnham was worth having
have i conveyed to you the splendid fellow that he wasthe fine soldier the excellent landlord the extraordinarily kind careful and industrious magistrate the upright honest fairdealing fairthinking public character
i suppose i have not conveyed it to you
the truth is that i never knew it until the poor girl came alongthe poor girl who was just as straight as splendid and as upright as he
i swear she was
i suppose i ought to have known
i suppose that was really why i liked him so muchso infinitely much
come to think of it i can remember a thousand little acts of kindliness of thoughtfulness for his inferiors even on the continent
look here i know of two families of dirty unpicturesque hessian paupers that that fellow with an infinite patience rooted up got their police reports set on their feet or exported to my patient land
and he would do it quite inarticulately set in motion by seeing a child crying in the street
he would wrestle with dictionaries in that unfamiliar tongue well he could not bear to see a child cry
perhaps he could not bear to see a woman and not give her the comfort of his physical attractions
but although i liked him so intensely i was rather apt to take these things for granted
they made me feel comfortable with him good towards him they made me trust him
but i guess i thought it was part of the character of any english gentleman
why one day he got it into his head that the head waiter at the excelsior had been cryingthe fellow with the grey face and grey whiskers
and then he spent the best part of a week in correspondence and up at the british consul's in getting the fellow's wife to come back from london and bring back his girl baby
she had bolted with a swiss scullion
if she had not come inside the week he would have gone to london himself to fetch her
he was like that
edward ashburnham was like that and i thought it was only the duty of his rank and station
perhaps that was all that it wasbut i pray god to make me discharge mine as well
and but for the poor girl i daresay that i should never have seen it however much the feeling might have been over me
she had for him such enthusiasm that although even now i do not understand the technicalities of english life i can gather enough
she was with them during the whole of our last stay at nauheim
nancy rufford was her name she was leonora's only friend's only child and leonora was her guardian if that is the correct term
she had lived with the ashburnhams ever since she had been of the age of thirteen when her mother was said to have committed suicide owing to the brutalities of her father
yes it is a cheerful story edward always called her the girl and it was very pretty the evident affection he had for her and she for him
and leonora's feet she would have kissedthose two were for her the best man and the best woman on earthand in heaven
i think that she had not a thought of evil in her headthe poor girl  well anyhow she chanted edward's praises to me for the hour together but as i have said i could not make much of it
it appeared that he had the dso and that his troop loved him beyond the love of men
you never saw such a troop as his
and he had the royal humane society's medal with a clasp
that meant apparently that he had twice jumped off the deck of a troopship to rescue what the girl called tommies who had fallen overboard in the red sea and such places
he had been twice recommended for the vc whatever that might mean and although owing to some technicalities he had never received that apparently coveted order he had some special place about his sovereign at the coronation
or perhaps it was some post in the beefeaters'
she made him out like a cross between lohengrin and the chevalier bayard
perhaps he was
but he was too silent a fellow to make that side of him really decorative
i remember going to him at about that time and asking him what the dso
was and he grunted out  it's a sort of a thing they give grocers who've honourably supplied the troops with adulterated coffee in wartimesomething of that sort
he did not quite carry conviction to me so in the end i put it directly to leonora
i asked her fully and squarelyprefacing the question with some remarks such as those that i have already given you as to the difficulty one has in really getting to know people when one's intimacy is conducted as an english acquaintanceshipi asked her whether her husband was not really a splendid fellowalong at least the lines of his public functions
she looked at me with a slightly awakened airwith an air that would have been almost startled if leonora could ever have been startled
didn't you know
she asked
if i come to think of it there is not a more splendid fellow in any three counties pick them where you willalong those lines
and she added after she had looked at me reflectively for what seemed a long time  to do my husband justice there could not be a better man on the earth
there would not be room for italong those lines
well i said then he must really be lohengrin and the cid in one body
for there are not any other lines that count
again she looked at me for a long time
it's your opinion that there are no other lines that count
she asked slowly
well i answered gaily you're not going to accuse him of not being a good husband or of not being a good guardian to your ward
she spoke then slowly like a person who is listening to the sounds in a seashell held to her earand would you believe itshe told me afterwards that at that speech of mine for the first time she had a vague inkling of the tragedy that was to follow so soonalthough the girl had lived with them for eight years or so  oh i'm not thinking of saying that he is not the best of husbands or that he is not very fond of the girl
and then i said something like  well leonora a man sees more of these things than even a wife
and let me tell you that in all the years i've known edward he has never in your absence paid a moment's attention to any other womannot by the quivering of an eyelash
i should have noticed
and he talks of you as if you were one of the angels of god
oh she came up to the scratch as you could be sure leonora would always come up to the scratch i am perfectly sure that he always speaks nicely of me
i daresay she had practice in that sort of scenepeople must have been always complimenting her on her husband's fidelity and adoration
for half the worldthe whole of the world that knew edward and leonora believed that his conviction in the kilsyte affair had been a miscarriage of justicea conspiracy of false evidence got together by nonconformist adversaries
but think of the fool that i was  ii  let me think where we were
oh yes that conversation took place on the th of august 
i remember saying to her that on that day exactly nine years before i had made their acquaintance so that it had seemed quite appropriate and like a birthday speech to utter my little testimonial to my friend edward
i could quite confidently say that though we four had been about together in all sorts of places for all that length of time i had not for my part one single complaint to make of either of them
and i added that that was an unusual record for people who had been so much together
you are not to imagine that it was only at nauheim that we met
that would not have suited florence
i find on looking at my diaries that on the th of september  edward accompanied florence and myself to paris where we put him up till the twentyfirst of that month
he made another short visit to us in december of that yearthe first year of our acquaintance
it must have been during this visit that he knocked mr jimmy's teeth down his throat
i daresay florence had asked him to come over for that purpose
in  he was in paris three timesonce with leonora who wanted some frocks
in  we spent the best part of six weeks together at mentone and edward stayed with us in paris on his way back to london
that was how it went
the fact was that in florence the poor wretch had got hold of a tartar compared with whom leonora was a sucking kid
he must have had a hell of a time
leonora wanted to keep him forwhat shall i sayfor the good of her church as it were to show that catholic women do not lose their men
let it go at that for the moment
i will write more about her motives later perhaps
but florence was sticking on to the proprietor of the home of her ancestors
no doubt he was also a very passionate lover
but i am convinced that he was sick of florence within three years of even interrupted companionship and the life that she led him
if ever leonora so much as mentioned in a letter that they had had a woman staying with themor if she so much as mentioned a woman's name in a letter to meoff would go a desperate cable in cipher to that poor wretch at branshaw commanding him on pain of an instant and horrible disclosure to come over and assure her of his fidelity
i daresay he would have faced it out i daresay he would have thrown over florence and taken the risk of exposure
but there he had leonora to deal with
and leonora assured him that if the minutest fragment of the real situation ever got through to my senses she would wreak upon him the most terrible vengeance that she could think of
and he did not have a very easy job
florence called for more and more attentions from him as the time went on
she would make him kiss her at any moment of the day and it was only by his making it plain that a divorced lady could never assume a position in the county of hampshire that he could prevent her from making a bolt of it with him in her train
oh yes it was a difficult job for him
for florence if you please gaining in time a more composed view of nature and overcome by her habits of garrulity arrived at a frame of mind in which she found it almost necessary to tell me all about itnothing less than that
she said that her situation was too unbearable with regard to me
she proposed to tell me all secure a divorce from me and go with edward and settle in california
i do not suppose that she was really serious in this
it would have meant the extinction of all hopes of branshaw manor for her
besides she had got it into her head that leonora who was as sound as a roach was consumptive
she was always begging leonora before me to go and see a doctor
but none the less poor edward seems to have believed in her determination to carry him off
he would not have gone he cared for his wife too much
but if florence had put him at it that would have meant my getting to know of it and his incurring leonora's vengeance
and she could have made it pretty hot for him in ten or a dozen different ways
and she assured me that she would have used every one of them
she was determined to spare my feelings
and she was quite aware that at that date the hottest she could have made it for him would have been to refuse herself ever to see him again  well i think i have made it pretty clear
let me come to the th of august  the last day of my absolute ignoranceand i assure you of my perfect happiness
for the coming of that dear girl only added to it all
on that th of august i was sitting in the lounge with a rather odious englishman called bagshawe who had arrived that night too late for dinner
leonora had just gone to bed and i was waiting for florence and edward and the girl to come back from a concert at the casino
they had not gone there all together
florence i remember had said at first that she would remain with leonora and me and edward and the girl had gone off alone
and then leonora had said to florence with perfect calmness  i wish you would go with those two
i think the girl ought to have the appearance of being chaperoned with edward in these places
i think the time has come
so florence with her light step had slipped out after them
she was all in black for some cousin or other
americans are particular in those matters
we had gone on sitting in the lounge till towards ten when leonora had gone up to bed
it had been a very hot day but there it was cool
the man called bagshawe had been reading the times on the other side of the room but then he moved over to me with some trifling question as a prelude to suggesting an acquaintance
i fancy he asked me something about the polltax on kurguests and whether it could not be sneaked out of
he was that sort of person
well he was an unmistakable man with a military figure rather exaggerated with bulbous eyes that avoided your own and a pallid complexion that suggested vices practised in secret along with an uneasy desire for making acquaintance at whatever cost
the filthy toad 
he began by telling me that he came from ludlow manor near ledbury
the name had a slightly familiar sound though i could not fix it in my mind
then he began to talk about a duty on hops about californian hops about los angeles where he had been
he fencing for a topic with which he might gain my affection
and then quite suddenly in the bright light of the street i saw florence running
it was like thati saw florence running with a face whiter than paper and her hand on the black stuff over her heart
i tell you my own heart stood still i tell you i could not move
she rushed in at the swing doors
she looked round that place of rush chairs cane tables and newspapers
she saw me and opened her lips
she saw the man who was talking to me
she stuck her hands over her face as if she wished to push her eyes out
and she was not there any more
i could not move i could not stir a finger
and then that man said  by jove florry hurlbird
he turned upon me with an oily and uneasy sound meant for a laugh
he was really going to ingratiate himself with me
do you know who that is
he asked
the last time i saw that girl she was coming out of the bedroom of a young man called jimmy at five o'clock in the morning
in my house at ledbury
you saw her recognize me
he was standing on his feet looking down at me
i don't know what i looked like
at any rate he gave a sort of gurgle and then stuttered  oh i say those were the last words i ever heard of mr bagshawe's
a long time afterwards i pulled myself out of the lounge and went up to florence's room
she had not locked the doorfor the first time of our married life
she was lying quite respectably arranged unlike mrs maidan on her bed
she had a little phial that rightly should have contained nitrate of amyl in her right hand
that was on the th of august 
part iii  i  the odd thing is that what sticks out in my recollection of the rest of that evening was leonora's saying  of course you might marry her and when i asked whom she answered  the girl
now that is to me a very amazing thingamazing for the light of possibilities that it casts into the human heart
for i had never had the slightest conscious idea of marrying the girl i never had the slightest idea even of caring for her
i must have talked in an odd way as people do who are recovering from an anaesthetic
it is as if one had a dual personality the one i being entirely unconscious of the other
i had thought nothing i had said such an extraordinary thing
i don't know that analysis of my own psychology matters at all to this story
i should say that it didn't or at any rate that i had given enough of it
but that odd remark of mine had a strong influence upon what came after
i mean that leonora would probably never have spoken to me at all about florence's relations with edward if i hadn't said two hours after my wife's death  now i can marry the girl
she had then taken it for granted that i had been suffering all that she had been suffering or at least that i had permitted all that she had permitted
so that a month ago about a week after the funeral of poor edward she could say to me in the most natural way in the worldi had been talking about the duration of my stay at branshawshe said with her clear reflective intonation  oh stop here for ever and ever if you can
and then she added you couldn't be more of a brother to me or more of a counsellor or more of a support
you are all the consolation i have in the world
and isn't it odd to think that if your wife hadn't been my husband's mistress you would probably never have been here at all
that was how i got the newsfull in the face like that
i didn't say anything and i don't suppose i felt anything unless maybe it was with that mysterious and unconscious self that underlies most people
perhaps one day when i am unconscious or walking in my sleep i may go and spit upon poor edward's grave
it seems about the most unlikely thing i could do but there it is
no i remember no emotion of any sort but just the clear feeling that one has from time to time when one hears that some mrs soandso is au mieux with a certain gentleman
it made things plainer suddenly to my curiosity
it was as if i thought at that moment of a windy november evening that when i came to think it over afterwards a dozen unexplained things would fit themselves into place
but i wasn't thinking things over then
i remember that distinctly
i was just sitting back rather stiffly in a deep armchair
that is what i remember
it was twilight
branshaw manor lies in a little hollow with lawns across it and pinewoods on the fringe of the dip
the immense wind coming from across the forest roared overhead
but the view from the window was perfectly quiet and grey
not a thing stirred except a couple of rabbits on the extreme edge of the lawn
it was leonora's own little study that we were in and we were waiting for the tea to be brought
i as i said was sitting in the deep chair leonora was standing in the window twirling the wooden acorn at the end of the windowblind cord desultorily round and round
she looked across the lawn and said as far as i can remember  edward has been dead only ten days and yet there are rabbits on the lawn
i understand that rabbits do a great deal of harm to the short grass in england
and then she turned round to me and said without any adornment at all for i remember her exact words  i think it was stupid of florence to commit suicide
i cannot tell you the extraordinary sense of leisure that we two seemed to have at that moment
it wasn't as if we were waiting for a train it wasn't as if we were waiting for a mealit was just that there was nothing to wait for
nothing
there was an extreme stillness with the remote and intermittent sound of the wind
there was the grey light in that brown small room
and there appeared to be nothing else in the world
i knew then that leonora was about to let me into her full confidence
it was as ifor no it was the actual fact thatleonora with an odd english sense of decency had determined to wait until edward had been in his grave for a full week before she spoke
and with some vague motive of giving her an idea of the extent to which she must permit herself to make confidences i said slowlyand these words too i remember with exactitudedid florence commit suicide
i didn't know
i was just you understand trying to let her know that if she were going to speak she would have to talk about a much wider range of things than she had before thought necessary
so that that was the first knowledge i had that florence had committed suicide
it had never entered my head
you may think that i had been singularly lacking in suspiciousness you may consider me even to have been an imbecile
but consider the position
in such circumstances of clamour of outcry of the crash of many people running together of the professional reticence of such people as hotelkeepers the traditional reticence of such good people as the ashburnhamsin such circumstances it is some little material object always that catches the eye and that appeals to the imagination
i had no possible guide to the idea of suicide and the sight of the little flask of nitrate of amyl in florence's hand suggested instantly to my mind the idea of the failure of her heart
nitrate of amyl you understand is the drug that is given to relieve sufferers from angina pectoris
seeing florence as i had seen her running with a white face and with one hand held over her heart and seeing her as i immediately afterwards saw her lying upon her bed with the so familiar little brown flask clenched in her fingers it was natural enough for my mind to frame the idea
as happened now and again i thought she had gone out without her remedy and having felt an attack coming on whilst she was in the gardens she had run in to get the nitrate in order as quickly as possible to obtain relief
and it was equally inevitable my mind should frame the thought that her heart unable to stand the strain of the running should have broken in her side
how could i have known that during all the years of our married life that little brown flask had contained not nitrate of amyl but prussic acid
it was inconceivable
why not even edward ashburnham who was after all more intimate with her than i was had an inkling of the truth
he just thought that she had dropped dead of heart disease
indeed i fancy that the only people who ever knew that florence had committed suicide were leonora the grand duke the head of the police and the hotelkeeper
i mention these last three because my recollection of that night is only the sort of pinkish effulgence from the electriclamps in the hotel lounge
there seemed to bob into my consciousness like floating globes the faces of those three
now it would be the bearded monarchical benevolent head of the grand duke then the sharpfeatured brown cavalrymoustached feature of the chief of police then the globular polished and highcollared vacuousness that represented monsieur schontz the proprietor of the hotel
at times one head would be there alone at another the spiked helmet of the official would be close to the healthy baldness of the prince then m schontz's oiled locks would push in between the two
the sovereign's soft exquisitely trained voice would say ja ja ja
each word dropping out like so many soft pellets of suet the subdued rasp of the official would come zum befehl durchlaucht like five revolvershots the voice of m schontz would go on and on under its breath like that of an unclean priest reciting from his breviary in the corner of a railwaycarriage
that was how it presented itself to me
they seemed to take no notice of me i don't suppose that i was even addressed by one of them
but as long as one or the other or all three of them were there they stood between me as if i being the titular possessor of the corpse had a right to be present at their conferences
then they all went away and i was left alone for a long time
and i thought nothing absolutely nothing
i had no ideas i had no strength
i felt no sorrow no desire for action no inclination to go upstairs and fall upon the body of my wife
i just saw the pink effulgence the cane tables the palms the globular matchholders the indented ashtrays
and then leonora came to me and it appears that i addressed to her that singular remark  now i can marry the girl
but i have given you absolutely the whole of my recollection of that evening as it is the whole of my recollection of the succeeding three or four days
i was in a state just simply cataleptic
they put me to bed and i stayed there they brought me my clothes and i dressed they led me to an open grave and i stood beside it
if they had taken me to the edge of a river or if they had flung me beneath a railway train i should have been drowned or mangled in the same spirit
i was the walking dead
well those are my impressions
what had actually happened had been this
i pieced it together afterwards
you will remember i said that edward ashburnham and the girl had gone off that night to a concert at the casino and that leonora had asked florence almost immediately after their departure to follow them and to perform the office of chaperone
florence you may also remember was all in black being the mourning that she wore for a deceased cousin jean hurlbird
it was a very black night and the girl was dressed in creamcoloured muslin that must have glimmered under the tall trees of the dark park like a phosphorescent fish in a cupboard
you couldn't have had a better beacon
and it appears that edward ashburnham led the girl not up the straight alle that leads to the casino but in under the dark trees of the park
edward ashburnham told me all this in his final outburst
i have told you that upon that occasion he became deucedly vocal
i didn't pump him
i hadn't any motive
at that time i didn't in the least connect him with my wife
but the fellow talked like a cheap novelistor like a very good novelist for the matter of that if it's the business of a novelist to make you see things clearly
and i tell you i see that thing as clearly as if it were a dream that never left me
it appears that not very far from the casino he and the girl sat down in the darkness upon a public bench
the lights from that place of entertainment must have reached them through the treetrunks since edward said he could quite plainly see the girl's facethat beloved face with the high forehead the queer mouth the tortured eyebrows and the direct eyes
and to florence creeping up behind them they must have presented the appearance of silhouettes
for i take it that florence came creeping up behind them over the short grass to a tree that i quite well remember was immediately behind that public seat
it was not a very difficult feat for a woman instinct with jealousy
the casino orchestra was as edward remembered to tell me playing the rakocsy march and although it was not loud enough at that distance to drown the voice of edward ashburnham it was certainly sufficiently audible to efface amongst the noises of the night the slight brushings and rustlings that might have been made by the feet of florence or by her gown in coming over the short grass
and that miserable woman must have got it in the face good and strong
it must have been horrible for her
horrible
well i suppose she deserved all that she got
anyhow there you have the picture the immensely tall trees elms most of them towering and feathering away up into the black mistiness that trees seem to gather about them at night the silhouettes of those two upon the seat the beams of light coming from the casino the woman all in black peeping with fear behind the treetrunk
it is melodrama but i can't help it
and then it appears something happened to edward ashburnham
he assured meand i see no reason for disbelieving himthat until that moment he had had no idea whatever of caring for the girl
he said that he had regarded her exactly as he would have regarded a daughter
he certainly loved her but with a very deep very tender and very tranquil love
he had missed her when she went away to her conventschool he had been glad when she had returned
but of more than that he had been totally unconscious
had he been conscious of it he assured me he would have fled from it as from a thing accursed
he realized that it was the last outrage upon leonora
but the real point was his entire unconsciousness
he had gone with her into that dark park with no quickening of the pulse with no desire for the intimacy of solitude
he had gone intending to talk about poloponies and tennisracquets about the temperament of the reverend mother at the convent she had left and about whether her frock for a party when they got home should be white or blue
it hadn't come into his head that they would talk about a single thing that they hadn't always talked about it had not even come into his head that the tabu which extended around her was not inviolable
and then suddenly thathe was very careful to assure me that at that time there was no physical motive about his declaration
it did not appear to him to be a matter of a dark night and a propinquity and so on
no it was simply of her effect on the moral side of his life that he appears to have talked
he said that he never had the slightest notion to enfold her in his arms or so much as to touch her hand
he swore that he did not touch her hand
he said that they sat she at one end of the bench he at the other he leaning slightly towards her and she looking straight towards the light of the casino her face illuminated by the lamps
the expression upon her face he could only describe as queer
at another time indeed he made it appear that he thought she was glad
it is easy to imagine that she was glad since at that time she could have had no idea of what was really happening
frankly she adored edward ashburnham
he was for her in everything that she said at that time the model of humanity the hero the athlete the father of his country the lawgiver
so that for her to be suddenly intimately and overwhelmingly praised must have been a matter for mere gladness however overwhelming it were
it must have been as if a god had approved her handiwork or a king her loyalty
she just sat still and listened smiling
and it seemed to her that all the bitterness of her childhood the terrors of her tempestuous father the bewailings of her crueltongued mother were suddenly atoned for
she had her recompense at last
because of course if you come to figure it out a sudden pouring forth of passion by a man whom you regard as a cross between a pastor and a father might to a woman have the aspect of mere praise for good conduct
it wouldn't i mean appear at all in the light of an attempt to gain possession
the girl at least regarded him as firmly anchored to his leonora
she had not the slightest inkling of any infidelities
he had always spoken to her of his wife in terms of reverence and deep affection
he had given her the idea that he regarded leonora as absolutely impeccable and as absolutely satisfying
their union had appeared to her to be one of those blessed things that are spoken of and contemplated with reverence by her church
so that when he spoke of her as being the person he cared most for in the world she naturally thought that he meant to except leonora and she was just glad
it was like a father saying that he approved of a marriageable daughter and edward when he realized what he was doing curbed his tongue at once
she was just glad and she went on being just glad
i suppose that that was the most monstrously wicked thing that edward ashburnham ever did in his life
and yet i am so near to all these people that i cannot think any of them wicked
it is impossible of me to think of edward ashburnham as anything but straight upright and honourable
that i mean is in spite of everything my permanent view of him
i try at times by dwelling on some of the things that he did to push that image of him away as you might try to push aside a large pendulum
but it always comes backthe memory of his innumerable acts of kindness of his efficiency of his unspiteful tongue
he was such a fine fellow
so i feel myself forced to attempt to excuse him in this as in so many other things
it is i have no doubt a most monstrous thing to attempt to corrupt a young girl just out of a convent
but i think edward had no idea at all of corrupting her
i believe that he simply loved her
he said that that was the way of it and i at least believe him and i believe too that she was the only woman he ever really loved
he said that that was so and he did enough to prove it
and leonora said that it was so and leonora knew him to the bottom of his heart
i have come to be very much of a cynic in these matters i mean that it is impossible to believe in the permanence of man's or woman's love
or at any rate it is impossible to believe in the permanence of any early passion
as i see it at least with regard to man a love affair a love for any definite womanis something in the nature of a widening of the experience
with each new woman that a man is attracted to there appears to come a broadening of the outlook or if you like an acquiring of new territory
a turn of the eyebrow a tone of the voice a queer characteristic gestureall these things and it is these things that cause to arise the passion of loveall these things are like so many objects on the horizon of the landscape that tempt a man to walk beyond the horizon to explore
he wants to get as it were behind those eyebrows with the peculiar turn as if he desired to see the world with the eyes that they overshadow
he wants to hear that voice applying itself to every possible proposition to every possible topic he wants to see those characteristic gestures against every possible background
of the question of the sexinstinct i know very little and i do not think that it counts for very much in a really great passion
it can be aroused by such nothingsby an untied shoelace by a glance of the eye in passingthat i think it might be left out of the calculation
i don't mean to say that any great passion can exist without a desire for consummation
that seems to me to be a commonplace and to be therefore a matter needing no comment at all
it is a thing with all its accidents that must be taken for granted as in a novel or a biography you take it for granted that the characters have their meals with some regularity
but the real fierceness of desire the real heat of a passion long continued and withering up the soul of a man is the craving for identity with the woman that he loves
he desires to see with the same eyes to touch with the same sense of touch to hear with the same ears to lose his identity to be enveloped to be supported
for whatever may be said of the relation of the sexes there is no man who loves a woman that does not desire to come to her for the renewal of his courage for the cutting asunder of his difficulties
and that will be the mainspring of his desire for her
we are all so afraid we are all so alone we all so need from the outside the assurance of our own worthiness to exist
so for a time if such a passion come to fruition the man will get what he wants
he will get the moral support the encouragement the relief from the sense of loneliness the assurance of his own worth
but these things pass away inevitably they pass away as the shadows pass across sundials
it is sad but it is so
the pages of the book will become familiar the beautiful corner of the road will have been turned too many times
well this is the saddest story
and yet i do believe that for every man there comes at last a womanor no that is the wrong way of formulating it
for every man there comes at last a time of life when the woman who then sets her seal upon his imagination has set her seal for good
he will travel over no more horizons he will never again set the knapsack over his shoulders he will retire from those scenes
he will have gone out of the business
that at any rate was the case with edward and the poor girl
it was quite literally the case
it was quite literally the case that his passionsfor the mistress of the grand duke for mrs basil for little mrs maidan for florence for whom you willthese passions were merely preliminary canters compared to his final race with death for her
i am certain of that
i am not going to be so american as to say that all true love demands some sacrifice
it doesn't
but i think that love will be truer and more permanent in which selfsacrifice has been exacted
and in the case of the other women edward just cut in and cut them out as he did with the poloball from under the nose of count baron von lelffel
i don't mean to say that he didn't wear himself as thin as a lath in the endeavour to capture the other women but over her he wore himself to rags and tatters and deathin the effort to leave her alone
and in speaking to her on that night he wasn't i am convinced committing a baseness
it was as if his passion for her hadn't existed as if the very words that he spoke without knowing that he spoke them created the passion as they went along
before he spoke there was nothing afterwards it was the integral fact of his life
well i must get back to my story
and my story was concerning itself with florencewith florence who heard those words from behind the tree
that of course is only conjecture but i think the conjecture is pretty well justified
you have the fact that those two went out that she followed them almost immediately afterwards through the darkness and a little later she came running back to the hotel with that pallid face and the hand clutching her dress over her heart
it can't have been only bagshawe
her face was contorted with agony before ever her eyes fell upon me or upon him beside me
but i dare say bagshawe may have been the determining influence in her suicide
leonora says that she had that flask apparently of nitrate of amyl but actually of prussic acid for many years and that she was determined to use it if ever i discovered the nature of her relationship with that fellow jimmy
you see the mainspring of her nature must have been vanity
there is no reason why it shouldn't have been i guess it is vanity that makes most of us keep straight if we do keep straight in this world
if it had been merely a matter of edward's relations with the girl i dare say florence would have faced it out
she would no doubt have made him scenes have threatened him have appealed to his sense of humour to his promises
but mr bagshawe and the fact that the date was the th of august must have been too much for her superstitious mind
you see she had two things that she wanted
she wanted to be a great lady installed in branshaw teleragh
she wanted also to retain my respect
she wanted that is to say to retain my respect for as long as she lived with me
i suppose if she had persuaded edward ashburnham to bolt with her she would have let the whole thing go with a run
or perhaps she would have tried to exact from me a new respect for the greatness of her passion on the lines of all for love and the world well lost
that would be just like florence
in all matrimonial associations there is i believe one constant factora desire to deceive the person with whom one lives as to some weak spot in one's character or in one's career
for it is intolerable to live constantly with one human being who perceives one's small meannesses
it is really death to do sothat is why so many marriages turn out unhappily
i for instance am a rather greedy man i have a taste for good cookery and a watering tooth at the mere sound of the names of certain comestibles
if florence had discovered this secret of mine i should have found her knowledge of it so unbearable that i never could have supported all the other privations of the rgime that she extracted from me
i am bound to say that florence never discovered this secret
certainly she never alluded to it i dare say she never took sufficient interest in me
and the secret weakness of florencethe weakness that she could not bear to have me discover was just that early escapade with the fellow called jimmy
let me as this is in all probability the last time i shall mention florence's name dwell a little upon the change that had taken place in her psychology
she would not i mean have minded if i had discovered that she was the mistress of edward ashburnham
she would rather have liked it
indeed the chief trouble of poor leonora in those days was to keep florence from making before me theatrical displays on one line or another of that very fact
she wanted in one mood to come rushing to me to cast herself on her knees at my feet and to declaim a carefully arranged frightfully emotional outpouring as to her passion
that was to show that she was like one of the great erotic women of whom history tells us
in another mood she would desire to come to me disdainfully and to tell me that i was considerably less than a man and that what had happened was what must happen when a real male came along
she wanted to say that in cool balanced and sarcastic sentences
that was when she wished to appear like the heroine of a french comedy
because of course she was always play acting
but what she didn't want me to know was the fact of her first escapade with the fellow called jimmy
she had arrived at figuring out the sort of lowdown bowery tough that that fellow was
do you know what it is to shudder in later life for some small stupid actionusually for some small quite genuine piece of emotionalismof your early life
well it was that sort of shuddering that came over florence at the thought that she had surrendered to such a low fellow
i don't know that she need have shuddered
it was her footling old uncle's work he ought never to have taken those two round the world together and shut himself up in his cabin for the greater part of the time
anyhow i am convinced that the sight of mr bagshawe and the thought that mr bagshawefor she knew that unpleasant and toadlike personalitythe thought that mr bagshawe would almost certainly reveal to me that he had caught her coming out of jimmy's bedroom at five o'clock in the morning on the th of august that was the determining influence in her suicide
and no doubt the effect of the date was too much for her superstitious personality
she had been born on the th of august she had started to go round the world on the th of august she had become a low fellow's mistress on the th of august
on the same day of the year she had married me on that th she had lost edward's love and bagshawe had appeared like a sinister omenlike a grin on the face of fate
it was the last straw
she ran upstairs arranged herself decoratively upon her bedshe was a sweetly pretty woman with smooth pink and white cheeks long hair the eyelashes falling like a tiny curtain on her cheeks
she drank the little phial of prussic acid and there she layoh extremely charming and clearcutlooking with a puzzled expression at the electriclight bulb that hung from the ceiling or perhaps through it to the stars above
who knows
anyhow there was an end of florence
you have no idea how quite extraordinarily for me that was the end of florence
from that day to this i have never given her another thought i have not bestowed upon her so much as a sigh
of course when it has been necessary to talk about her to leonora or when for the purpose of these writings i have tried to figure her out i have thought about her as i might do about a problem in algebra
but it has always been as a matter for study not for remembrance
she just went completely out of existence like yesterday's paper
i was so deadly tired
and i dare say that my week or ten days of affaissementof what was practically catalepsywas just the repose that my exhausted nature claimed after twelve years of the repression of my instincts after twelve years of playing the trained poodle
for that was all that i had been
i suppose that it was the shock that did itthe several shocks
but i am unwilling to attribute my feelings at that time to anything so concrete as a shock
it was a feeling so tranquil
it was as if an immensely heavyan unbearably heavy knapsack supported upon my shoulders by straps had fallen off and left my shoulders themselves that the straps had cut into numb and without sensation of life
i tell you i had no regret
what had i to regret
i suppose that my inner soulmy dual personalityhad realized long before that florence was a personality of paperthat she represented a real human being with a heart with feelings with sympathies and with emotions only as a banknote represents a certain quantity of gold
i know that sort of feeling came to the surface in me the moment the man bagshawe told me that he had seen her coming out of that fellow's bedroom
i thought suddenly that she wasn't real she was just a mass of talk out of guidebooks of drawings out of fashionplates
it is even possible that if that feeling had not possessed me i should have run up sooner to her room and might have prevented her drinking the prussic acid
but i just couldn't do it it would have been like chasing a scrap of paperan occupation ignoble for a grown man
and as it began so that matter has remained
i didn't care whether she had come out of that bedroom or whether she hadn't
it simply didn't interest me
florence didn't matter
i suppose you will retort that i was in love with nancy rufford and that my indifference was therefore discreditable
well i am not seeking to avoid discredit
i was in love with nancy rufford as i am in love with the poor child's memory quietly and quite tenderly in my american sort of way
i had never thought about it until i heard leonora state that i might now marry her
but from that moment until her worse than death i do not suppose that i much thought about anything else
i don't mean to say that i sighed about her or groaned i just wanted to marry her as some people want to go to carcassonne
do you understand the feelingthe sort of feeling that you must get certain matters out of the way smooth out certain fairly negligible complications before you can go to a place that has during all your life been a sort of dream city
i didn't attach much importance to my superior years
i was fortyfive and she poor thing was only just rising twentytwo
but she was older than her years and quieter
she seemed to have an odd quality of sainthood as if she must inevitably end in a convent with a white coif framing her face
but she had frequently told me that she had no vocation it just simply wasn't therethe desire to become a nun
well i guess that i was a sort of convent myself it seemed fairly proper that she should make her vows to me
no i didn't see any impediment on the score of age
i dare say no man does and i was pretty confident that with a little preparation i could make a young girl happy
i could spoil her as few young girls have ever been spoiled and i couldn't regard myself as personally repulsive
no man can or if he ever comes to do so that is the end of him
but as soon as i came out of my catalepsy i seemed to perceive that my problemthat what i had to do to prepare myself for getting into contact with her was just to get back into contact with life
i had been kept for twelve years in a rarefied atmosphere what i then had to do was a little fighting with real life some wrestling with men of business some travelling amongst larger cities something harsh something masculine
i didn't want to present myself to nancy rufford as a sort of an old maid
that was why just a fortnight after florence's suicide i set off for the united states
ii  immediately after florence's death leonora began to put the leash upon nancy rufford and edward
she had guessed what had happened under the trees near the casino
they stayed at nauheim some weeks after i went and leonora has told me that that was the most deadly time of her existence
it seemed like a long silent duel with invisible weapons so she said
and it was rendered all the more difficult by the girl's entire innocence
for nancy was always trying to go off alone with edwardas she had been doing all her life whenever she was home for holidays
she just wanted him to say nice things to her again
you see the position was extremely complicated
it was as complicated as it well could be along delicate lines
there was the complication caused by the fact that edward and leonora never spoke to each other except when other people were present
then as i have said their demeanours were quite perfect
there was the complication caused by the girl's entire innocence there was the further complication that both edward and leonora really regarded the girl as their daughter
or it might be more precise to say that they regarded her as being leonora's daughter
and nancy was a queer girl it is very difficult to describe her to you
she was tall and strikingly thin she had a tortured mouth agonized eyes and a quite extraordinary sense of fun
you might put it that at times she was exceedingly grotesque and at times extraordinarily beautiful
why she had the heaviest head of black hair that i have ever come across i used to wonder how she could bear the weight of it
she was just over twentyone and at times she seemed as old as the hills at times not much more than sixteen
at one moment she would be talking of the lives of the saints and at the next she would be tumbling all over the lawn with the st bernard puppy
she could ride to hounds like a maenad and she could sit for hours perfectly still steeping handkerchief after handkerchief in vinegar when leonora had one of her headaches
she was in short a miracle of patience who could be almost miraculously impatient
it was no doubt the convent training that effected that
i remember that one of her letters to me when she was about sixteen ran something like  on corpus christior it may have been some other saint's day i cannot keep these things in my headour school played roehampton at hockey
and seeing that our side was losing being three goals to one against us at halftime we retired into the chapel and prayed for victory
we won by five goals to three
and i remember that she seemed to describe afterwards a sort of saturnalia
apparently when the victorious fifteen or eleven came into the refectory for supper the whole school jumped upon the tables and cheered and broke the chairs on the floor and smashed the crockeryfor a given time until the reverend mother rang a handbell
that is of course the catholic traditionsaturnalia that can end in a moment like the crack of a whip
i don't of course like the tradition but i am bound to say that it gave nancyor at any rate nancy hada sense of rectitude that i have never seen surpassed
it was a thing like a knife that looked out of her eyes and that spoke with her voice just now and then
it positively frightened me
i suppose that i was almost afraid to be in a world where there could be so fine a standard
i remember when she was about fifteen or sixteen on going back to the convent i once gave her a couple of english sovereigns as a tip
she thanked me in a peculiarly heartfelt way saying that it would come in extremely handy
i asked her why and she explained
there was a rule at the school that the pupils were not to speak when they walked through the garden from the chapel to the refectory
and since this rule appeared to be idiotic and arbitrary she broke it on purpose day after day
in the evening the children were all asked if they had committed any faults during the day and every evening nancy confessed that she had broken this particular rule
it cost her sixpence a time that being the fine attached to the offence
just for the information i asked her why she always confessed and she answered in these exact words  oh well the girls of the holy child have always been noted for their truthfulness
it's a beastly bore but i've got to do it
i dare say that the miserable nature of her childhood coming before the mixture of saturnalia and discipline that was her convent life added something to her queernesses
her father was a violent madman of a fellow a major of one of what i believe are called the highland regiments
he didn't drink but he had an ungovernable temper and the first thing that nancy could remember was seeing her father strike her mother with his clenched fist so that her mother fell over sideways from the breakfasttable and lay motionless
the mother was no doubt an irritating woman and the privates of that regiment appeared to have been irritating too so that the house was a place of outcries and perpetual disturbances
mrs rufford was leonora's dearest friend and leonora could be cutting enough at times
but i fancy she was as nothing to mrs rufford
the major would come in to lunch harassed and already spitting out oaths after an unsatisfactory morning's drilling of his stubborn men beneath a hot sun
and then mrs rufford would make some cutting remark and pandemonium would break loose
once when she had been about twelve nancy had tried to intervene between the pair of them
her father had struck her full upon the forehead a blow so terrible that she had lain unconscious for three days
nevertheless nancy seemed to prefer her father to her mother
she remembered rough kindnesses from him
once or twice when she had been quite small he had dressed her in a clumsy impatient but very tender way
it was nearly always impossible to get a servant to stay in the family and for days at a time apparently mrs rufford would be incapable
i fancy she drank
at any rate she had so cutting a tongue that even nancy was afraid of hershe so made fun of any tenderness she so sneered at all emotional displays
nancy must have been a very emotional child
then one day quite suddenly on her return from a ride at fort william nancy had been sent with her governess who had a white face right down south to that convent school
she had been expecting to go there in two months' time
her mother disappeared from her life at that time
a fortnight later leonora came to the convent and told her that her mother was dead
perhaps she was
at any rate i never heard until the very end what became of mrs rufford
leonora never spoke of her
and then major rufford went to india from which he returned very seldom and only for very short visits and nancy lived herself gradually into the life at branshaw teleragh
i think that from that time onwards she led a very happy life till the end
there were dogs and horses and old servants and the forest
and there were edward and leonora who loved her
i had known her all the timei mean that she always came to the ashburnhams' at nauheim for the last fortnight of their stayand i watched her gradually growing
she was very cheerful with me
she always even kissed me night and morning until she was about eighteen
and she would skip about and fetch me things and laugh at my tales of life in philadelphia
but beneath her gaiety i fancy that there lurked some terrors
i remember one day when she was just eighteen during one of her father's rare visits to europe we were sitting in the gardens near the ironstained fountain
leonora had one of her headaches and we were waiting for florence and edward to come from their baths
you have no idea how beautiful nancy looked that morning
we were talking about the desirability of taking tickets in lotteriesof the moral side of it i mean
she was all in white and so tall and fragile and she had only just put her hair up so that the carriage of her neck had that charming touch of youth and of unfamiliarity
over her throat there played the reflection from a little pool of water left by a thunderstorm of the night before and all the rest of her features were in the diffused and luminous shade of her white parasol
her dark hair just showed beneath her broad white hat of pierced chip straw her throat was very long and leaned forward and her eyebrows arching a little as she laughed at some oldfashionedness in my phraseology had abandoned their tense line
and there was a little colour in her cheeks and light in her deep blue eyes
and to think that that vivid white thing that saintly and swanlike beingto think that why she was like the sail of a ship so white and so definite in her movements
and to think that she will never why she will never do anything again
i can't believe it
anyhow we were chattering away about the morality of lotteries
and then suddenly there came from the arcades behind us the overtones of her father's unmistakable voice it was as if a modified foghorn had boomed with a reed inside it
i looked round to catch sight of him
a tall fair stiffly upright man of fifty he was walking away with an italian baron who had had much to do with the belgian congo
they must have been talking about the proper treatment of natives for i heard him say  oh hang humanity
when i looked again at nancy her eyes were closed and her face was more pallid than her dress which had at least some pinkish reflections from the gravel
it was dreadful to see her with her eyes closed like that
oh
she exclaimed and her hand that had appeared to be groping settled for a moment on my arm
never speak of it
promise never to tell my father of it
it brings back those dreadful dreams and when she opened her eyes she looked straight into mine
the blessed saints she said you would think they would spare you such things
i don't believe all the sinning in the world could make one deserve them
they say the poor thing was always allowed a light at night even in her bedroom and yet no young girl could more archly and lovingly have played with an adored father
she was always holding him by both coat lapels crossquestioning him as to how he spent his time kissing the top of his head
ah she was wellbred if ever anyone was
the poor wretched man cringed before herbut she could not have done more to put him at his ease
perhaps she had had lessons in it at her convent
it was only that peculiar note of his voice used when he was overbearing or dogmatic that could unman herand that was only visible when it came unexpectedly
that was because the bad dreams that the blessed saints allowed her to have for her sins always seemed to her to herald themselves by the booming sound of her father's voice
it was that sound that had always preceded his entrance for the terrible lunches of her childhood 
i have reported earlier in this chapter that leonora said during that remainder of their stay at nauheim after i had left it had seemed to her that she was fighting a long duel with unseen weapons against silent adversaries
nancy as i have also said was always trying to go off with edward alone
that had been her habit for years
and leonora found it to be her duty to stop that
it was very difficult
nancy was used to having her own way and for years she had been used to going off with edward ratting rabbiting catching salmon down at fordingbridge districtvisiting of the sort that edward indulged in or calling on the tenants
and at nauheim she and edward had always gone up to the casino alone in the eveningsat any rate whenever florence did not call for his attendance
it shows the obviously innocent nature of the regard of those two that even florence had never had any idea of jealousy
leonora had cultivated the habit of going to bed at ten o'clock
i don't know how she managed it but for all the time they were at nauheim she contrived never to let those two be alone together except in broad daylight in very crowded places
if a protestant had done that it would no doubt have awakened a selfconsciousness in the girl
but catholics who have always reservations and queer spots of secrecy can manage these things better
and i dare say that two things made this easierthe death of florence and the fact that edward was obviously sickening
he appeared indeed to be very ill his shoulders began to be bowed there were pockets under his eyes he had extraordinary moments of inattention
and leonora describes herself as watching him as a fierce cat watches an unconscious pigeon in a roadway
in that silent watching again i think she was a catholicof a people that can think thoughts alien to ours and keep them to themselves
and the thoughts passed through her mind some of them even got through to edward with never a word spoken
at first she thought that it might be remorse or grief for the death of florence that was oppressing him
but she watched and watched and uttered apparently random sentences about florence before the girl and she perceived that he had no grief and no remorse
he had not any idea that florence could have committed suicide without writing at least a tirade to him
the absence of that made him certain that it had been heart disease
for florence had never undeceived him on that point
she thought it made her seem more romantic
no edward had no remorse
he was able to say to himself that he had treated florence with gallant attentiveness of the kind that she desired until two hours before her death
leonora gathered that from the look in his eyes and from the way he straightened his shoulders over her as she lay in her coffinfrom that and a thousand other little things
she would speak suddenly about florence to the girl and he would not start in the least he would not even pay attention but would sit with bloodshot eyes gazing at the tablecloth
he drank a good deal at that timea steady soaking of drink every evening till long after they had gone to bed
for leonora made the girl go to bed at ten unreasonable though that seemed to nancy
she would understand that whilst they were in a sort of half mourning for florence she ought not to be seen at public places like the casino but she could not see why she should not accompany her uncle upon his evening strolls though the park
i don't know what leonora put up as an excusesomething i fancy in the nature of a nightly orison that she made the girl and herself perform for the soul of florence
and then one evening about a fortnight later when the girl growing restive at even devotional exercises clamoured once more to be allowed to go for a walk with edward and when leonora was really at her wits' end edward gave himself into her hands
he was just standing up from dinner and had his face averted
but he turned his heavy head and his bloodshot eyes upon his wife and looked full at her
doctor von hauptmann he said has ordered me to go to bed immediately after dinner
my heart's much worse
he continued to look at leonora for a long minutewith a sort of heavy contempt
and leonora understood that with his speech he was giving her the excuse that she needed for separating him from the girl and with his eyes he was reproaching her for thinking that he would try to corrupt nancy
he went silently up to his room and sat there for a long timeuntil the girl was well in bedreading in the anglican prayerbook
and about halfpast ten she heard his footsteps pass her door going outwards
two and a half hours later they came back stumbling heavily
she remained reflecting upon this position until the last night of their stay at nauheim
then she suddenly acted
for just in the same way suddenly after dinner she looked at him and said  teddy don't you think you could take a night off from your doctor's orders and go with nancy to the casino
the poor child has had her visit so spoiled
he looked at her in turn for a long balancing minute
why yes he said at last
nancy jumped out of her chair and kissed him
those two words leonora said gave her the greatest relief of any two syllables she had ever heard in her life
for she realized that edward was breaking up not under the desire for possession but from the dogged determination to hold his hand
she could relax some of her vigilance
nevertheless she sat in the darkness behind her halfclosed jalousies looking over the street and the night and the trees until very late she could hear nancy's clear voice coming closer and saying  you did look an old guy with that false nose
there had been some sort of celebration of a local holiday up in the kursaal
and edward replied with his sort of sulky good nature  as for you you looked like old mother sideacher
the girl came swinging along a silhouette beneath a gaslamp edward another slouched at her side
they were talking just as they had talked any time since the girl had been seventeen with the same tones the same joke about an old beggar woman who always amused them at branshaw
the girl a little later opened leonora's door whilst she was still kissing edward on the forehead as she had done every night
we've had a most glorious time she said
he's ever so much better
he raced me for twenty yards home
why are you all in the dark
leonora could hear edward going about in his room but owing to the girl's chatter she could not tell whether he went out again or not
and then very much later because she thought that if he were drinking again something must be done to stop it she opened for the first time and very softly the neveropened door between their rooms
she wanted to see if he had gone out again
edward was kneeling beside his bed with his head hidden in the counterpane
his arms outstretched held out before him a little image of the blessed virgina tawdry scarlet and prussian blue affair that the girl had given him on her first return from the convent
his shoulders heaved convulsively three times and heavy sobs came from him before she could close the door
he was not a catholic but that was the way it took him
leonora slept for the first time that night with a sleep from which she never once started
iii  and then leonora completely broke downon the day that they returned to branshaw teleragh
it is the infliction of our miserable mindsit is the scourge of atrocious but probably just destiny that no grief comes by itself
no any great grief though the grief itself may have gone leaves in its place a train of horrors of misery and despair
for leonora was in herself relieved
she felt that she could trust edward with the girl and she knew that nancy could be absolutely trusted
and then with the slackening of her vigilance came the slackening of her entire mind
this is perhaps the most miserable part of the entire story
for it is miserable to see a clean intelligence waver and leonora wavered
you are to understand that leonora loved edward with a passion that was yet like an agony of hatred
and she had lived with him for years and years without addressing to him one word of tenderness
i don't know how she could do it
at the beginning of that relationship she had been just married off to him
she had been one of seven daughters in a bare untidy irish manorhouse to which she had returned from the convent i have so often spoken of
she had left it just a year and she was just nineteen
it is impossible to imagine such inexperience as was hers
you might almost say that she had never spoken to a man except a priest
coming straight from the convent she had gone in behind the high walls of the manorhouse that was almost more cloistral than any convent could have been
there were the seven girls there was the strained mother there was the worried father at whom three times in the course of that year the tenants took potshots from behind a hedge
the womenfolk upon the whole the tenants respected
once a week each of the girls since there were seven of them took a drive with the mother in the old basketwork chaise drawn by a very fat very lumbering pony
they paid occasionally a call but even these were so rare that leonora has assured me only three times in the year that succeeded her coming home from the convent did she enter another person's house
for the rest of the time the seven sisters ran about in the neglected gardens between the unpruned espaliers
or they played lawntennis or fives in an angle of a great wall that surrounded the gardenan angle from which the fruit trees had long died away
they painted in watercolour they embroidered they copied verses into albums
once a week they went to mass once a week to the confessional accompanied by an old nurse
they were happy since they had known no other life
it appeared to them a singular extravagance when one day a photographer was brought over from the county town and photographed them standing all seven in the shadow of an old apple tree with the grey lichen on the raddled trunk
but it wasn't an extravagance
three weeks before colonel powys had written to colonel ashburnham  i say harry couldn't your edward marry one of my girls
it would be a godsend to me for i'm at the end of my tether and once one girl begins to go off the rest of them will follow
he went on to say that all his daughters were tall upstanding cleanlimbed and absolutely pure and he reminded colonel ashburnham that they having been married on the same day though in different churches since the one was a catholic and the other an anglicanthey had said to each other the night before that when the time came one of their sons should marry one of their daughters
mrs ashburnham had been a powys and remained mrs powys' dearest friend
they had drifted about the world as english soldiers do seldom meeting but their women always in correspondence one with another
they wrote about minute things such as the teething of edward and of the earlier daughters or the best way to repair a jacob's ladder in a stocking
and if they met seldom yet it was often enough to keep each other's personalities fresh in their minds gradually growing a little stiff in the joints but always with enough to talk about and with a store of reminiscences
then as his girls began to come of age when they must leave the convent in which they were regularly interned during his years of active service colonel powys retired from the army with the necessity of making a home for them
it happened that the ashburnhams had never seen any of the powys girls though whenever the four parents met in london edward ashburnham was always of the party
he was at that time twentytwo and i believe almost as pure in mind as leonora herself
it is odd how a boy can have his virgin intelligence untouched in this world
that was partly due to the careful handling of his mother partly to the fact that the house to which he went at winchester had a particularly pure tone and partly to edward's own peculiar aversion from anything like coarse language or gross stories
at sandhurst he had just kept out of the way of that sort of thing
he was keen on soldiering keen on mathematics on landsurveying on politics and by a queer warp of his mind on literature
even when he was twentytwo he would pass hours reading one of scott's novels or the chronicles of froissart
mrs ashburnham considered that she was to be congratulated and almost every week she wrote to mrs powys dilating upon her satisfaction
then one day taking a walk down bond street with her son after having been at lord's she noticed edward suddenly turn his head round to take a second look at a welldressed girl who had passed them
she wrote about that too to mrs powys and expressed some alarm
it had been on edward's part the merest reflex action
he was so very abstracted at that time owing to the pressure his crammer was putting upon him that he certainly hadn't known what he was doing
it was this letter of mrs ashburnham's to mrs powys that had caused the letter from colonel powys to colonel ashburnhama letter that was halfhumorous half longing
mrs ashburnham caused her husband to reply with a letter a little more jocularsomething to the effect that colonel powys ought to give them some idea of the goods that he was marketing
that was the cause of the photograph
i have seen it the seven girls all in white dresses all very much alike in featureall except leonora a little heavy about the chins and a little stupid about the eyes
i dare say it would have made leonora too look a little heavy and a little stupid for it was not a good photograph
but the black shadow from one of the branches of the apple tree cut right across her face which is all but invisible
there followed an extremely harassing time for colonel and mrs powys
mrs ashburnham had written to say that quite sincerely nothing would give greater ease to her maternal anxieties than to have her son marry one of mrs powys' daughters if only he showed some inclination to do so
for she added nothing but a lovematch was to be thought of in her edward's case
but the poor powys couple had to run things so very fine that even the bringing together of the young people was a desperate hazard
the mere expenditure upon sending one of the girls over from ireland to branshaw was terrifying to them and whichever girl they selected might not be the one to ring edward's bell
on the other hand the expenditure upon mere food and extra sheets for a visit from the ashburnhams to them was terrifying too
it would mean mathematically going short in so many meals themselves afterwards
nevertheless they chanced it and all the three ashburnhams came on a visit to the lonely manorhouse
they could give edward some rough shooting some rough fishing and a whirl of femininity but i should say the girls made really more impression upon mrs ashburnham than upon edward himself
they appeared to her to be so clean run and so safe
they were indeed so clean run that in a faint sort of way edward seems to have regarded them rather as boys than as girls
and then one evening mrs ashburnham had with her boy one of those conversations that english mothers have with english sons
it seems to have been a criminal sort of proceeding though i don't know what took place at it
anyhow next morning colonel ashburnham asked on behalf of his son for the hand of leonora
this caused some consternation to the powys couple since leonora was the third daughter and edward ought to have married the eldest
mrs powys with her rigid sense of the proprieties almost wished to reject the proposal
but the colonel her husband pointed out that the visit would have cost them sixty pounds what with the hire of an extra servant of a horse and car and with the purchase of beds and bedding and extra tablecloths
there was nothing else for it but the marriage
in that way edward and leonora became man and wife
i don't know that a very minute study of their progress towards complete disunion is necessary
perhaps it is
but there are many things that i cannot well make out about which i cannot well question leonora or about which edward did not tell me
i do not know that there was ever any question of love from edward to her
he regarded her certainly as desirable amongst her sisters
he was obstinate to the extent of saying that if he could not have her he would not have any of them
and no doubt before the marriage he made her pretty speeches out of books that he had read
but as far as he could describe his feelings at all later it seems that calmly and without any quickening of the pulse he just carried the girl off there being no opposition
it had however been all so long ago that it seemed to him at the end of his poor life a dim and misty affair
he had the greatest admiration for leonora
he had the very greatest admiration
he admired her for her truthfulness for her cleanness of mind and the cleanrunness of her limbs for her efficiency for the fairness of her skin for the gold of her hair for her religion for her sense of duty
it was a satisfaction to take her about with him
but she had not for him a touch of magnetism
i suppose really he did not love her because she was never mournful what really made him feel good in life was to comfort somebody who would be darkly and mysteriously mournful
that he had never had to do for leonora
perhaps also she was at first too obedient
i do not mean to say that she was submissivethat she deferred in her judgements to his
she did not
but she had been handed over to him like some patient medieval virgin she had been taught all her life that the first duty of a woman is to obey
and there she was
in her at least admiration for his qualities very soon became love of the deepest description
if his pulses never quickened she so i have been told became what is called an altered being when he approached her from the other side of a dancingfloor
her eyes followed him about full of trustfulness of admiration of gratitude and of love
he was also in a great sense her pastor and guideand he guided her into what for a girl straight out of a convent was almost heaven
i have not the least idea of what an english officer's wife's existence may be like
at any rate there were feasts and chatterings and nice men who gave her the right sort of admiration and nice women who treated her as if she had been a baby
and her confessor approved of her life and edward let her give little treats to the girls of the convent she had left and the reverend mother approved of him
there could not have been a happier girl for five or six years
for it was only at the end of that time that clouds began as the saying is to arise
she was then about twentythree and her purposeful efficiency made her perhaps have a desire for mastery
she began to perceive that edward was extravagant in his largesses
his parents died just about that time and edward though they both decided that he should continue his soldiering gave a great deal of attention to the management of branshaw through a steward
aldershot was not very far away and they spent all his leaves there
and suddenly she seemed to begin to perceive that his generosities were almost fantastic
he subscribed much too much to things connected with his mess he pensioned off his father's servants old or new much too generously
they had a large income but every now and then they would find themselves hard up
he began to talk of mortgaging a farm or two though it never actually came to that
she made tentative efforts at remonstrating with him
her father whom she saw now and then said that edward was much too generous to his tenants the wives of his brother officers remonstrated with her in private his large subscriptions made it difficult for their husbands to keep up with them
ironically enough the first real trouble between them came from his desire to build a roman catholic chapel at branshaw
he wanted to do it to honour leonora and he proposed to do it very expensively
leonora did not want it she could perfectly well drive from branshaw to the nearest catholic church as often as she liked
there were no roman catholic tenants and no roman catholic servants except her old nurse who could always drive with her
she had as many priests to stay with her as could be neededand even the priests did not want a gorgeous chapel in that place where it would have merely seemed an invidious instance of ostentation
they were perfectly ready to celebrate mass for leonora and her nurse when they stayed at branshaw in a cleanedup outhouse
but edward was as obstinate as a hog about it
he was truly grieved at his wife's want of sentimentat her refusal to receive that amount of public homage from him
she appeared to him to be wanting in imaginationto be cold and hard
i don't exactly know what part her priests played in the tragedy that it all became i dare say they behaved quite creditably but mistakenly
but then who would not have been mistaken with edward
i believe he was even hurt that leonora's confessor did not make strenuous efforts to convert him
there was a period when he was quite ready to become an emotional catholic
i don't know why they did not take him on the hop but they have queer sorts of wisdoms those people and queer sorts of tact
perhaps they thought that edward's too early conversion would frighten off other protestant desirables from marrying catholic girls
perhaps they saw deeper into edward than he saw himself and thought that he would make a not very creditable convert
at any rate theyand leonoraleft him very much alone
it mortified him very considerably
he has told me that if leonora had then taken his aspirations seriously everything would have been different
but i dare say that was nonsense
at any rate it was over the question of the chapel that they had their first and really disastrous quarrel
edward at that time was not well he supposed himself to be overworked with his regimental affairshe was managing the mess at the time
and leonora was not wellshe was beginning to fear that their union might be sterile
and then her father came over from glasmoyle to stay with them
those were troublesome times in ireland i understand
at any rate colonel powys had tenants on the brainhis own tenants having shot at him with shotguns
and in conversation with edward's landsteward he got it into his head that edward managed his estates with a mad generosity towards his tenants
i understand also that those yearsthe 'ninetieswere very bad for farming
wheat was fetching only a few shillings the hundred the price of meat was so low that cattle hardly paid for raising whole english counties were ruined
and edward allowed his tenants very high rebates
to do both justice leonora has since acknowledged that she was in the wrong at that time and that edward was following out a more farseeing policy in nursing his really very good tenants over a bad period
it was not as if the whole of his money came from the land a good deal of it was in rails
but old colonel powys had that bee in his bonnet and if he never directly approached edward himself on the subject he preached unceasingly whenever he had the opportunity to leonora
his pet idea was that edward ought to sack all his own tenants and import a set of farmers from scotland
that was what they were doing in essex
he was of opinion that edward was riding hotfoot to ruin
that worried leonora very muchit worried her dreadfully she lay awake nights she had an anxious line round her mouth
and that again worried edward
i do not mean to say that leonora actually spoke to edward about his tenantsbut he got to know that some one probably her father had been talking to her about the matter
he got to know it because it was the habit of his steward to look in on them every morning about breakfasttime to report any little happenings
and there was a farmer called mumford who had only paid half his rent for the last three years
one morning the landsteward reported that mumford would be unable to pay his rent at all that year
edward reflected for a moment and then he said something like  oh well he's an old fellow and his family have been our tenants for over two hundred years
let him off altogether
and then leonorayou must remember that she had reason for being very nervous and unhappy at that timelet out a sound that was very like a groan
it startled edward who more than suspected what was passing in her mindit startled him into a state of anger
he said sharply  you wouldn't have me turn out people who've been earning money for us for centuriespeople to whom we have responsibilitiesand let in a pack of scotch farmers
he looked at her leonora said with what was practically a glance of hatred and then precipitately he left the breakfasttable
leonora knew that it probably made it all the worse that he had been betrayed into a manifestation of anger before a third party
it was the first and last time that he ever was betrayed into such a manifestation of anger
the landsteward a moderate and wellbalanced man whose family also had been with the ashburnhams for over a century took it upon himself to explain that he considered edward was pursuing a perfectly proper course with his tenants
he erred perhaps a little on the side of generosity but hard times were hard times and every one had to feel the pinch landlord as well as tenants
the great thing was not to let the land get into a poor state of cultivation
scotch farmers just skinned your fields and let them go down and down
but edward had a very good set of tenants who did their best for him and for themselves
these arguments at that time carried very little conviction to leonora
she was nevertheless much concerned by edward's outburst of anger
the fact is that leonora had been practising economies in her department
two of the underhousemaids had gone and she had not replaced them she had spent much less that year upon dress
the fare she had provided at the dinners they gave had been much less bountiful and not nearly so costly as had been the case in preceding years and edward began to perceive a hardness and determination in his wife's character
he seemed to see a net closing round hima net in which they would be forced to live like one of the comparatively poor county families of the neighbourhood
and in the mysterious way in which two people living together get to know each other's thoughts without a word spoken he had known even before his outbreak that leonora was worrying about his managing of the estates
this appeared to him to be intolerable
he had too a great feeling of selfcontempt because he had been betrayed into speaking harshly to leonora before that landsteward
she imagined that his nerve must be deserting him and there can have been few men more miserable than edward was at that period
you see he was really a very simple soulvery simple
he imagined that no man can satisfactorily accomplish his life's work without loyal and wholehearted cooperation of the woman he lives with
and he was beginning to perceive dimly that whereas his own traditions were entirely collective his wife was a sheer individualist
his own theorythe feudal theory of an overlord doing his best by his dependents the dependents meanwhile doing their best for the overlordthis theory was entirely foreign to leonora's nature
she came of a family of small irish landlordsthat hostile garrison in a plundered country
and she was thinking unceasingly of the children she wished to have
i don't know why they never had any childrennot that i really believe that children would have made any difference
the dissimilarity of edward and leonora was too profound
it will give you some idea of the extraordinary navet of edward ashburnham that at the time of his marriage and for perhaps a couple of years after he did not really know how children are produced
neither did leonora
i don't mean to say that this state of things continued but there it was
i dare say it had a good deal of influence on their mentalities
at any rate they never had a child
it was the will of god
it certainly presented itself to leonora as being the will of godas being a mysterious and awful chastisement of the almighty
for she had discovered shortly before this period that her parents had not exacted from edward's family the promise that any children she should bear should be brought up as catholics
she herself had never talked of the matter with either her father her mother or her husband
when at last her father had let drop some words leading her to believe that that was the fact she tried desperately to extort the promise from edward
she encountered an unexpected obstinacy
edward was perfectly willing that the girls should be catholic the boys must be anglican
i don't understand the bearing of these things in english society
indeed englishmen seem to me to be a little mad in matters of politics or of religion
in edward it was particularly queer because he himself was perfectly ready to become a romanist
he seemed however to contemplate going over to rome himself and yet letting his boys be educated in the religion of their immediate ancestors
this may appear illogical but i dare say it is not so illogical as it looks
edward that is to say regarded himself as having his own body and soul at his own disposal
but his loyalty to the traditions of his family would not permit him to bind any future inheritors of his name or beneficiaries by the death of his ancestors
about the girls it did not so much matter
they would know other homes and other circumstances
besides it was the usual thing
but the boys must be given the opportunity of choosingand they must have first of all the anglican teaching
he was perfectly unshakable about this
leonora was in an agony during all this time
you will have to remember she seriously believed that children who might be born to her went in danger if not absolutely of damnation at any rate of receiving false doctrine
it was an agony more terrible than she could describe
she didn't indeed attempt to describe it but i could tell from her voice when she said almost negligently i used to lie awake whole nights
it was no good my spiritual advisers trying to console me
i knew from her voice how terrible and how long those nights must have seemed and of how little avail were the consolations of her spiritual advisers
her spiritual advisers seemed to have taken the matter a little more calmly
they certainly told her that she must not consider herself in any way to have sinned
nay they seem even to have extorted to have threatened her with a view to getting her out of what they considered to be a morbid frame of mind
she would just have to make the best of things to influence the children when they came not by propaganda but by personality
and they warned her that she would be committing a sin if she continued to think that she had sinned
nevertheless she continued to think that she had sinned
leonora could not be aware that the man whom she loved passionately and whom nevertheless she was beginning to try to rule with a rod of ironthat this man was becoming more and more estranged from her
he seemed to regard her as being not only physically and mentally cold but even as being actually wicked and mean
there were times when he would almost shudder if she spoke to him
and she could not understand how he could consider her wicked or mean
it only seemed to her a sort of madness in him that he should try to take upon his own shoulders the burden of his troop of his regiment of his estate and of half of his country
she could not see that in trying to curb what she regarded as megalomania she was doing anything wicked
she was just trying to keep things together for the sake of the children who did not come
and little by little the whole of their intercourse became simply one of agonized discussion as to whether edward should subscribe to this or that institution or should try to reclaim this or that drunkard
she simply could not see it
into this really terrible position of strain from which there appeared to be no issue the kilsyte case came almost as a relief
it is part of the peculiar irony of things that edward would certainly never have kissed that nursemaid if he had not been trying to please leonora
nursemaids do not travel firstclass and that day edward travelled in a thirdclass carriage in order to prove to leonora that he was capable of economies
i have said that the kilsyte case came almost as a relief to the strained situation that then existed between them
it gave leonora an opportunity of backing him up in a wholehearted and absolutely loyal manner
it gave her the opportunity of behaving to him as he considered a wife should behave to her husband
you see edward found himself in a railway carriage with a quite pretty girl of about nineteen
and the quite pretty girl of about nineteen with dark hair and red cheeks and blue eyes was quietly weeping
edward had been sitting in his corner thinking about nothing at all
he had chanced to look at the nursemaid two large pretty tears came out of her eyes and dropped into her lap
he immediately felt that he had got to do something to comfort her
that was his job in life
he was desperately unhappy himself and it seemed to him the most natural thing in the world that they should pool their sorrows
he was quite democratic the idea of the difference in their station never seems to have occurred to him
he began to talk to her
he discovered that her young man had been seen walking out with annie of number 
he moved over to her side of the carriage
he told her that the report probably wasn't true that after all a young man might take a walk with annie from number  without its denoting anything very serious
and he assured me that he felt at least quite halffatherly when he put his arm around her waist and kissed her
the girl however had not forgotten the difference of her station
all her life by her mother by other girls by schoolteachers by the whole tradition of her class she had been warned against gentlemen
she was being kissed by a gentleman
she screamed tore herself away sprang up and pulled a communication cord
edward came fairly well out of the affair in the public estimation but it did him mentally a good deal of harm
iv  it is very difficult to give an allround impression of a man
i wonder how far i have succeeded with edward ashburnham
i dare say i haven't succeeded at all
it is ever very difficult to see how such things matter
was it the important point about poor edward that he was very well built carried himself well was moderate at the table and led a regular lifethat he had in fact all the virtues that are usually accounted english
or have i in the least succeeded in conveying that he was all those things and had all those virtues
he certainly was them and had them up to the last months of his life
they were the things that one would set upon his tombstone
they will indeed be set upon his tombstone by his widow
and have i i wonder given the due impression of how his life was portioned and his time laid out
because until the very last the amount of time taken up by his various passions was relatively small
i have been forced to write very much about his passions but you have to consideri should like to be able to make you considerthat he rose every morning at seven took a cold bath breakfasted at eight was occupied with his regiment from nine until one played polo or cricket with the men when it was the season for cricket till teatime
afterwards he would occupy himself with the letters from his landsteward or with the affairs of his mess till dinnertime
he would dine and pass the evening playing cards or playing billiards with leonora or at social functions of one kind or another
and the greater part of his life was taken up by thatby far the greater part of his life
his loveaffairs until the very end were sandwiched in at odd moments or took place during the social evenings the dances and dinners
but i guess i have made it hard for you o silent listener to get that impression
anyhow i hope i have not given you the idea that edward ashburnham was a pathological case
he wasn't
he was just a normal man and very much of a sentimentalist
i dare say the quality of his youth the nature of his mother's influence his ignorances the crammings that he received at the hands of army coachesi dare say that all these excellent influences upon his adolescence were very bad for him
but we all have to put up with that sort of thing and no doubt it is very bad for all of us
nevertheless the outline of edward's life was an outline perfectly normal of the life of a hardworking sentimental and efficient professional man
that question of first impressions has always bothered me a good dealbut quite academically
i mean that from time to time i have wondered whether it were or were not best to trust to one's first impressions in dealing with people
but i never had anybody to deal with except waiters and chambermaids and the ashburnhams with whom i didn't know that i was having any dealings
and as far as waiters and chambermaids were concerned i have generally found that my first impressions were correct enough
if my first idea of a man was that he was civil obliging and attentive he generally seemed to go on being all those things
once however at our paris flat we had a maid who appeared to be charming and transparently honest
she stole nevertheless one of florence's diamond rings
she did it however to save her young man from going to prison
so here as somebody says somewhere was a special case
and even in my short incursion into american business lifean incursion that lasted during part of august and nearly the whole of septemberi found that to rely upon first impressions was the best thing i could do
i found myself automatically docketing and labelling each man as he was introduced to me by the run of his features and by the first words that he spoke
i can't however be regarded as really doing business during the time that i spent in the united states
i was just winding things up
if it hadn't been for my idea of marrying the girl i might possibly have looked for something to do in my own country
for my experiences there were vivid and amusing
it was exactly as if i had come out of a museum into a riotous fancydress ball
during my life with florence i had almost come to forget that there were such things as fashions or occupations or the greed of gain
i had in fact forgotten that there was such a thing as a dollar and that a dollar can be extremely desirable if you don't happen to possess one
and i had forgotten too that there was such a thing as gossip that mattered
in that particular philadelphia was the most amazing place i have ever been in in my life
i was not in that city for more than a week or ten days and i didn't there transact anything much in the way of business nevertheless the number of times that i was warned by everybody against everybody else was simply amazing
a man i didn't know would come up behind my lounge chair in the hotel and whispering cautiously beside my ear would warn me against some other man that i equally didn't know but who would be standing by the bar
i don't know what they thought i was there to doperhaps to buy out the city's debt or get a controlling hold of some railway interest
or perhaps they imagined that i wanted to buy a newspaper for they were either politicians or reporters which of course comes to the same thing
as a matter of fact my property in philadelphia was mostly real estate in the oldfashioned part of the city and all i wanted to do there was just to satisfy myself that the houses were in good repair and the doors kept properly painted
i wanted also to see my relations of whom i had a few
these were mostly professional people and they were mostly rather hard up because of the big bank failure in  or thereabouts
still they were very nice
they would have been nicer still if they hadn't all of them had what appeared to me to be the mania that what they called influences were working against them
at any rate the impression of that city was one of oldfashioned rooms rather english than american in type in which handsome but careworn ladies cousins of my own talked principally about mysterious movements that were going on against them
i never got to know what it was all about perhaps they thought i knew or perhaps there weren't any movements at all
it was all very secret and subtle and subterranean
but there was a nice young fellow called carter who was a sort of secondnephew of mine twice removed
he was handsome and dark and gentle and tall and modest
i understand also that he was a good cricketer
he was employed by the realestate agents who collected my rents
it was he therefore who took me over my own property and i saw a good deal of him and of a nice girl called mary to whom he was engaged
at that time i did what i certainly shouldn't do nowi made some careful inquiries as to his character
i discovered from his employers that he was just all that he appeared honest industrious highspirited friendly and ready to do anyone a good turn
his relatives however as they were mine tooseemed to have something darkly mysterious against him
i imagined that he must have been mixed up in some case of graft or that he had at least betrayed several innocent and trusting maidens
i pushed however that particular mystery home and discovered it was only that he was a democrat
my own people were mostly republicans
it seemed to make it worse and more darkly mysterious to them that young carter was what they called a sort of a vermont democrat which was the whole ticket and no mistake
but i don't know what it means
anyhow i suppose that my money will go to him when i diei like the recollection of his friendly image and of the nice girl he was engaged to
may fate deal very kindly with them
i have said just now that in my present frame of mind nothing would ever make me make inquiries as to the character of any man that i liked at first sight
the little digression as to my philadelphia experiences was really meant to lead around to this
for who in this world can give anyone a character
who in this world knows anything of any other heartor of his own
i don't mean to say that one cannot form an average estimate of the way a person will behave
but one cannot be certain of the way any man will behave in every caseand until one can do that a character is of no use to anyone
that for instance was the way with florence's maid in paris
we used to trust that girl with blank cheques for the payment of the tradesmen
for quite a time she was so trusted by us
then suddenly she stole a ring
we should not have believed her capable of it she would not have believed herself capable of it
it was nothing in her character
so perhaps it was with edward ashburnham
or perhaps it wasn't
no i rather think it wasn't
it is difficult to figure out
i have said that the kilsyte case eased the immediate tension for him and leonora
it let him see that she was capable of loyalty to him it gave her her chance to show that she believed in him
she accepted without question his statement that in kissing the girl he wasn't trying to do more than administer fatherly comfort to a weeping child
and indeed his own worldincluding the magistratestook that view of the case
whatever people say one's world can be perfectly charitable at times
but again as i have said it did edward a great deal of harm
that at least was his view of it
he assured me that before that case came on and was wrangled about by counsel with all sorts of dirtymindedness that counsel in that sort of case can impute he had not had the least idea that he was capable of being unfaithful to leonora
but in the midst of that tumulthe says that it came suddenly into his head whilst he was in the witnessboxin the midst of those august ceremonies of the law there came suddenly into his mind the recollection of the softness of the girl's body as he had pressed her to him
and from that moment that girl appeared desirable to himand leonora completely unattractive
he began to indulge in daydreams in which he approached the nursemaid more tactfully and carried the matter much further
occasionally he thought of other women in terms of wary courtshipor perhaps it would be more exact to say that he thought of them in terms of tactful comforting ending in absorption
that was his own view of the case
he saw himself as the victim of the law
i don't mean to say that he saw himself as a kind of dreyfus
the law practically was quite kind to him
it stated that in its view captain ashburnham had been misled by an illplaced desire to comfort a member of the opposite sex and it fined him five shilling for his want of tact or of knowledge of the world
but edward maintained that it had put ideas into his head
i don't believe it though he certainly did
he was twentyseven then and his wife was out of sympathy with himsome crash was inevitable
there was between them a momentary rapprochement but it could not last
it made it probably all the worse that in that particular matter leonara had come so very well up to the scratch
for whilst edward respected her more and was grateful to her it made her seem by so much the more cold in other matters that were near his hearthis responsibilities his career his tradition
it brought his despair of her up to a point of exasperationand it riveted on him the idea that he might find some other woman who would give him the moral support that he needed
he wanted to be looked upon as a sort of lohengrin
at that time he says he went about deliberately looking for some woman who could help him
he found severalfor there were quite a number of ladies in his set who were capable of agreeing with this handsome and fine fellow that the duties of a feudal gentleman were feudal
he would have liked to pass his days talking to one or other of these ladies
but there was always an obstacleif the lady were married there would be a husband who claimed the greater part of her time and attention
if on the other hand it were an unmarried girl he could not see very much of her for fear of compromising her
at that date you understand he had not the least idea of seducing any one of these ladies
he wanted only moral support at the hands of some female because he found men difficult to talk to about ideals
indeed i do not believe that he had at any time any idea of making any one his mistress
that sounds queer but i believe it is quite true as a statement of character
it was i believe one of leonora's priestsa man of the worldwho suggested that she should take him to monte carlo
he had the idea that what edward needed in order to fit him for the society of leonora was a touch of irresponsibility
for edward at that date had much the aspect of a prig
i mean that if he played polo and was an excellent dancer he did the one for the sake of keeping himself fit and the other because it was a social duty to show himself at dances and when there to dance well
he did nothing for fun except what he considered to be his work in life
as the priest saw it this must for ever estrange him from leonoranot because leonora set much store by the joy of life but because she was out of sympathy with edward's work
on the other hand leonora did like to have a good time now and then and as the priest saw it if edward could be got to like having a good time now and then too there would be a bond of sympathy between them
it was a good idea but it worked out wrongly
it worked out in fact in the mistress of the grand duke
in anyone less sentimental than edward that would not have mattered
with edward it was fatal
for such was his honourable nature that for him to enjoy a woman's favours made him feel that she had a bond on him for life
that was the way it worked out in practice
psychologically it meant that he could not have a mistress without falling violently in love with her
he was a serious personand in this particular case it was very expensive
the mistress of the grand dukea spanish dancer of passionate appearancesingled out edward for her glances at a ball that was held in their common hotel
edward was tall handsome blond and very wealthy as she understoodand leonora went up to bed early
she did not care for public dances but she was relieved to see that edward appeared to be having a good time with several amiable girls
and that was the end of edwardfor the spanish dancer of passionate appearance wanted one night of him for his beaux yeux
he took her into the dark gardens and remembering suddenly the girl of the kilsyte case he kissed her
he kissed her passionately violently with a sudden explosion of the passion that had been bridled all his lifefor leonora was cold or at any rate well behaved
la dolciquita liked this reversion and he passed the night in her bed
when the palpitating creature was at last asleep in his arms he discovered that he was madly was passionately was overwhelmingly in love with her
it was a passion that had arisen like fire in dry corn
he could think of nothing else he could live for nothing else
but la dolciquita was a reasonable creature without an ounce of passion in her
she wanted a certain satisfaction of her appetites and edward had appealed to her the night before
now that was done with and quite coldly she said that she wanted money if he was to have any more of her
it was a perfectly reasonable commercial transaction
she did not care two buttons for edward or for any man and he was asking her to risk a very good situation with the grand duke
if edward could put up sufficient money to serve as a kind of insurance against accident she was ready to like edward for a time that would be covered as it were by the policy
she was getting fifty thousand dollars a year from her grand duke edward would have to pay a premium of two years' hire for a month of her society
there would not be much risk of the grand duke's finding it out and it was not certain that he would give her the keys of the street if he did find out
but there was the riska twenty per cent risk as she figured it out
she talked to edward as if she had been a solicitor with an estate to sellperfectly quietly and perfectly coldly without any inflections in her voice
she did not want to be unkind to him but she could see no reason for being kind to him
she was a virtuous business woman with a mother and two sisters and her own old age to be provided comfortably for
she did not expect more than a five years' further run
she was twentyfour and as she said we spanish women are horrors at thirty
edward swore that he would provide for her for life if she would come to him and leave off talking so horribly but she only shrugged one shoulder slowly and contemptuously
he tried to convince this woman who as he saw it had surrendered to him her virtue that he regarded it as in any case his duty to provide for her and to cherish her and even to love herfor life
in return for her sacrifice he would do that
in return again for his honourable love she would listen for ever to the accounts of his estate
that was how he figured it out
she shrugged the same shoulder with the same gesture and held out her left hand with the elbow at her side  enfin mon ami she said put in this hand the price of that tiara at forli's or and she turned her back on him
edward went mad his world stood on its head the palms in front of the blue sea danced grotesque dances
you see he believed in the virtue tenderness and moral support of women
he wanted more than anything to argue with la dolciquita to retire with her to an island and point out to her the damnation of her point of view and how salvation can only be found in true love and the feudal system
she had once been his mistress he reflected and by all the moral laws she ought to have gone on being his mistress or at the very least his sympathetic confidante
but her rooms were closed to him she did not appear in the hotel
nothing blank silence
to break that down he had to have twenty thousand pounds
you have heard what happened
he spent a week of madness he hungered his eyes sank in he shuddered at leonora's touch
i dare say that ninetenths of what he took to be his passion for la dolciquita was really discomfort at the thought that he had been unfaithful to leonora
he felt uncommonly bad that is to sayoh unbearably bad and he took it all to be love
poor devil he was incredibly nave
he drank like a fish after leonora was in bed and he spread himself over the tables and this went on for about a fortnight
heaven knows what would have happened he would have thrown away every penny that he possessed
on the night after he had lost about forty thousand pounds and whilst the whole hotel was whispering about it la dolciquita walked composedly into his bedroom
he was too drunk to recognize her and she sat in his armchair knitting and holding smelling salts to her nosefor he was pretty far gone with alcoholic poisoningand as soon as he was able to understand her she said  look here mon ami do not go to the tables again
take a good sleep now and come and see me this afternoon
he slept till the lunchhour
by that time leonora had heard the news
a mrs colonel whelan had told her
mrs colonel whelan seems to have been the only sensible person who was ever connected with the ashburnhams
she had argued it out that there must be a woman of the harpy variety connected with edward's incredible behaviour and mien and she advised leonora to go straight off to townwhich might have the effect of bringing edward to his sensesand to consult her solicitor and her spiritual adviser
she had better go that very morning it was no good arguing with a man in edward's condition
edward indeed did not know that she had gone
as soon as he awoke he went straight to la dolciquita's room and she stood him his lunch in her own apartments
he fell on her neck and wept and she put up with it for a time
she was quite a goodnatured woman
and when she had calmed him down with eau de mlisse she said look here my friend how much money have you left
five thousand dollars
ten
for the rumour went that edward had lost two kings' ransoms a night for fourteen nights and she imagined that he must be near the end of his resources
the eau de mlisse had calmed edward to such an extent that for the moment he really had a head on his shoulders
he did nothing more than grunt  and then
why she answered i may just as well have the ten thousand dollars as the tables
i will go with you to antibes for a week for that sum
edward grunted five
she tried to get seven thousand five hundred but he stuck to his five thousand and the hotel expenses at antibes
the sedative carried him just as far as that and then he collapsed again
he had to leave for antibes at three he could not do without it
he left a note for leonora saying that he had gone off for a week with the clinton morleys yachting
he did not enjoy himself very much at antibes
la dolciquita could talk of nothing with any enthusiasm except money and she tired him unceasingly during every waking hour for presents of the most expensive description
and at the end of a week she just quietly kicked him out
he hung about in antibes for three days
he was cured of the idea that he had any duties towards la dolciquitafeudal or otherwise
but his sentimentalism required of him an attitude of byronic gloomas if his court had gone into halfmourning
then his appetite suddenly returned and he remembered leonora
he found at his hotel at monte carlo a telegram from leonora dispatched from london saying please return as soon as convenient
he could not understand why leonora should have abandoned him so precipitately when she only thought that he had gone yachting with the clinton morleys
then he discovered that she had left the hotel before he had written the note
he had a pretty rocky journey back to town he was frightened out of his lifeand leonora had never seemed so desirable to him
v  i call this the saddest story rather than the ashburnham tragedy just because it is so sad just because there was no current to draw things along to a swift and inevitable end
there is about it none of the elevation that accompanies tragedy there is about it no nemesis no destiny
here were two noble peoplefor i am convinced that both edward and leonora had noble natureshere then were two noble natures drifting down life like fireships afloat on a lagoon and causing miseries heartaches agony of the mind and death
and they themselves steadily deteriorated
and why
for what purpose
to point what lesson
it is all a darkness
there is not even any villain in the storyfor even major basil the husband of the lady who next and really comforted the unfortunate edwardeven major basil was not a villain in this piece
he was a slack loose shiftless sort of fellowbut he did not do anything to edward
whilst they were in the same station in burma he borrowed a good deal of moneythough really since major basil had no particular vices it was difficult to know why he wanted it
he collecteddifferent types of horses' bits from the earliest times to the present daybut since he did not prosecute even this occupation with any vigour he cannot have needed much money for the acquirement say of the bit of genghis khan's chargerif genghis khan had a charger
and when i say that he borrowed a good deal of money from edward i do not mean to say that he had more than a thousand pounds from him during the five years that the connection lasted
edward of course did not have a great deal of money leonora was seeing to that
still he may have had five hundred pounds a year english for his menus plaisirsfor his regimental subscriptions and for keeping his men smart
leonora hated that she would have preferred to buy dresses for herself or to have devoted the money to paying off a mortgage
still with her sense of justice she saw that since she was managing a property bringing in three thousand a year with a view to reestablishing it as a property of five thousand a year and since the property really if not legally belonged to edward it was reasonable and just that edward should get a slice of his own
of course she had the devil of a job
i don't know that i have got the financial details exactly right
i am a pretty good head at figures but my mind still sometimes mixes up pounds with dollars and i get a figure wrong
anyhow the proposition was something like this properly worked and without rebates to the tenants and keeping up schools and things the branshaw estate should have brought in about five thousand a year when edward had it
it brought in actually about four
i am talking in pounds not dollars
edward's excesses with the spanish lady had reduced its value to about threeas the maximum figure without reductions
leonora wanted to get it back to five
she was of course very young to be faced with such a propositiontwentyfour is not a very advanced age
so she did things with a youthful vigour that she would very likely have made more merciful if she had known more about life
she got edward remarkably on the hop
he had to face her in a london hotel when he crept back from monte carlo with his poor tail between his poor legs
as far as i can make out she cut short his first mumblings and his first attempts at affectionate speech with words something like we're on the verge of ruin
do you intend to let me pull things together
if not i shall retire to hendon on my jointure
hendon represented a convent to which she occasionally went for what is called a retreat in catholic circles
and poor dear edward knew nothingabsolutely nothing
he did not know how much money he had as he put it blued at the tables
it might have been a quarter of a million for all he remembered
he did not know whether she knew about la dolciquita or whether she imagined that he had gone off yachting or had stayed at monte carlo
he was just dumb and he just wanted to get into a hole and not have to talk
leonora did not make him talk and she said nothing herself
i do not know much about english legal procedurei cannot i mean give technical details of how they tied him up
but i know that two days later without her having said more than i have reported to you leonora and her attorney had become the trustees as i believe it is called of all edward's property and there was an end of edward as the good landlord and father of his people
he went out
leonora then had three thousand a year at her disposal
she occupied edward with getting himself transferred to a part of his regiment that was in burmaif that is the right way to put it
she herself had an interview lasting a week or sowith edward's landsteward
she made him understand that the estate would have to yield up to its last penny
before they left for india she had let branshaw for seven years at a thousand a year
she sold two vandykes and a little silver for eleven thousand pounds and she raised on mortgage twentynine thousand
that went to edward's moneylending friends in monte carlo
so she had to get the twentynine thousand back for she did not regard the vandykes and the silver as things she would have to replace
they were just frills to the ashburnham vanity
edward cried for two days over the disappearance of his ancestors and then she wished she had not done it but it did not teach her anything and it lessened such esteem as she had for him
she did not also understand that to let branshaw affected him with a feeling of physical soilingthat it was almost as bad for him as if a woman belonging to him had become a prostitute
that was how it did affect him but i dare say she felt just as bad about the spanish dancer
so she went at it
they were eight years in india and during the whole of that time she insisted that they must be selfsupportingthey had to live on his captain's pay plus the extra allowance for being at the front
she gave him the five hundred a year for ashburnham frills as she called it to herselfand she considered she was doing him very well
indeed in a way she did him very wellbut it was not his way
she was always buying him expensive things which as it were she took off her own back
i have for instance spoken of edward's leather cases
well they were not edward's at all they were leonora's manifestations
he liked to be clean but he preferred as it were to be threadbare
she never understood that and all that pigskin was her idea of a reward to him for putting her up to a little speculation by which she made eleven hundred pounds
she did herself the threadbare business
when they went up to a place called simla where as i understand it is cool in the summer and very socialwhen they went up to simla for their healths it was she who had him prancing around as we should say in the united states on a thousanddollar horse with the gladdest of glad rags all over him
she herself used to go into retreat
i believe that was very good for her health and it was also very inexpensive
it was probably also very good for edward's health because he pranced about mostly with mrs basil who was a nice woman and very very kind to him
i suppose she was his mistress but i never heard it from edward of course
i seem to gather that they carried it on in a high romantic fashion very proper to both of themor at any rate for edward she seems to have been a tender and gentle soul who did what he wanted
i do not mean to say that she was without character that was her job to do what edward wanted
so i figured it out that for those five years edward wanted long passages of deep affection kept up in long long talks and that every now and then they fell which would give edward an opportunity for remorse and an excuse to lend the major another fifty
i don't think that mrs basil considered it to be falling she just pitied him and loved him
you see leonora and edward had to talk about something during all these years
you cannot be absolutely dumb when you live with a person unless you are an inhabitant of the north of england or the state of maine
so leonora imagined the cheerful device of letting him see the accounts of his estate and discussing them with him
he did not discuss them much he was trying to behave prettily
but it was old mr mumfordthe farmer who did not pay his rentthat threw edward into mrs basil's arms
mrs basil came upon edward in the dusk in the burmese garden with all sorts of flowers and things
and he was cutting up that cropwith his sword not a walkingstick
he was also carrying on and cursing in a way you would not believe
she ascertained that an old gentleman called mumford had been ejected from his farm and had been given a little cottage rentfree where he lived on ten shillings a week from a farmers' benevolent society supplemented by seven that was being allowed him by the ashburnham trustees
edward had just discovered that fact from the estate accounts
leonora had left them in his dressingroom and he had begun to read them before taking off his marchingkit
that was how he came to have a sword
leonora considered that she had been unusually generous to old mr mumford in allowing him to inhabit a cottage rentfree and in giving him seven shillings a week
anyhow mrs basil had never seen a man in such a state as edward was
she had been passionately in love with him for quite a time and he had been longing for her sympathy and admiration with a passion as deep
that was how they came to speak about it in the burmese garden under the pale sky with sheaves of severed vegetation misty and odorous in the night around their feet
i think they behaved themselves with decorum for quite a time after that though mrs basil spent so many hours over the accounts of the ashburnham estate that she got the name of every field by heart
edward had a huge map of his lands in his harnessroom and major basil did not seem to mind
i believe that people do not mind much in lonely stations
it might have lasted for ever if the major had not been made what is called a brevetcolonel during the shuffling of troops that went on just before the south african war
he was sent off somewhere else and of course mrs basil could not stay with edward
edward ought i suppose to have gone to the transvaal
it would have done him a great deal of good to get killed
but leonora would not let him she had heard awful stories of the extravagance of the hussar regiment in wartimehow they left hundredbottle cases of champagne at five guineas a bottle on the veldt and so on
besides she preferred to see how edward was spending his five hundred a year
i don't mean to say that edward had any grievance in that
he was never a man of the deeds of heroism sort and it was just as good for him to be sniped at up in the hills of the north western frontier as to be shot at by an old gentleman in a tophat at the bottom of some spruit
those are more or less his words about it
i believe he quite distinguished himself over there
at any rate he had had his dso
and was made a brevetmajor
leonora however was not in the least keen on his soldiering
she hated also his deeds of heroism
one of their bitterest quarrels came after he had for the second time in the red sea jumped overboard from the troopship and rescued a private soldier
she stood it the first time and even complimented him
but the red sea was awful that trip and the private soldiers seemed to develop a suicidal craze
it got on leonora's nerves she figured edward for the rest of that trip jumping overboard every ten minutes
and the mere cry of man overboard is a disagreeable alarming and disturbing thing
the ship gets stopped and there are all sorts of shouts
and edward would not promise not to do it again though fortunately they struck a streak of cooler weather when they were in the persian gulf
leonora had got it into her head that edward was trying to commit suicide so i guess it was pretty awful for her when he would not give the promise
leonora ought never to have been on that troopship but she got there somehow as an economy
major basil discovered his wife's relation with edward just before he was sent to his other station
i don't know whether that was a blackmailer's adroitness or just a trick of destiny
he may have known of it all the time or he may not
at any rate he got hold of just about then some letters and things
it cost edward three hundred pounds immediately
i do not know how it was arranged i cannot imagine how even a blackmailer can make his demands
i suppose there is some sort of way of saving your face
i figure the major as disclosing the letters to edward with furious oaths then accepting his explanations that the letters were perfectly innocent if the wrong construction were not put upon them
then the major would say i say old chap i'm deuced hard up
couldn't you lend me three hundred or so
i fancy that was how it was
and year by year after that there would come a letter from the major saying that he was deuced hard up and couldn't edward lend him three hundred or so
edward was pretty hard hit when mrs basil had to go away
he really had been very fond of her and he remained faithful to her memory for quite a long time
and mrs basil had loved him very much and continued to cherish a hope of reunion with him
three days ago there came a quite proper but very lamentable letter from her to leonora asking to be given particulars as to edward's death
she had read the advertisement of it in an indian paper
i think she must have been a very nice woman  and then the ashburnhams were moved somewhere up towards a place or a district called chitral
i am no good at geography of the indian empire
by that time they had settled down into a model couple and they never spoke in private to each other
leonora had given up even showing the accounts of the ashburnham estate to edward
he thought that that was because she had piled up such a lot of money that she did not want him to know how she was getting on any more
but as a matter of fact after five or six years it had penetrated to her mind that it was painful to edward to have to look on at the accounts of his estate and have no hand in the management of it
she was trying to do him a kindness
and up in chitral poor dear little maisie maidan came along  that was the most unsettling to edward of all his affairs
it made him suspect that he was inconstant
the affair with the dolciquita he had sized up as a short attack of madness like hydrophobia
his relations with mrs basil had not seemed to him to imply moral turpitude of a gross kind
the husband had been complaisant they had really loved each other his wife was very cruel to him and had long ceased to be a wife to him
he thought that mrs basil had been his soulmate separated from him by an unkind fatesomething sentimental of that sort
but he discovered that whilst he was still writing long weekly letters to mrs basil he was beginning to be furiously impatient if he missed seeing maisie maidan during the course of the day
he discovered himself watching the doorways with impatience he discovered that he disliked her boy husband very much for hours at a time
he discovered that he was getting up at unearthly hours in order to have time later in the morning to go for a walk with maisie maidan
he discovered himself using little slang words that she used and attaching a sentimental value to those words
these you understand were discoveries that came so late that he could do nothing but drift
he was losing weight his eyes were beginning to fall in he had touches of bad fever
he was as he described it pipped
and one ghastly hot day he suddenly heard himself say to leonora  i say couldn't we take mrs maidan with us to europe and drop her at nauheim
he hadn't had the least idea of saying that to leonora
he had merely been standing looking at an illustrated paper waiting for dinner
dinner was twenty minutes late or the ashburnhams would not have been alone together
no he hadn't had the least idea of framing that speech
he had just been standing in a silent agony of fear of longing of heat of fever
he was thinking that they were going back to branshaw in a month and that maisie maidan was going to remain behind and die
and then that had come out
the punkah swished in the darkened room leonora lay exhausted and motionless in her cane lounge neither of them stirred
they were both at that time very ill in indefinite ways
and then leonora said  yes
i promised it to charlie maidan this afternoon
i have offered to pay her ex's myself
edward just saved himself from saying good god
you see he had not the least idea of what leonora knewabout maisie about mrs basil even about la dolciquita
it was a pretty enigmatic situation for him
it struck him that leonora must be intending to manage his loves as she managed his money affairs and it made her more hateful to himand more worthy of respect
leonora at any rate had managed his money to some purpose
she had spoken to him a week before for the first time in several yearsabout money
she had made twentytwo thousand pounds out of the branshaw land and seven by the letting of branshaw furnished
by fortunate investmentsin which edward had helped hershe had made another six or seven thousand that might well become more
the mortgages were all paid off so that except for the departure of the two vandykes and the silver they were as well off as they had been before the dolciquita had acted the locust
it was leonora's great achievement
she laid the figures before edward who maintained an unbroken silence
i propose she said that you should resign from the army and that we should go back to branshaw
we are both too ill to stay here any longer
edward said nothing at all
this leonora continued passionlessly is the great day of my life
edward said  you have managed the job amazingly
you are a wonderful woman
he was thinking that if they went back to branshaw they would leave maisie maidan behind
that thought occupied him exclusively
they must undoubtedly return to branshaw there could be no doubt that leonora was too ill to stay in that place
she said  you understand that the management of the whole of the expenditure of the income will be in your hands
there will be five thousand a year
she thought that he cared very much about the expenditure of an income of five thousand a year and that the fact that she had done so much for him would rouse in him some affection for her
but he was thinking exclusively of maisie maidanof maisie thousands of miles away from him
he was seeing the mountains between themblue mountains and the sea and sunlit plains
he said  that is very generous of you
and she did not know whether that were praise or a sneer
that had been a week before
and all that week he had passed in an increasing agony at the thought that those mountains that sea and those sunlit plains would be between him and maisie maidan
that thought shook him in the burning nights the sweat poured from him and he trembled with cold in the burning noonsat that thought
he had no minute's rest his bowels turned round and round within him his tongue was perpetually dry and it seemed to him that the breath between his teeth was like air from a pesthouse
he gave no thought to leonora at all he had sent in his papers
they were to leave in a month
it seemed to him to be his duty to leave that place and to go away to support leonora
he did his duty
it was horrible in their relationship at that time that whatever she did caused him to hate her
he hated her when he found that she proposed to set him up as the lord of branshaw againas a sort of dummy lord in swaddling clothes
he imagined that she had done this in order to separate him from maisie maidan
hatred hung in all the heavy nights and filled the shadowy corners of the room
so when he heard that she had offered to the maidan boy to take his wife to europe with him automatically he hated her since he hated all that she did
it seemed to him at that time that she could never be other than cruel even if by accident an act of hers were kind
yes it was a horrible situation
but the cool breezes of the ocean seemed to clear up that hatred as if it had been a curtain
they seemed to give him back admiration for her and respect
the agreeableness of having money lavishly at command the fact that it had bought for him the companionship of maisie maidanthese things began to make him see that his wife might have been right in the starving and scraping upon which she had insisted
he was at ease he was even radiantly happy when he carried cups of bouillon for maisie maidan along the deck
one night when he was leaning beside leonora over the ship's side he said suddenly  by jove you're the finest woman in the world
i wish we could be better friends
she just turned away without a word and went to her cabin
still she was very much better in health
and now i suppose i must give you leonora's side of the case  that is very difficult
for leonora if she preserved an unchanged front changed very frequently her point of view
she had been drilledin her tradition in her upbringingto keep her mouth shut
but there were times she said when she was so near yielding to the temptation of speaking that afterwards she shuddered to think of those times
you must postulate that what she desired above all things was to keep a shut mouth to the world to edward and to the women that he loved
if she spoke she would despise herself
from the moment of his unfaithfulness with la dolciquita she never acted the part of wife to edward
it was not that she intended to keep herself from him as a principle for ever
her spiritual advisers i believe forbade that
but she stipulated that he must in some way perhaps symbolical come back to her
she was not very clear as to what she meant probably she did not know herself
or perhaps she did
there were moments when he seemed to be coming back to her there were moments when she was within a hair of yielding to her physical passion for him
in just the same way at moments she almost yielded to the temptation to denounce mrs basil to her husband or maisie maidan to hers
she desired then to cause the horrors and pains of public scandals
for watching edward more intently and with more straining of ears than that which a cat bestows upon a bird overhead she was aware of the progress of his passion for each of these ladies
she was aware of it from the way in which his eyes returned to doors and gateways she knew from his tranquillities when he had received satisfactions
at times she imagined herself to see more than was warranted
she imagined that edward was carrying on intrigues with other womenwith two at once with three
for whole periods she imagined him to be a monster of libertinage and she could not see that he could have anything against her
she left him his liberty she was starving herself to build up his fortunes she allowed herself none of the joys of femininityno dresses no jewelshardly even friendships for fear they should cost money
and yet oddly she could not but be aware that both mrs basil and maisie maidan were nice women
the curious discounting eye which one woman can turn on another did not prevent her seeing that mrs basil was very good to edward and mrs maidan very good for him
that seemed her to be a monstrous and incomprehensible working of fate's
incomprehensible
why she asked herself again and again did none of the good deeds that she did for her husband ever come through to him or appear to him as good deeds
by what trick of mania could not he let her be as good to him as mrs basil was
mrs basil was not so extraordinarily dissimilar to herself
she was it was true tall dark with soft mournful voice and a great kindness of manner for every created thing from punkah men to flowers on the trees
but she was not so well read as leonora at any rate in learned books
leonora could not stand novels
but even with all her differences mrs basil did not appear to leonora to differ so very much from herself
she was truthful honest and for the rest just a woman
and leonora had a vague sort of idea that to a man all women are the same after three weeks of close intercourse
she thought that the kindness should no longer appeal the soft and mournful voice no longer thrill the tall darkness no longer give a man the illusion that he was going into the depths of an unexplored wood
she could not understand how edward could go on and on maundering over mrs basil
she could not see why he should continue to write her long letters after their separation
after that indeed she had a very bad time
she had at that period what i will call the monstrous theory of edward
she was always imagining him ogling at every woman that he came across
she did not that year go into retreat at simla because she was afraid that he would corrupt her maid in her absence
she imagined him carrying on intrigues with native women or eurasians
at dances she was in a fever of watchfulness
she persuaded herself that this was because she had a dread of scandals
edward might get himself mixed up with a marriageable daughter of some man who would make a row or some husband who would matter
but really she acknowledged afterwards to herself she was hoping that mrs basil being out of the way the time might have come when edward should return to her
all that period she passed in an agony of jealousy and fearthe fear that edward might really become promiscuous in his habits
so that in an odd way she was glad when maisie maidan came alongand she realized that she had not before been afraid of husbands and of scandals since then she did her best to keep maisie's husband unsuspicious
she wished to appear so trustful of edward that maidan could not possibly have any suspicions
it was an evil position for her
but edward was very ill and she wanted to see him smile again
she thought that if he could smile again through her agency he might return through gratitude and satisfied loveto her
at that time she thought that edward was a person of light and fleeting passions
and she could understand edward's passion for maisie since maisie was one of those women to whom other women will allow magnetism
she was very pretty she was very young in spite of her heart she was very gay and light on her feet
and leonora was really very fond of maisie who was fond enough of leonora
leonora indeed imagined that she could manage this affair all right
she had no thought of maisie's being led into adultery she imagined that if she could take maisie and edward to nauheim edward would see enough of her to get tired of her pretty little chatterings and of the pretty little motions of her hands and feet
and she thought she could trust edward
for there was not any doubt of maisie's passion for edward
she raved about him to leonora as leonora had heard girls rave about drawing masters in schools
she was perpetually asking her boy husband why he could not dress ride shoot play polo or even recite sentimental poems like their major
and young maidan had the greatest admiration for edward and he adored was bewildered by and entirely trusted his wife
it appeared to him that edward was devoted to leonora
and leonora imagined that when poor maisie was cured of her heart and edward had seen enough of her he would return to her
she had the vague passionate idea that when edward had exhausted a number of other types of women he must turn to her
why should not her type have its turn in his heart
she imagined that by now she understood him better that she understood better his vanities and that by making him happier she could arouse his love
florence knocked all that on the head     part iv  i  i have i am aware told this story in a very rambling way so that it may be difficult for anyone to find their path through what may be a sort of maze
i cannot help it
i have stuck to my idea of being in a country cottage with a silent listener hearing between the gusts of the wind and amidst the noises of the distant sea the story as it comes
and when one discusses an affaira long sad affairone goes back one goes forward
one remembers points that one has forgotten and one explains them all the more minutely since one recognizes that one has forgotten to mention them in their proper places and that one may have given by omitting them a false impression
i console myself with thinking that this is a real story and that after all real stories are probably told best in the way a person telling a story would tell them
they will then seem most real
at any rate i think i have brought my story up to the date of maisie maidan's death
i mean that i have explained everything that went before it from the several points of view that were necessaryfrom leonora's from edward's and to some extent from my own
you have the facts for the trouble of finding them you have the points of view as far as i could ascertain or put them
let me imagine myself back then at the day of maisie's deathor rather at the moment of florence's dissertation on the protest up in the old castle of the town of m
let us consider leonora's point of view with regard to florence edward's of course i cannot give you for edward naturally never spoke of his affair with my wife
i may in what follows be a little hard on florence but you must remember that i have been writing away at this story now for six months and reflecting longer and longer upon these affairs
and the longer i think about them the more certain i become that florence was a contaminating influenceshe depressed and deteriorated poor edward she deteriorated hopelessly the miserable leonora
there is no doubt that she caused leonora's character to deteriorate
if there was a fine point about leonora it was that she was proud and that she was silent
but that pride and that silence broke when she made that extraordinary outburst in the shadowy room that contained the protest and in the little terrace looking over the river
i don't mean to say that she was doing a wrong thing
she was certainly doing right in trying to warn me that florence was making eyes at her husband
but if she did the right thing she was doing it in the wrong way
perhaps she should have reflected longer she should have spoken if she wanted to speak only after reflection
or it would have been better if she had actedif for instance she had so chaperoned florence that private communication between her and edward became impossible
she should have gone eavesdropping she should have watched outside bedroom doors
it is odious but that is the way the job is done
she should have taken edward away the moment maisie was dead
no she acted wrongly and yet poor thing is it for me to condemn herand what did it matter in the end
if it had not been florence it would have been some other
still it might have been a better woman than my wife
for florence was vulgar florence was a common flirt who would not at the last lacher prise and florence was an unstoppable talker
you could not stop her nothing would stop her
edward and leonora were at least proud and reserved people
pride and reserve are not the only things in life perhaps they are not even the best things
but if they happen to be your particular virtues you will go all to pieces if you let them go
and leonora let them go
she let them go before poor edward did even
consider her position when she burst out over the lutherprotest
consider her agonies  you are to remember that the main passion of her life was to get edward back she had never till that moment despaired of getting him back
that may seem ignoble but you have also to remember that her getting him back represented to her not only a victory for herself
it would as it appeared to her have been a victory for all wives and a victory for her church
that was how it presented itself to her
these things are a little inscrutable
i don't know why the getting back of edward should have represented to her a victory for all wives for society and for her church
or maybe i have a glimmering of it
she saw life as a perpetual sexbattle between husbands who desire to be unfaithful to their wives and wives who desire to recapture their husbands in the end
that was her sad and modest view of matrimony
man for her was a sort of brute who must have his divagations his moments of excess his nights out his let us say rutting seasons
she had read few novels so that the idea of a pure and constant love succeeding the sound of wedding bells had never been very much presented to her
she went numbed and terrified to the mother superior of her childhood's convent with the tale of edward's infidelities with the spanish dancer and all that the old nun who appeared to her to be infinitely wise mystic and reverend had done had been to shake her head sadly and to say  men are like that
by the blessing of god it will all come right in the end
that was what was put before her by her spiritual advisers as her programme in life
or at any rate that was how their teachings came through to herthat was the lesson she told me she had learned of them
i don't know exactly what they taught her
the lot of women was patience and patience and again patiencead majorem dei gloriamuntil upon the appointed day if god saw fit she should have her reward
if then in the end she should have succeeded in getting edward back she would have kept her man within the limits that are all that wifehood has to expect
she was even taught that such excesses in men are natural excusableas if they had been children
and the great thing was that there should be no scandal before the congregation
so she had clung to the idea of getting edward back with a fierce passion that was like an agony
she had looked the other way she had occupied herself solely with one idea
that was the idea of having edward appear when she did get him back wealthy glorious as it were on account of his lands and upright
she would show in fact that in an unfaithful world one catholic woman had succeeded in retaining the fidelity of her husband
and she thought she had come near her desires
her plan with regard to maisie had appeared to be working admirably
edward had seemed to be cooling off towards the girl
he did not hunger to pass every minute of the time at nauheirn beside the child's recumbent form he went out to polo matches he played auction bridge in the evenings he was cheerful and bright
she was certain that he was not trying to seduce that poor child she was beginning to think that he had never tried to do so
he seemed in fact to be dropping back into what he had been for maisie in the beginninga kind attentive superior officer in the regiment paying gallant attentions to a bride
they were as open in their little flirtations as the dayspring from on high
and maisie had not appeared to fret when he went off on excursions with us she had to lie down for so many hours on her bed every afternoon and she had not appeared to crave for the attentions of edward at those times
and edward was beginning to make little advances to leonora
once or twice in privatefor he often did it before peoplehe had said how nice you look
or what a pretty dress
she had gone with florence to frankfurt where they dress as well as in paris and had got herself a gown or two
she could afford it and florence was an excellent adviser as to dress
she seemed to have got hold of the clue to the riddle
yes leonora seemed to have got hold of the clue to the riddle
she imagined herself to have been in the wrong to some extent in the past
she should not have kept edward on such a tight rein with regard to money
she thought she was on the right tack in letting himas she had done only with fear and irresolutionhave again the control of his income
he came even a step towards her and acknowledged spontaneously that she had been right in husbanding for all those years their resources
he said to her one day  you've done right old girl
there's nothing i like so much as to have a little to chuck away
and i can do it thanks to you
that was really she said the happiest moment of her life
and he seeming to realize it had ventured to pat her on the shoulder
he had ostensibly come in to borrow a safetypin of her
and the occasion of her boxing maisie's ears had after it was over riveted in her mind the idea that there was no intrigue between edward and mrs maidan
she imagined that from henceforward all that she had to do was to keep him well supplied with money and his mind amused with pretty girls
she was convinced that he was coming back to her
for that month she no longer repelled his timid advances that never went very far
for he certainly made timid advances
he patted her on the shoulder he whispered into her ear little jokes about the odd figures that they saw up at the casino
it was not much to make a little jokebut the whispering of it was a precious intimacy  and thensmashit all went
it went to pieces at the moment when florence laid her hand upon edward's wrist as it lay on the glass sheltering the manuscript of the protest up in the high tower with the shutters where the sunlight here and there streamed in
or rather it went when she noticed the look in edward's eyes as he gazed back into florence's
she knew that look
she had knownsince the first moment of their meeting since the moment of our all sitting down to dinner togetherthat florence was making eyes at edward
but she had seen so many women make eyes at edwardhundreds and hundreds of women in railway trains in hotels aboard liners at street corners
and she had arrived at thinking that edward took little stock in women that made eyes at him
she had formed what was at that time a fairly correct estimate of the methods of the reasons for edward's loves
she was certain that hitherto they had consisted of the short passion for the dolciquita the real sort of love for mrs basil and what she deemed the pretty courtship of maisie maidan
besides she despised florence so haughtily that she could not imagine edward's being attracted by her
and she and maisie were a sort of bulwark round him
she wanted besides to keep her eyes on florencefor florence knew that she had boxed maisie's ears
and leonora desperately desired that her union with edward should appear to be flawless
but all that went  with the answering gaze of edward into florence's blue and uplifted eyes she knew that it had all gone
she knew that that gaze meant that those two had had long conversations of an intimate kindabout their likes and dislikes about their natures about their views of marriage
she knew what it meant that she when we all four walked out together had always been with me ten yards ahead of florence and edward
she did not imagine that it had gone further than talks about their likes and dislikes about their natures or about marriage as an institution
but having watched edward all her life she knew that that laying on of hands that answering of gaze with gaze meant that the thing was unavoidable
edward was such a serious person
she knew that any attempt on her part to separate those two would be to rivet on edward an irrevocable passion that as i have before told you it was a trick of edward's nature to believe that the seducing of a woman gave her an irrevocable hold over him for life
and that touching of hands she knew would give that woman an irrevocable claimto be seduced
and she so despised florence that she would have preferred it to be a parlourmaid
there are very decent parlourmaids
and suddenly there came into her mind the conviction that maisie maidan had a real passion for edward that this would break her heartand that she leonora would be responsible for that
she went for the moment mad
she clutched me by the wrist she dragged me down those stairs and across that whispering rittersaal with the high painted pillars the high painted chimneypiece
i guess she did not go mad enough
she ought to have said  your wife is a harlot who is going to be my husband's mistress  that might have done the trick
but even in her madness she was afraid to go as far as that
she was afraid that if she did edward and florence would make a bolt of it and that if they did that she would lose forever all chance of getting him back in the end
she acted very badly to me
well she was a tortured soul who put her church before the interests of a philadelphia quaker
that is all righti daresay the church of rome is the more important of the two
a week after maisie maidan's death she was aware that florence had become edward's mistress
she waited outside florence's door and met edward as he came away
she said nothing and he only grunted
but i guess he had a bad time
yes the mental deterioration that florence worked in leonora was extraordinary it smashed up her whole life and all her chances
it made her in the first place hopelessfor she could not see how after that edward could return to herafter a vulgar intrigue with a vulgar woman
his affair with mrs basil which was now all that she had to bring in her heart against him she could not find it in her to call an intrigue
it was a love affaira pure enough thing in its way
but this seemed to her to be a horrora wantonness all the more detestable to her because she so detested florence
and florence talked  that was what was terrible because florence forced leonora herself to abandon her high reserveflorence and the situation
it appears that florence was in two minds whether to confess to me or to leonora
confess she had to
and she pitched at last on leonora because if it had been me she would have had to confess a great deal more
or at least i might have guessed a great deal more about her heart and about jimmy
so she went to leonora one day and began hinting and hinting
and she enraged leonora to such an extent that at last leonora said  you want to tell me that you are edward's mistress
you can be
i have no use for him
that was really a calamity for leonora because once started there was no stopping the talking
she tried to stopbut it was not to be done
she found it necessary to send edward messages through florence for she would not speak to him
she had to give him for instance to understand that if i ever came to know of his intrigue she would ruin him beyond repair
and it complicated matters a good deal that edward at about this time was really a little in love with her
he thought that he had treated her so badly that she was so fine
she was so mournful that he longed to comfort her and he thought himself such a blackguard that there was nothing he would not have done to make amends
and florence communicated these items of information to leonora
i don't in the least blame leonora for her coarseness to florence it must have done florence a world of good
but i do blame her for giving way to what was in the end a desire for communicativeness
you see that business cut her off from her church
she did not want to confess what she was doing because she was afraid that her spiritual advisers would blame her for deceiving me
i rather imagine that she would have preferred damnation to breaking my heart
that is what it works out at
she need not have troubled
but having no priests to talk to she had to talk to someone and as florence insisted on talking to her she talked back in short explosive sentences like one of the damned
precisely like one of the damned
well if a pretty period in hell on this earth can spare her any period of pain in eternitywhere there are not any periodsi guess leonora will escape hell fire
her conversations with florence would be like this
florence would happen in on her whilst she was doing her wonderful hair with a proposition from edward who seems about that time to have conceived the nave idea that he might become a polygamist
i daresay it was florence who put it into his head
anyhow i am not responsible for the oddities of the human psychology
but it certainly appears that at about that date edward cared more for leonora than he had ever done beforeor at any rate for a long time
and if leonora had been a person to play cards and if she had played her cards well and if she had had no sense of shame and so on she might then have shared edward with florence until the time came for jerking that poor cuckoo out of the nest
well florence would come to leonora with some such proposition
i do not mean to say that she put it baldly like that
she stood out that she was not edward's mistress until leonora said that she had seen edward coming out of her room at an advanced hour of the night
that checked florence a bit but she fell back upon her heart and stuck out that she had merely been conversing with edward in order to bring him to a better frame of mind
florence had of course to stick to that story for even florence would not have had the face to implore leonora to grant her favours to edward if she had admitted that she was edward's mistress
that could not be done
at the same time florence had such a pressing desire to talk about something
there would have been nothing else to talk about but a rapprochement between that estranged pair
so florence would go on babbling and leonora would go on brushing her hair
and then leonora would say suddenly something like  i should think myself defiled if edward touched me now that he has touched you
that would discourage florence a bit but after a week or so on another morning she would have another try
and even in other things leonora deteriorated
she had promised edward to leave the spending of his own income in his own hands
and she had fully meant to do that
i daresay she would have done it too though no doubt she would have spied upon his banking account in secret
she was not a roman catholic for nothing
but she took so serious a view of edward's unfaithfulness to the memory of poor little maisie that she could not trust him any more at all
so when she got back to branshaw she started after less than a month to worry him about the minutest items of his expenditure
she allowed him to draw his own cheques but there was hardly a cheque that she did not scrutinizeexcept for a private account of about five hundred a year which tacitly she allowed him to keep for expenditure on his mistress or mistresses
he had to have his jaunts to paris he had to send expensive cables in cipher to florence about twice a week
but she worried him about his expenditure on wines on fruit trees on harness on gates on the account at his blacksmith's for work done to a new patent army stirrup that he was trying to invent
she could not see why he should bother to invent a new army stirrup and she was really enraged when after the invention was mature he made a present to the war office of the designs and the patent rights
it was a remarkably good stirrup
i have told you i think that edward spent a great deal of time and about two hundred pounds for law fees on getting a poor girl the daughter of one of his gardeners acquitted of a charge of murdering her baby
that was positively the last act of edward's life
it came at a time when nancy rufford was on her way to india when the most horrible gloom was over the household when edward himself was in an agony and behaving as prettily as he knew how
yet even then leonora made him a terrible scene about this expenditure of time and trouble
she sort of had the vague idea that what had passed with the girl and the rest of it ought to have taught edward a lessonthe lesson of economy
she threatened to take his banking account away from him again
i guess that made him cut his throat
he might have stuck it out otherwisebut the thought that he had lost nancy and that in addition there was nothing left for him but a dreary dreary succession of days in which he could be of no public service well it finished him
it was during those years that leonora tried to get up a love affair of her own with a fellow called bayhama decent sort of fellow
a really nice man
but the affair was no sort of success
i have told you about it already   ii  well that about brings me up to the date of my receiving in waterbury the laconic cable from edward to the effect that he wanted me to go to branshaw and have a chat
i was pretty busy at the time and i was half minded to send him a reply cable to the effect that i would start in a fortnight
but i was having a long interview with old mr hurlbird's attorneys and immediately afterwards i had to have a long interview with the misses hurlbird so i delayed cabling
i had expected to find the misses hurlbird excessively oldin the nineties or thereabouts
the time had passed so slowly that i had the impression that it must have been thirty years since i had been in the united states
it was only twelve years
actually miss hurlbird was just sixtyone and miss florence hurlbird fiftynine and they were both mentally and physically as vigorous as could be desired
they were indeed more vigorous mentally than suited my purpose which was to get away from the united states as quickly as i could
the hurlbirds were an exceedingly united familyexceedingly united except on one set of points
each of the three of them had a separate doctor whom they trusted implicitlyand each had a separate attorney
and each of them distrusted the other's doctor and the other's attorney
and naturally the doctors and the attorneys warned one all the timeagainst each other
you cannot imagine how complicated it all became for me
of course i had an attorney of my ownrecommended to me by young carter my philadelphia nephew
i do not mean to say that there was any unpleasantness of a grasping kind
the problem was quite another onea moral dilemma
you see old mr hurlbird had left all his property to florence with the mere request that she would have erected to him in the city of waterbury ill a memorial that should take the form of some sort of institution for the relief of sufferers from the heart
florence's money had all come to meand with it old mr hurlbird's
he had died just five days before florence
well i was quite ready to spend a round million dollars on the relief of sufferers from the heart
the old gentleman had left about a million and a half florence had been worth about eight hundred thousandand as i figured it out i should cut up at about a million myself
anyhow there was ample money
but i naturally wanted to consult the wishes of his surviving relatives and then the trouble really began
you see it had been discovered that mr hurlbird had had nothing whatever the matter with his heart
his lungs had been a little affected all through his life and he had died of bronchitis
it struck miss florence hurlbird that since her brother had died of lungs and not of heart his money ought to go to lung patients
that she considered was what her brother would have wished
on the other hand by a kink that i could not at the time understand miss hurlbird insisted that i ought to keep the money all to myself
she said that she did not wish for any monuments to the hurlbird family
at the time i thought that that was because of a new england dislike for necrological ostentation
but i can figure out now when i remember certain insistent and continued questions that she put to me about edward ashburnham that there was another idea in her mind
and leonora has told me that on florence's dressingtable beside her dead body there had lain a letter to miss hurlbirda letter which leonora posted without telling me
i don't know how florence had time to write to her aunt but i can quite understand that she would not like to go out of the world without making some comments
so i guess florence had told miss hurlbird a good bit about edward ashburnham in a few scrawled wordsand that that was why the old lady did not wish the name of hurlbird perpetuated
perhaps also she thought that i had earned the hurlbird money
it meant a pretty tidy lot of discussing what with the doctors warning each other about the bad effects of discussions on the health of the old ladies and warning me covertly against each other and saying that old mr hurlbird might have died of heart after all in spite of the diagnosis of his doctor
and the solicitors all had separate methods of arranging about how the money should be invested and entrusted and bound
personally i wanted to invest the money so that the interest could be used for the relief of sufferers from the heart
if old mr hurlbird had not died of any defects in that organ he had considered that it was defective
moreover florence had certainly died of her heart as i saw it
and when miss florence hurlbird stood out that the money ought to go to chest sufferers i was brought to thinking that there ought to be a chest institution too and i advanced the sum that i was ready to provide to a million and a half of dollars
that would have given seven hundred and fifty thousand to each class of invalid
i did not want money at all badly
all i wanted it for was to be able to give nancy rufford a good time
i did not know much about housekeeping expenses in england where i presumed she would wish to live
i knew that her needs at that time were limited to good chocolates and a good horse or two and simple pretty frocks
probably she would want more than that later on
but even if i gave a million and a half dollars to these institutions i should still have the equivalent of about twenty thousand a year english and i considered that nancy could have a pretty good time on that or less
anyhow we had a stiff set of arguments up at the hurlbird mansion which stands on a bluff over the town
it may strike you silent listener as being funny if you happen to be european
but moral problems of that description and the giving of millions to institutions are immensely serious matters in my country
indeed they are the staple topics for consideration amongst the wealthy classes
we haven't got peerage and social climbing to occupy us much and decent people do not take interest in politics or elderly people in sport
so that there were real tears shed by both miss hurlbird and miss florence before i left that city
i left it quite abruptly
four hours after edward's telegram came another from leonora saying yes do come
you could be so helpful
i simply told my attorney that there was the million and a half that he could invest it as he liked and that the purposes must be decided by the misses hurlbird
i was anyhow pretty well worn out by all the discussions
and as i have never heard yet from the misses hurlbird i rather think that miss hurlbird either by revelations or by moral force has persuaded miss florence that no memorial to their names shall be erected in the city of waterbury conn miss hurlbird wept dreadfully when she heard that i was going to stay with the ashburnhams but she did not make any comments
i was aware at that date that her niece had been seduced by that fellow jimmy before i had married herbut i contrived to produce on her the impression that i thought florence had been a model wife
why at that date i still believed that florence had been perfectly virtuous after her marriage to me
i had not figured it out that she could have played it so low down as to continue her intrigue with that fellow under my roof
well i was a fool
but i did not think much about florence at that date
my mind was occupied with what was happening at branshaw
i had got it into my head that the telegrams had something to do with nancy
it struck me that she might have shown signs of forming an attachment for some undesirable fellow and that leonora wanted me to come back and marry her out of harm's way
that was what was pretty firmly in my mind
and it remained in my mind for nearly ten days after my arrival at that beautiful old place
neither edward nor leonora made any motion to talk to me about anything other than the weather and the crops
yet although there were several young fellows about i could not see that any one in particular was distinguished by the girl's preference
she certainly appeared illish and nervous except when she woke up to talk gay nonsense to me
oh the pretty thing that she was
i imagined that what must have happened was that the undesirable young man had been forbidden the place and that nancy was fretting a little
what had happened was just hell
leonora had spoken to nancy nancy had spoken to edward edward had spoken to leonoraand they had talked and talked
and talked
you have to imagine horrible pictures of gloom and half lights and emotions running through silent nightsthrough whole nights
you have to imagine my beautiful nancy appearing suddenly to edward rising up at the foot of his bed with her long hair falling like a split cone of shadow in the glimmer of a nightlight that burned beside him
you have to imagine her a silent a no doubt agonized figure like a spectre suddenly offering herself to himto save his reason
and you have to imagine his frantic refusaland talk
and talk
my god
and yet to me living in the house enveloped with the charm of the quiet and ordered living with the silent skilled servants whose mere laying out of my dress clothes was like a caressto me who was hourly with them they appeared like tender ordered and devoted people smiling absenting themselves at the proper intervals driving me to meetsjust good people
how the devilhow the devil do they do it
at dinner one evening leonora saidshe had just opened a telegram  nancy will be going to india tomorrow to be with her father
no one spoke
nancy looked at her plate edward went on eating his pheasant
i felt very bad i imagined that it would be up to me to propose to nancy that evening
it appeared to me to be queer that they had not given me any warning of nancy's departurebut i thought that that was only english mannerssome sort of delicacy that i had not got the hang of
you must remember that at that moment i trusted in edward and leonora and in nancy rufford and in the tranquility of ancient haunts of peace as i had trusted in my mother's love
and that evening edward spoke to me
what in the interval had happened had been this  upon her return from nauheim leonora had completely broken downbecause she knew she could trust edward
that seems odd but if you know anything about breakdowns you will know that by the ingenious torments that fate prepares for us these things come as soon as a strain having relaxed there is nothing more to be done
it is after a husband's long illness and death that a widow goes to pieces it is at the end of a long rowing contest that a crew collapses and lies forward upon its oars
and that was what happened to leonora
from certain tones in edward's voice from the long steady stare that he had given her from his bloodshot eyes on rising from the dinner table in the nauheim hotel she knew that in the affair of the poor girl this was a case in which edward's moral scruples or his social code or his idea that it would be playing it too low down rendered nancy perfectly safe
the girl she felt sure was in no danger at all from edward
and in that she was perfectly right
the smash was to come from herself
she relaxed she broke she drifted at first quickly then with an increasing momentum down the stream of destiny
you may put it that having been cut off from the restraints of her religion for the first time in her life she acted along the lines of her instinctive desires
i do not know whether to think that in that she was no longer herself or that having let loose the bonds of her standards her conventions and her traditions she was being for the first time her own natural self
she was torn between her intense maternal love for the girl and an intense jealousy of the woman who realizes that the man she loves has met what appears to be the final passion of his life
she was divided between an intense disgust for edward's weakness in conceiving this passion an intense pity for the miseries that he was enduring and a feeling equally intense but one that she hid from herselfa feeling of respect for edward's determination to keep himself in this particular affair unspotted
and the human heart is a very mysterious thing
it is impossible to say that leonora in acting as she then did was not filled with a sort of hatred of edward's final virtue
she wanted i think to despise him
he was she realized gone from her for good
then let him suffer let him agonize let him if possible break and go to that hell that is the abode of broken resolves
she might have taken a different line
it would have been so easy to send the girl away to stay with some friends to have taken her away herself upon some pretext or other
that would not have cured things but it would have been the decent line
but at that date poor leonora was incapable of taking any line whatever
she pitied edward frightfully at one timeand then she acted along the lines of pity she loathed him at another and then she acted as her loathing dictated
she gasped as a person dying of tuberculosis gasps for air
she craved madly for communication with some other human soul
and the human soul that she selected was that of the girl
perhaps nancy was the only person that she could have talked to
with her necessity for reticences with her coldness of manner leonora had singularly few intimates
she had none at all with the exception of the mrs colonel whelen who had advised her about the affair with la dolciquita and the one or two religious who had guided her through life
the colonel's wife was at that time in madeira the religious she now avoided
her visitors' book had seven hundred names in it there was not a soul that she could speak to
she was mrs ashburnham of branshaw teleragh
she was the great mrs ashburnham of branshaw and she lay all day upon her bed in her marvellous light airy bedroom with the chintzes and the chippendale and the portraits of deceased ashburnhams by zoffany and zucchero
when there was a meet she would struggle upsupposing it were within driving distanceand let edward drive her and the girl to the crossroads or the country house
she would drive herself back alone edward would ride off with the girl
ride leonora could not that seasonher head was too bad
each pace of her mare was an anguish
but she drove with efficiency and precision she smiled at the gimmers and ffoulkes and the hedley seatons
she threw with exactitude pennies to the boys who opened gates for her she sat upright on the seat of the high dogcart she waved her hands to edward and nancy as they rode off with the hounds and every one could hear her clear high voice in the chilly weather saying have a good time
poor forlorn woman
there was however one spark of consolation
it came from the fact that rodney bayham of bayham followed her always with his eyes
it had been three years since she had tried her abortive loveaffair with him
yet still on the winter mornings he would ride up to her shafts and just say good day and look at her with eyes that were not imploring but seemed to say you see i am still as the germans say a dat disposition
it was a great consolation not because she proposed ever to take him up again but because it showed her that there was in the world one faithful soul in ridingbreeches
and it showed her that she was not losing her looks
and indeed she was not losing her looks
she was forty but she was as clean run as on the day she had left the conventas clear in outline as clear coloured in the hair as dark blue in the eyes
she thought that her lookingglass told her this but there are always the doubts rodney bayham's eyes took them away
it is very singular that leonora should not have aged at all
i suppose that there are some types of beauty and even of youth made for the embellishments that come with enduring sorrow
that is too elaborately put
i mean that leonora if everything had prospered might have become too hard and maybe overbearing
as it was she was tuned down to appearing efficientand yet sympathetic
that is the rarest of all blends
and yet i swear that leonora in her restrained way gave the impression of being intensely sympathetic
when she listened to you she appeared also to be listening to some sound that was going on in the distance
but still she listened to you and took in what you said which since the record of humanity is a record of sorrows was as a rule something sad
i think that she must have taken nancy through many terrors of the night and many bad places of the day
and that would account for the girl's passionate love for the elder woman
for nancy's love for leonora was an admiration that is awakened in catholics by their feeling for the virgin mary and for various of the saints
it is too little to say that the girl would have laid her life at leonora's feet
well she laid there the offer of her virtueand her reason
those were sufficient instalments of her life
it would today be much better for nancy rufford if she were dead
perhaps all these reflections are a nuisance but they crowd on me
i will try to tell the story
you seewhen she came back from nauheim leonora began to have her headachesheadaches lasting through whole days during which she could speak no word and could bear to hear no sound
and day after day nancy would sit with her silent and motionless for hours steeping handkerchiefs in vinegar and water and thinking her own thoughts
it must have been very bad for herand her meals alone with edward must have been bad for her tooand beastly bad for edward
edward of course wavered in his demeanour what else could he do
at times he would sit silent and dejected over his untouched food
he would utter nothing but monosyllables when nancy spoke to him
then he was simply afraid of the girl falling in love with him
at other times he would take a little wine pull himself together attempt to chaff nancy about a stake and binder hedge that her mare had checked at or talk about the habits of the chitralis
that was when he was thinking that it was rough on the poor girl that he should have become a dull companion
he realized that his talking to her in the park at nauheim had done her no harm
but all that was doing a great deal of harm to nancy
it gradually opened her eyes to the fact that edward was a man with his ups and downs and not an invariably gay uncle like a nice dog a trustworthy horse or a girl friend
she would find him in attitudes of frightful dejection sunk into his armchair in the study that was half a gunroom
she would notice through the open door that his face was the face of an old dead man when he had no one to talk to
gradually it forced itself upon her attention that there were profound differences between the pair that she regarded as her uncle and her aunt
it was a conviction that came very slowly
it began with edward's giving an oldish horse to a young fellow called selmes
selmes' father had been ruined by a fraudulent solicitor and the selmes family had had to sell their hunters
it was a case that had excited a good deal of sympathy in that part of the county
and edward meeting the young man one day unmounted and seeing him to be very unhappy had offered to give him an old irish cob upon which he was riding
it was a silly sort of thing to do really
the horse was worth from thirty to forty pounds and edward might have known that the gift would upset his wife
but edward just had to comfort that unhappy young man whose father he had known all his life
and what made it all the worse was that young selmes could not afford to keep the horse even
edward recollected this immediately after he had made the offer and said quickly  of course i mean that you should stable the horse at branshaw until you have time to turn round or want to sell him and get a better
nancy went straight home and told all this to leonora who was lying down
she regarded it as a splendid instance of edward's quick consideration for the feelings and the circumstances of the distressed
she thought it would cheer leonora upbecause it ought to cheer any woman up to know that she had such a splendid husband
that was the last girlish thought she ever had
for leonora whose headache had left her collected but miserably weak turned upon her bed and uttered words that were amazing to the girl  i wish to god she said that he was your husband and not mine
we shall be ruined
we shall be ruined
am i never to have a chance
and suddenly leonora burst into a passion of tears
she pushed herself up from the pillows with one elbow and sat therecrying crying crying with her face hidden in her hands and the tears falling through her fingers
the girl flushed stammered and whimpered as if she had been personally insulted
but if uncle edward she began
that man said leonora with an extraordinary bitterness would give the shirt off his back and off mineand off yours to any she could not finish the sentence
at that moment she had been feeling an extraordinary hatred and contempt for her husband
all the morning and all the afternoon she had been lying there thinking that edward and the girl were togetherin the field and hacking it home at dusk
she had been digging her sharp nails into her palms
the house had been very silent in the drooping winter weather
and then after an eternity of torture there had invaded it the sound of opening doors of the girl's gay voice saying  well it was only under the mistletoe
and there was edward's gruff undertone
then nancy had come in with feet that had hastened up the stairs and that tiptoed as they approached the open door of leonora's room
branshaw had a great big hall with oak floors and tiger skins
round this hall there ran a gallery upon which leonora's doorway gave
and even when she had the worst of her headaches she liked to have her door openi suppose so that she might hear the approaching footsteps of ruin and disaster
at any rate she hated to be in a room with a shut door
at that moment leonora hated edward with a hatred that was like hell and she would have liked to bring her ridingwhip down across the girl's face
what right had nancy to be young and slender and dark and gay at times at times mournful
what right had she to be exactly the woman to make leonora's husband happy
for leonora knew that nancy would have made edward happy
yes leonora wished to bring her ridingwhip down on nancy's young face
she imagined the pleasure she would feel when the lash fell across those queer features the pleasure she would feel at drawing the handle at the same moment toward her so as to cut deep into the flesh and to leave a lasting wheal
well she left a lasting wheal and her words cut deeply into the girl's mind
they neither of them spoke about that again
a fortnight went bya fortnight of deep rains of heavy fields of bad scent
leonora's headaches seemed to have gone for good
she hunted once or twice letting herself be piloted by bayham whilst edward looked after the girl
then one evening when those three were dining alone edward said in the queer deliberate heavy tones that came out of him in those days he was looking at the table  i have been thinking that nancy ought to do more for her father
he is getting an old man
i have written to colonel rufford suggesting that she should go to him
leonora called out  how dare you
how dare you
the girl put her hand over her heart and cried out oh my sweet saviour help me
that was the queer way she thought within her mind and the words forced themselves to her lips
edward said nothing
and that night by a merciless trick of the devil that pays attention to this sweltering hell of ours nancy rufford had a letter from her mother
it came whilst leonora was talking to edward or leonora would have intercepted it as she had intercepted others
it was an amazing and a horrible letter 
i don't know what it contained
i just average out from its effects on nancy that her mother having eloped with some worthless sort of fellow had done what is called sinking lower and lower
whether she was actually on the streets i do not know but i rather think that she eked out a small allowance that she had from her husband by that means of livelihood
and i think that she stated as much in her letter to nancy and upbraided the girl with living in luxury whilst her mother starved
and it must have been horrible in tone for mrs rufford was a cruel sort of woman at the best of times
it must have seemed to that poor girl opening her letter for distraction from another grief up in her bedroom like the laughter of a devil
i just cannot bear to think of my poor dear girl at that moment  and at the same time leonora was lashing like a cold fiend into the unfortunate edward
or perhaps he was not so unfortunate because he had done what he knew to be the right thing he may be deemed happy
i leave it to you
at any rate he was sitting in his deep chair and leonora came into his roomfor the first time in nine years
she said  this is the most atrocious thing you have done in your atrocious life
he never moved and he never looked at her
god knows what was in leonora's mind exactly
i like to think that uppermost in it was concern and horror at the thought of the poor girl's going back to a father whose voice made her shriek in the night
and indeed that motive was very strong with leonora
but i think there was also present the thought that she wanted to go on torturing edward with the girl's presence
she was at that time capable of that
edward was sunk in his chair there were in the room two candles hidden by green glass shades
the green shades were reflected in the glasses of the bookcases that contained not books but guns with gleaming brown barrels and fishingrods in green baize overcovers
there was dimly to be seen above a mantelpiece encumbered with spurs hooves and bronze models of horses a darkbrown picture of a white horse
if you think leonora said that i do not know that you are in love with the girl she began spiritedly but she could not find any ending for the sentence
edward did not stir he never spoke
and then leonora said  if you want me to divorce you i will
you can marry her then
she's in love with you
he groaned at that a little leonora said
then she went away
heaven knows what happened in leonora after that
she certainly does not herself know
she probably said a good deal more to edward than i have been able to report but that is all that she has told me and i am not going to make up speeches
to follow her psychological development of that moment i think we must allow that she upbraided him for a great deal of their past life whilst edward sat absolutely silent
and indeed in speaking of it afterwards she has said several times i said a great deal more to him than i wanted to just because he was so silent
she talked in fact in the endeavour to sting him into speech
she must have said so much that with the expression of her grievance her mood changed
she went back to her own room in the gallery and sat there for a long time thinking
and she thought herself into a mood of absolute unselfishness of absolute selfcontempt too
she said to herself that she was no good that she had failed in all her effortsin her efforts to get edward back as in her efforts to make him curb his expenditure
she imagined herself to be exhausted she imagined herself to be done
then a great fear came over her
she thought that edward after what she had said to him must have committed suicide
she went out on to the gallery and listened there was no sound in all the house except the regular beat of the great clock in the hall
but even in her debased condition she was not the person to hang about
she acted
she went straight to edward's room opened the door and looked in
he was oiling the breech action of a gun
it was an unusual thing for him to do at that time of night in his evening clothes
it never occurred to her nevertheless that he was going to shoot himself with that implement
she knew that he was doing it just for occupationto keep himself from thinking
he looked up when she opened the door his face illuminated by the light cast upwards from the round orifices in the green candle shades
she said  i didn't imagine that i should find nancy here
she thought that she owed that to him
he answered then  i don't imagine that you did imagine it
those were the only words he spoke that night
she went like a lame duck back through the long corridors she stumbled over the familiar tiger skins in the dark hall
she could hardly drag one limb after the other
in the gallery she perceived that nancy's door was half open and that there was a light in the girl's room
a sudden madness possessed her a desire for action a thirst for selfexplanation
their rooms all gave on to the gallery leonora's to the east the girl's next then edward's
the sight of those three open doors side by side gaping to receive whom the chances of the black night might bring made leonora shudder all over her body
she went into nancy's room
the girl was sitting perfectly still in an armchair very upright as she had been taught to sit at the convent
she appeared to be as calm as a church her hair fell black and like a pall down over both her shoulders
the fire beside her was burning brightly she must have just put coals on
she was in a white silk kimono that covered her to the feet
the clothes that she had taken off were exactly folded upon the proper seats
her long hands were one upon each arm of the chair that had a pink and white chintz back
leonora told me these things
she seemed to think it extraordinary that the girl could have done such orderly things as fold up the clothes she had taken off upon such a nightwhen edward had announced that he was going to send her to her father and when from her mother she had received that letter
the letter in its envelope was in her right hand
leonora did not at first perceive it
she said  what are you doing so late
the girl answered just thinking
they seemed to think in whispers and to speak below their breaths
then leonora's eyes fell on the envelope and she recognized mrs rufford's handwriting
it was one of those moments when thinking was impossible leonora said
it was as if stones were being thrown at her from every direction and she could only run
she heard herself exclaim edward's dyingbecause of you
he's dying
he's worth more than either of us  the girl looked past her at the panels of the halfclosed door
my poor father she said my poor father
you must stay here leonora answered fiercely
you must stay here
i tell you you must stay here
i am going to glasgow nancy answered
i shall go to glasgow tomorrow morning
my mother is in glasgow
it appears that it was in glasgow that mrs rufford pursued her disorderly life
she had selected that city not because it was more profitable but because it was the natal home of her husband to whom she desired to cause as much pain as possible
you must stay here leonora began to save edward
he's dying for love of you
the girl turned her calm eyes upon leonora
i know it she said
and i am dying for love of him
leonora uttered an ah that in spite of herself was an ah of horror and of grief
that is why the girl continued i am going to glasgowto take my mother away from there
she added to the ends of the earth for if the last months had made her nature that of a woman her phrases were still romantically those of a schoolgirl
it was as if she had grown up so quickly that there had not been time to put her hair up
but she added we're no goodmy mother and i
leonora said with her fierce calmness  no
no
you're not no good
it's i that am no good
you can't let that man go on to ruin for want of you
you must belong to him
the girl she said smiled at her with a queer faraway smileas if she were a thousand years old as if leonora were a tiny child
i knew you would come to that she said very slowly
but we are not worth itedward and i
iii  nancy had in fact been thinking ever since leonora had made that comment over the giving of the horse to young selmes
she had been thinking and thinking because she had had to sit for many days silent beside her aunt's bed
she had always thought of leonora as her aunt
and she had had to sit thinking during many silent meals with edward
and then at times with his bloodshot eyes and creased heavy mouth he would smile at her
and gradually the knowledge had come to her that edward did not love leonora and that leonora hated edward
several things contributed to form and to harden this conviction
she was allowed to read the papers in those daysor rather since leonora was always on her bed and edward breakfasted alone and went out early over the estate she was left alone with the papers
one day in the papers she saw the portrait of a woman she knew very well
beneath it she read the words the hon
mrs brand plaintiff in the remarkable divorce case reported on p

nancy hardly knew what a divorce case was
she had been so remarkably well brought up and roman catholics do not practise divorce
i don't know how leonora had done it exactly
i suppose she had always impressed it on nancy's mind that nice women did not read these things and that would have been enough to make nancy skip those pages
she read at any rate the account of the brand divorce caseprincipally because she wanted to tell leonora about it
she imagined that leonora when her headache left her would like to know what was happening to mrs brand who lived at christchurch and whom they both liked very well
the case occupied three days and the report that nancy first came upon was that of the third day
edward however kept the papers of the week after his methodical fashion in a rack in his gunroom and when she had finished her breakfast nancy went to that quiet apartment and had what she would have called a good read
it seemed to her to be a queer affair
she could not understand why one counsel should be so anxious to know all about the movements of mr brand upon a certain day she could not understand why a chart of the bedroom accommodation at christchurch old hall should be produced in court
she did not even see why they should want to know that upon a certain occasion the drawingroom door was locked
it made her laugh it appeared to be all so senseless that grown people should occupy themselves with such matters
it struck her nevertheless as odd that one of the counsel should crossquestion mr brand so insistently and so impertinently as to his feelings for miss lupton
nancy knew miss lupton of ringwood very wella jolly girl who rode a horse with two white fetlocks
mr brand persisted that he did not love miss lupton well of course he did not love miss lupton he was a married man
you might as well think of uncle edward loving loving anybody but leonora
when people were married there was an end of loving
there were no doubt people who misbehavedbut they were poor peopleor people not like those she knew
so these matters presented themselves to nancy's mind
but later on in the case she found that mr brand had to confess to a guilty intimacy with some one or other
nancy imagined that he must have been telling some one his wife's secrets she could not understand why that was a serious offence
of course it was not very gentlemanlyit lessened her opinion of mrs brand
but since she found that mrs brand had condoned that offence she imagined that they could not have been very serious secrets that mr brand had told
and then suddenly it was forced on her conviction that mr brandthe mild mr brand that she had seen a month or two before their departure to nauheim playing blind man's buff with his children and kissing his wife when he caught hermr brand and mrs brand had been on the worst possible terms
that was incredible
yet there it wasin black and white
mr brand drank mr brand had struck mrs brand to the ground when he was drunk
mr brand was adjudged in two or three abrupt words at the end of columns and columns of paper to have been guilty of cruelty to his wife and to have committed adultery with miss lupton
the last words conveyed nothing to nancynothing real that is to say
she knew that one was commanded not to commit adulterybut why she thought should one
it was probably something like catching salmon out of seasona thing one did not do
she gathered it had something to do with kissing or holding some one in your arms   and yet the whole effect of that reading upon nancy was mysterious terrifying and evil
she felt a sicknessa sickness that grew as she read
her heart beat painfully she began to cry
she asked god how he could permit such things to be
and she was more certain that edward did not love leonora and that leonora hated edward
perhaps then edward loved some one else
it was unthinkable
if he could love some one else than leonora her fierce unknown heart suddenly spoke in her side why could it not be herself
and he did not love her
this had occurred about a month before she got the letter from her mother
she let the matter rest until the sick feeling went off it did that in a day or two
then finding that leonora's headaches had gone she suddenly told leonora that mrs brand had divorced her husband
she asked what exactly it all meant
leonora was lying on the sofa in the hall she was feeling so weak that she could hardly find the words
she answered just  it means that mr brand will be able to marry again
nancy said  but but and then he will be able to marry miss lupton
leonora just moved a hand in assent
her eyes were shut
then nancy began
her blue eyes were full of horror her brows were tight above them the lines of pain about her mouth were very distinct
in her eyes the whole of that familiar great hall had a changed aspect
the andirons with the brass flowers at the ends appeared unreal the burning logs were just logs that were burning and not the comfortable symbols of an indestructible mode of life
the flame fluttered before the high fireback the st bernard sighed in his sleep
outside the winter rain fell and fell
and suddenly she thought that edward might marry some one else and she nearly screamed
leonora opened her eyes lying sideways with her face upon the black and gold pillow of the sofa that was drawn half across the great fireplace
i thought nancy said i never imagined aren't marriages sacraments
aren't they indissoluble
i thought you were married
 and she was sobbing
i thought you were married or not married as you are alive or dead
that leonora said is the law of the church
it is not the law of the land  oh yes nancy said the brands are protestants
she felt a sudden safeness descend upon her and for an hour or so her mind was at rest
it seemed to her idiotic not to have remembered henry viii and the basis upon which protestantism rests
she almost laughed at herself
the long afternoon wore on the flames still fluttered when the maid made up the fire the st bernard awoke and lolloped away towards the kitchen
and then leonora opened her eyes and said almost coldly  and you
don't you think you will get married
it was so unlike leonora that for the moment the girl was frightened in the dusk
but then again it seemed a perfectly reasonable question
i don't know she answered
i don't know that anyone wants to marry me
several people want to marry you leonora said
but i don't want to marry nancy answered
i should like to go on living with you and edward
i don't think i am in the way or that i am really an expense
if i went you would have to have a companion
or perhaps i ought to earn my living  i wasn't thinking of that leonora answered in the same dull tone
you will have money enough from your father
but most people want to be married
i believe that she then asked the girl if she would not like to marry me and that nancy answered that she would marry me if she were told to but that she wanted to go on living there
she added  if i married anyone i should want him to be like edward
she was frightened out of her life
leonora writhed on her couch and called out oh god
nancy ran for the maid for tablets of aspirin for wet handkerchiefs
it never occurred to her that leonora's expression of agony was for anything else than physical pain
you are to remember that all this happened a month before leonora went into the girl's room at night
i have been casting back again but i cannot help it
it is so difficult to keep all these people going
i tell you about leonora and bring her up to date then about edward who has fallen behind
and then the girl gets hopelessly left behind
i wish i could put it down in diary form
thus on the st of september they returned from nauheim
leonora at once took to her bed
by the st of october they were all going to meets together
nancy had already observed very fully that edward was strange in his manner
about the th of that month edward gave the horse to young selmes and nancy had cause to believe that her aunt did not love her uncle
on the th she read the account of the divorce case which is reported in the papers of the th and the two following days
on the rd she had the conversation with her aunt in the hallabout marriage in general and about her own possible marriage her aunt's coming to her bedroom did not occur until the th of november
thus she had three weeks for introspectionfor introspection beneath gloomy skies in that old house rendered darker by the fact that it lay in a hollow crowned by fir trees with their black shadows
it was not a good situation for a girl
she began thinking about love she who had never before considered it as anything other than a rather humorous rather nonsensical matter
she remembered chance passages in chance booksthings that had not really affected her at all at the time
she remembered someone's love for the princess badrulbadour she remembered to have heard that love was a flame a thirst a withering up of the vitalsthough she did not know what the vitals were
she had a vague recollection that love was said to render a hopeless lover's eyes hopeless she remembered a character in a book who was said to have taken to drink through love she remembered that lovers' existences were said to be punctuated with heavy sighs
once she went to the little cottage piano that was in the corner of the hall and began to play
it was a tinkly reedy instrument for none of that household had any turn for music
nancy herself could play a few simple songs and she found herself playing
she had been sitting on the window seat looking out on the fading day
leonora had gone to pay some calls edward was looking after some planting up in the new spinney
thus she found herself playing on the old piano
she did not know how she came to be doing it
a silly lilting wavering tune came from before her in the duska tune in which major notes with their cheerful insistence wavered and melted into minor sounds as beneath a bridge the high lights on dark waters melt and waver and disappear into black depths
well it was a silly old tune
it goes with the wordsthey are about a willow tree i think thou art to all lost loves the best the only true plant found
that sort of thing
it is herrick i believe and the music with the reedy irregular lilting sound that goes with herrick and it was dusk the heavy hewn dark pillars that supported the gallery were like mourning presences the fire had sunk to nothinga mere glow amongst white ashes
it was a sentimental sort of place and light and hour  and suddenly nancy found that she was crying
she was crying quietly she went on to cry with long convulsive sobs
it seemed to her that everything gay everything charming all light all sweetness had gone out of life
unhappiness unhappiness unhappiness was all around her
she seemed to know no happy being and she herself was agonizing  she remembered that edward's eyes were hopeless she was certain that he was drinking too much at times he sighed deeply
he appeared as a man who was burning with inward flame drying up in the soul with thirst withering up in the vitals
then the torturing conviction came to herthe conviction that had visited her again and againthat edward must love some one other than leonora
with her little pedagogic sectarianism she remembered that catholics do not do this thing
but edward was a protestant
then edward loved somebody  and after that thought her eyes grew hopeless she sighed as the old st bernard beside her did
at meals she would feel an intolerable desire to drink a glass of wine and then another and then a third
then she would find herself grow gay
but in half an hour the gaiety went she felt like a person who is burning up with an inward flame desiccating at the soul with thirst withering up in the vitals
one evening she went into edward's gunroomhe had gone to a meeting of the national reserve committee
on the table beside his chair was a decanter of whisky
she poured out a wineglassful and drank it off
flame then really seemed to fill her body her legs swelled her face grew feverish
she dragged her tall height up to her room and lay in the dark
the bed reeled beneath her she gave way to the thought that she was in edward's arms that he was kissing her on her face that burned on her shoulders that burned and on her neck that was on fire
she never touched alcohol again
not once after that did she have such thoughts
they died out of her mind they left only a feeling of shame so insupportable that her brain could not take it in and they vanished
she imagined that her anguish at the thought of edward's love for another person was solely sympathy for leonora she determined that the rest of her life must be spent in acting as leonora's handmaidensweeping tending embroidering like some deborah some medieval sainti am not unfortunately up in the catholic hagiology
but i know that she pictured herself as some personage with a depressed earnest face and tightly closed lips in a clear white room watering flowers or tending an embroidery frame
or she desired to go with edward to africa and to throw herself in the path of a charging lion so that edward might be saved for leonora at the cost of her life
well along with her sad thoughts she had her childish ones
she knew nothingnothing of life except that one must live sadly
that she now knew
what happened to her on the night when she received at once the blow that edward wished her to go to her father in india and the blow of the letter from her mother was this
she called first upon her sweet saviourand she thought of our lord as her sweet saviourthat he might make it impossible that she should go to india
then she realized from edward's demeanour that he was determined that she should go to india
it must then be right that she should go
edward was always right in his determinations
he was the cid he was lohengrin he was the chevalier bayard
nevertheless her mind mutinied and revolted
she could not leave that house
she imagined that he wished her gone that she might not witness his amours with another girl
well she was prepared to tell him that she was ready to witness his amours with another young girl
she would stay thereto comfort leonora
then came the desperate shock of the letter from her mother
her mother said i believe something like you have no right to go on living your life of prosperity and respect
you ought to be on the streets with me
how do you know that you are even colonel rufford's daughter
she did not know what these words meant
she thought of her mother as sleeping beneath the arches whilst the snow fell
that was the impression conveyed to her mind by the words on the streets
a platonic sense of duty gave her the idea that she ought to go to comfort her motherthe mother that bore her though she hardly knew what the words meant
at the same time she knew that her mother had left her father with another mantherefore she pitied her father and thought it terrible in herself that she trembled at the sound of her father's voice
if her mother was that sort of woman it was natural that her father should have had accesses of madness in which he had struck herself to the ground
and the voice of her conscience said to her that her first duty was to her parents
it was in accord with this awakened sense of duty that she undressed with great care and meticulously folded the clothes that she took off
sometimes but not very often she threw them helterskelter about the room
and that sense of duty was her prevailing mood when leonora tall cleanrun goldenhaired all in black appeared in her doorway and told her that edward was dying of love for her
she knew then with her conscious mind what she had known within herself for monthsthat edward was dyingactually and physically dyingof love for her
it seemed to her that for one short moment her spirit could say domine nunc dimittis lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace
she imagined that she could cheerfully go away to glasgow and rescue her fallen mother
iv  and it seemed to her to be in tune with the mood with the hour and with the woman in front of her to say that she knew edward was dying of love for her and that she was dying of love for edward
for that fact had suddenly slipped into place and become real for her as the niched marker on a whist tablet slips round with the pressure of your thumb
that rubber at least was made
and suddenly leonora seemed to have become different and she seemed to have become different in her attitude towards leonora
it was as if she in her frail white silken kimono sat beside her fire but upon a throne
it was as if leonora in her close dress of black lace with the gleaming white shoulders and the coiled yellow hair that the girl had always considered the most beautiful thing in the worldit was as if leonora had become pinched shrivelled blue with cold shivering suppliant
yet leonora was commanding her
it was no good commanding her
she was going on the morrow to her mother who was in glasgow
leonora went on saying that she must stay there to save edward who was dying of love for her
and proud and happy in the thought that edward loved her and that she loved him she did not even listen to what leonora said
it appeared to her that it was leonora's business to save her husband's body she nancy possessed his soula precious thing that she would shield and bear away up in her armsas if leonora were a hungry dog trying to spring up at a lamb that she was carrying
yes she felt as if edward's love were a precious lamb that she were bearing away from a cruel and predatory beast
for at that time leonora appeared to her as a cruel and predatory beast
leonora leonora with her hunger with her cruelty had driven edward to madness
he must be sheltered by his love for her and by her loveher love from a great distance and unspoken enveloping him surrounding him upholding him by her voice speaking from glasgow saying that she loved that she adored that she passed no moment without longing loving quivering at the thought of him
leonora said loudly insistently with a bitterly imperative tone  you must stay here you must belong to edward
i will divorce him
the girl answered  the church does not allow of divorce
i cannot belong to your husband
i am going to glasgow to rescue my mother
the halfopened door opened noiselessly to the full
edward was there
his devouring doomed eyes were fixed on the girl's face his shoulders slouched forward he was undoubtedly half drunk and he had the whisky decanter in one hand a slanting candlestick in the other
he said with a heavy ferocity to nancy  i forbid you to talk about these things
you are to stay here until i hear from your father
then you will go to your father
the two women looking at each other like beasts about to spring hardly gave a glance to him
he leaned against the doorpost
he said again  nancy i forbid you to talk about these things
i am the master of this house
and at the sound of his voice heavy male coming from a deep chest in the night with the blackness behind him nancy felt as if her spirit bowed before him with folded hands
she felt that she would go to india and that she desired never again to talk of these things
leonora said  you see that it is your duty to belong to him
he must not be allowed to go on drinking
nancy did not answer
edward was gone they heard him slipping and shambling on the polished oak of the stairs
nancy screamed when there came the sound of a heavy fall
leonora said again you see
the sounds went on from the hall below the light of the candle edward held flickered up between the hand rails of the gallery
then they heard his voice  give me glasgow glasgow in scotland
i want the number of a man called white of simrock park glasgow edward white simrock park glasgow ten minutes at this time of night his voice was quite level normal and patient
alcohol took him in the legs not the speech
i can wait his voice came again
yes i know they have a number
i have been in communication with them before
he is going to telephone to your mother leonora said
he will make it all right for her
she got up and closed the door
she came back to the fire and added bitterly he can always make it all right for everybody except meexcepting me
the girl said nothing
she sat there in a blissful dream
she seemed to see her lover sitting as he always sat in a roundbacked chair in the dark hallsitting low with the receiver at his ear talking in a gentle slow voice that he reserved for the telephoneand saving the world and her in the black darkness
she moved her hand over the bareness of the base of her throat to have the warmth of flesh upon it and upon her bosom
she said nothing leonora went on talking  god knows what leonora said
she repeated that the girl must belong to her husband
she said that she used that phrase because though she might have a divorce or even a dissolution of the marriage by the church it would still be adultery that the girl and edward would be committing
but she said that that was necessary it was the price that the girl must pay for the sin of having made edward love her for the sin of loving her husband
she talked on and on beside the fire
the girl must become an adulteress she had wronged edward by being so beautiful so gracious so good
it was sinful to be so good
she must pay the price so as to save the man she had wronged
in between her pauses the girl could hear the voice of edward droning on indistinguishably with jerky pauses for replies
it made her glow with pride the man she loved was working for her
he at least was resolved was malely determined knew the right thing
leonora talked on with her eyes boring into nancy's
the girl hardly looked at her and hardly heard her
after a long time nancy saidafter hours and hours  i shall go to india as soon as edward hears from my father
i cannot talk about these things because edward does not wish it
at that leonora screamed out and wavered swiftly towards the closed door
and nancy found that she was springing out of her chair with her white arms stretched wide
she was clasping the other woman to her breast she was saying  oh my poor dear oh my poor dear
and they sat crouching together in each other's arms and crying and crying and they lay down in the same bed talking and talking all through the night
and all through the night edward could hear their voices through the wall
that was how it went next morning they were all three as if nothing had happened
towards eleven edward came to nancy who was arranging some christmas roses in a silver bowl
he put a telegram beside her on the table
you can uncode it for yourself he said
then as he went out of the door he said you can tell your aunt i have cabled to mr dowell to come over
he will make things easier till you leave
the telegram when it was uncoded read as far as i can remember will take mrs rufford to italy
undertake to do this for certain
am devotedly attached to mrs rufford
have no need of financial assistance
did not know there was a daughter and am much obliged to you for pointing out my dutywhite
it was something like that
then the household resumed its wonted course of days until my arrival
v  it is this part of the story that makes me saddest of all
for i ask myself unceasingly my mind going round and round in a weary baffled space of painwhat should these people have done
what in the name of god should they have done
the end was perfectly plain to each of themit was perfectly manifest at this stage that if the girl did not in leonora's phrase belong to edward edward must die the girl must lose her reason because edward diedand that after a time leonora who was the coldest and the strongest of the three would console herself by marrying rodney bayham and have a quiet comfortable good time
that end on that night whilst leonora sat in the girl's bedroom and edward telephoned down belowthat end was plainly manifest
the girl plainly was halfmad already edward was half dead only leonora active persistent instinct with her cold passion of energy was doing things
what then should they have done
worked out in the extinction of two very splendid personalitiesfor edward and the girl were splendid personalities in order that a third personality more normal should have after a long period of trouble a quiet comfortable good time
i am writing this now i should say a full eighteen months after the words that end my last chapter
since writing the words until my arrival which i see end that paragraph i have seen again for a glimpse from a swift train beaucaire with the beautiful white tower tarascon with the square castle the great rhone the immense stretches of the crau
i have rushed through all provenceand all provence no longer matters
it is no longer in the olive hills that i shall find my heaven because there is only hell   edward is dead the girl is goneoh utterly gone leonora is having a good time with rodney bayham and i sit alone in branshaw teleragh
i have been through provence i have seen africa i have visited asia to see in ceylon in a darkened room my poor girl sitting motionless with her wonderful hair about her looking at me with eyes that did not see me and saying distinctly credo in unum deum omnipotentem credo in unum deum omnipotentem
those are the only reasonable words she uttered those are the only words it appears that she ever will utter
i suppose that they are reasonable words it must be extraordinarily reasonable for her if she can say that she believes in an omnipotent deity
well there it is
i am very tired of it all  for i daresay all this may sound romantic but it is tiring tiring tiring to have been in the midst of it to have taken the tickets to have caught the trains to have chosen the cabins to have consulted the purser and the stewards as to diet for the quiescent patient who did nothing but announce her belief in an omnipotent deity
that may sound romanticbut it is just a record of fatigue
i don't know why i should always be selected to be serviceable
i don't resent itbut i have never been the least good
florence selected me for her own purposes and i was no good to her edward called me to come and have a chat with him and i couldn't stop him cutting his throat
and then one day eighteen months ago i was quietly writing in my room at branshaw when leonora came to me with a letter
it was a very pathetic letter from colonel rufford about nancy
colonel rufford had left the army and had taken up an appointment at a teaplanting estate in ceylon
his letter was pathetic because it was so brief so inarticulate and so businesslike
he had gone down to the boat to meet his daughter and had found his daughter quite mad
it appears that at aden nancy had seen in a local paper the news of edward's suicide
in the red sea she had gone mad
she had remarked to mrs colonel luton who was chaperoning her that she believed in an omnipotent deity
she hadn't made any fuss her eyes were quite dry and glassy
even when she was mad nancy could behave herself
colonel rufford said the doctor did not anticipate that there was any chance of his child's recovery
it was nevertheless possible that if she could see someone from branshaw it might soothe her and it might have a good effect
and he just simply wrote to leonora please come and see if you can do it
i seem to have lost all sense of the pathetic but still that simple enormous request of the old colonel strikes me as pathetic
he was cursed by his atrocious temper he had been cursed by a halfmad wife who drank and went on the streets
his daughter was totally madand yet he believed in the goodness of human nature
he believed that leonora would take the trouble to go all the way to ceylon in order to soothe his daughter
leonora wouldn't
leonora didn't ever want to see nancy again
i daresay that that in the circumstances was natural enough
at the same time she agreed as it were on public grounds that someone soothing ought to go from branshaw to ceylon
she sent me and her old nurse who had looked after nancy from the time when the girl a child of thirteen had first come to branshaw
so off i go rushing through provence to catch the steamer at marseilles
and i wasn't the least good when i got to ceylon and the nurse wasn't the least good
nothing has been the least good
the doctors said at kandy that if nancy could be brought to england the sea air the change of climate the voyage and all the usual sort of things might restore her reason
of course they haven't restored her reason
she is i am aware sitting in the hall forty paces from where i am now writing
i don't want to be in the least romantic about it
she is very well dressed she is quite quiet she is very beautiful
the old nurse looks after her very efficiently
of course you have the makings of a situation here but it is all very humdrum as far as i am concerned
i should marry nancy if her reason were ever sufficiently restored to let her appreciate the meaning of the anglican marriage service
but it is probable that her reason will never be sufficiently restored to let her appreciate the meaning of the anglican marriage service
therefore i cannot marry her according to the law of the land
so here i am very much where i started thirteen years ago
i am the attendant not the husband of a beautiful girl who pays no attention to me
i am estranged from leonora who married rodney bayham in my absence and went to live at bayham
leonora rather dislikes me because she has got it into her head that i disapprove of her marriage with rodney bayham
well i disapprove of her marriage
possibly i am jealous
yes no doubt i am jealous
in my fainter sort of way i seem to perceive myself following the lines of edward ashburnham
i suppose that i should really like to be a polygamist with nancy and with leonora and with maisie maidan and possibly even with florence
i am no doubt like every other man only probably because of my american origin i am fainter
at the same time i am able to assure you that i am a strictly respectable person
i have never done anything that the most anxious mother of a daughter or the most careful dean of a cathedral would object to
i have only followed faintly and in my unconscious desires edward ashburnham
well it is all over
not one of us has got what he really wanted
leonora wanted edward and she has got rodney bayham a pleasant enough sort of sheep
florence wanted branshaw and it is i who have bought it from leonora
i didn't really want it what i wanted mostly was to cease being a nurseattendant
well i am a nurseattendant
edward wanted nancy rufford and i have got her
only she is mad
it is a queer and fantastic world
why can't people have what they want
the things were all there to content everybody yet everybody has the wrong thing
perhaps you can make head or tail of it it is beyond me
is there any terrestial paradise where amidst the whispering of the oliveleaves people can be with whom they like and have what they like and take their ease in shadows and in coolness
or are all men's lives like the lives of us good peoplelike the lives of the ashburnhams of the dowells of the ruffordsbroken tumultuous agonized and unromantic lives periods punctuated by screams by imbecilities by deaths by agonies
who the devil knows
for there was a great deal of imbecility about the closing scenes of the ashburnham tragedy
neither of those two women knew what they wanted
it was only edward who took a perfectly clear line and he was drunk most of the time
but drunk or sober he stuck to what was demanded by convention and by the traditions of his house
nancy rufford had to be exported to india and nancy rufford hadn't to hear a word of love from him
she was exported to india and she never heard a word from edward ashburnham
it was the conventional line it was in tune with the tradition of edward's house
i daresay it worked out for the greatest good of the body politic
conventions and traditions i suppose work blindly but surely for the preservation of the normal type for the extinction of proud resolute and unusual individuals
edward was the normal man but there was too much of the sentimentalist about him and society does not need too many sentimentalists
nancy was a splendid creature but she had about her a touch of madness
society does not need individuals with touches of madness about them
so edward and nancy found themselves steamrolled out and leonora survives the perfectly normal type married to a man who is rather like a rabbit
for rodney bayham is rather like a rabbit and i hear that leonora is expected to have a baby in three months' time
so those splendid and tumultuous creatures with their magnetism and their passionsthose two that i really lovedhave gone from this earth
it is no doubt best for them
what would nancy have made of edward if she had succeeded in living with him what would edward have made of her
for there was about nancy a touch of crueltya touch of definite actual cruelty that made her desire to see people suffer
yes she desired to see edward suffer
and by god she gave him hell
she gave him an unimaginable hell
those two women pursued that poor devil and flayed the skin off him as if they had done it with whips
i tell you his mind bled almost visibly
i seem to see him stand naked to the waist his forearms shielding his eyes and flesh hanging from him in rags
i tell you that is no exaggeration of what i feel
it was as if leonora and nancy banded themselves together to do execution for the sake of humanity upon the body of a man who was at their disposal
they were like a couple of sioux who had got hold of an apache and had him well tied to a stake
i tell you there was no end to the tortures they inflicted upon him
night after night he would hear them talking talking maddened sweating seeking oblivion in drink he would lie there and hear the voices going on and on
and day after day leonora would come to him and would announce the results of their deliberations
they were like judges debating over the sentence upon a criminal they were like ghouls with an immobile corpse in a tomb beside them
i don't think that leonora was any more to blame than the girlthough leonora was the more active of the two
leonora as i have said was the perfectly normal woman
i mean to say that in normal circumstances her desires were those of the woman who is needed by society
she desired children decorum an establishment she desired to avoid waste she desired to keep up appearances
she was utterly and entirely normal even in her utterly undeniable beauty
but i don't mean to say that she acted perfectly normally in this perfectly abnormal situation
all the world was mad around her and she herself agonized took on the complexion of a mad woman of a woman very wicked of the villain of the piece
what would you have
steel is a normal hard polished substance
but if you put it in a hot fire it will become red soft and not to be handled
if you put it in a fire still more hot it will drip away
it was like that with leonora
she was made for normal circumstancesfor mr rodney bayham who will keep a separate establishment secretly in portsmouth and make occasional trips to paris and to budapest
in the case of edward and the girl leonora broke and simply went all over the place
she adopted unfamiliar and therefore extraordinary and ungraceful attitudes of mind
at one moment she was all for revenge
after haranguing the girl for hours through the night she harangued for hours of the day the silent edward
and edward just once tripped up and that was his undoing
perhaps he had had too much whisky that afternoon
she asked him perpetually what he wanted
what did he want
what did he want
and all he ever answered was i have told you
he meant that he wanted the girl to go to her father in india as soon as her father should cable that he was ready to receive her
but just once he tripped up
to leonora's eternal question he answered that all he desired in life was thatthat he could pick himself together again and go on with his daily occupations ifthe girl being five thousand miles away would continue to love him
he wanted nothing more he prayed his god for nothing more
well he was a sentimentalist
and the moment that she heard that leonora determined that the girl should not go five thousand miles away and that she should not continue to love edward
the way she worked it was this  she continued to tell the girl that she must belong to edward she was going to get a divorce she was going to get a dissolution of marriage from rome
but she considered it to be her duty to warn the girl of the sort of monster that edward was
she told the girl of la dolciquita of mrs basil of maisie maidan of florence
she spoke of the agonies that she had endured during her life with the man who was violent overbearing vain drunken arrogant and monstrously a prey to his sexual necessities
and at hearing of the miseries her aunt had sufferedfor leonora once more had the aspect of an aunt to the girlwith the swift cruelty of youth and with the swift solidarity that attaches woman to woman the girl made her resolves
her aunt said incessantly you must save edward's life you must save his life
all that he needs is a little period of satisfaction from you
then he will tire of you as he has of the others
but you must save his life
and all the while that wretched fellow knewby a curious instinct that runs between human beings living togetherexactly what was going on
and he remained dumb he stretched out no finger to help himself
all that he required to keep himself a decent member of society was that the girl five thousand miles away should continue to love him
they were putting a stopper upon that
i have told you that the girl came one night to his room
and that was the real hell for him
that was the picture that never left his imaginationthe girl in the dim light rising up at the foot of his bed
he said that it seemed to have a greenish sort of effect as if there were a greenish tinge in the shadows of the tall bedposts that framed her body
and she looked at him with her straight eyes of an unflinching cruelty and she said i am ready to belong to youto save your life
he answered i don't want it i don't want it i don't want it
and he says that he didn't want it that he would have hated himself that it was unthinkable
and all the while he had the immense temptation to do the unthinkable thing not from the physical desire but because of a mental certitude
he was certain that if she had once submitted to him she would remain his for ever
he knew that
she was thinking that her aunt had said he had desired her to love him from a distance of five thousand miles
she said i can never love you now i know the kind of man you are
i will belong to you to save your life
but i can never love you
it was a fantastic display of cruelty
she didn't in the least know what it meantto belong to a man
but at that edward pulled himself together
he spoke in his normal tones gruff husky overbearing as he would have done to a servant or to a horse
go back to your room he said
go back to your room and go to sleep
this is all nonsense
they were baffled those two women
and then i came on the scene
vi  my coming on the scene certainly calmed things downfor the whole fortnight that intervened between my arrival and the girl's departure
i don't mean to say that the endless talking did not go on at night or that leonora did not send me out with the girl and in the interval give edward a hell of a time
having discovered what he wantedthat the girl should go five thousand miles away and love him steadfastly as people do in sentimental novels she was determined to smash that aspiration
and she repeated to edward in every possible tone that the girl did not love him that the girl detested him for his brutality his overbearingness his drinking habits
she pointed out that edward in the girl's eyes was already pledged three or four deep
he was pledged to leonora herself to mrs basil and to the memories of maisie maidan and to florence
edward never said anything
did the girl love edward or didn't she
i don't know
at that time i daresay she didn't though she certainly had done so before leonora had got to work upon his reputation
she certainly had loved him for what i call the public side of his recordfor his good soldiering for his saving lives at sea for the excellent landlord that he was and the good sportsman
but it is quite possible that all those things came to appear as nothing in her eyes when she discovered that he wasn't a good husband
for though women as i see them have little or no feeling of responsibility towards a county or a country or a careeralthough they may be entirely lacking in any kind of communal solidaritythey have an immense and automatically working instinct that attaches them to the interest of womanhood
it is of course possible for any woman to cut out and to carry off any other woman's husband or lover
but i rather think that a woman will only do this if she has reason to believe that the other woman has given her husband a bad time
i am certain that if she thinks the man has been a brute to his wife she will with her instinctive feeling for suffering femininity put him back as the saying is
i don't attach any particular importance to these generalizations of mine
they may be right they may be wrong i am only an ageing american with very little knowledge of life
you may take my generalizations or leave them
but i am pretty certain that i am right in the case of nancy ruffordthat she had loved edward ashburnham very deeply and tenderly
it is nothing to the point that she let him have it good and strong as soon as she discovered that he had been unfaithful to leonora and that his public services had cost more than leonora thought they ought to have cost
nancy would be bound to let him have it good and strong then
she would owe that to feminine public opinion she would be driven to it by the instinct for selfpreservation since she might well imagine that if edward had been unfaithful to leonora to mrs basil and to the memories of the other two he might be unfaithful to herself
and no doubt she had her share of the sex instinct that makes women be intolerably cruel to the beloved person
anyhow i don't know whether at this point nancy rufford loved edward ashburnham
i don't know whether she even loved him when on getting at aden the news of his suicide she went mad
because that may just as well have been for the sake of leonora as for the sake of edward
or it may have been for the sake of both of them
i don't know
i know nothing
i am very tired
leonora held passionately the doctrine that the girl didn't love edward
she wanted desperately to believe that
it was a doctrine as necessary to her existence as a belief in the personal immortality of the soul
she said that it was impossible that nancy could have loved edward after she had given the girl her view of edward's career and character
edward on the other hand believed maunderingly that some essential attractiveness in himself must have made the girl continue to go on loving himto go on loving him as it were in underneath her official aspect of hatred
he thought she only pretended to hate him in order to save her face and he thought that her quite atrocious telegram from brindisi was only another attempt to do thatto prove that she had feelings creditable to a member of the feminine commonweal
i don't know
i leave it to you
there is another point that worries me a good deal in the aspects of this sad affair
leonora says that in desiring that the girl should go five thousand miles away and yet continue to love him edward was a monster of selfishness
he was desiring the ruin of a young life
edward on the other hand put it to me that supposing that the girl's love was a necessity to his existence and if he did nothing by word or by action to keep nancy's love alive he couldn't be called selfish
leonora replied that showed he had an abominably selfish nature even though his actions might be perfectly correct
i can't make out which of them was right
i leave it to you
it is at any rate certain that edward's actions were perfectlywere monstrously were cruellycorrect
he sat still and let leonora take away his character and let leonora damn him to deepest hell without stirring a finger
i daresay he was a fool i don't see what object there was in letting the girl think worse of him than was necessary
still there it is
and there it is also that all those three presented to the world the spectacle of being the best of good people
i assure you that during my stay for that fortnight in that fine old house i never so much as noticed a single thing that could have affected that good opinion
and even when i look back knowing the circumstances i can't remember a single thing any of them said that could have betrayed them
i can't remember right up to the dinner when leonora read out that telegramnot the tremor of an eyelash not the shaking of a hand
it was just a pleasant country houseparty
and leonora kept it up jolly well for even longer than thatshe kept it up as far as i was concerned until eight days after edward's funeral
immediately after that particular dinnerthe dinner at which i received the announcement that nancy was going to leave for india on the following dayi asked leonora to let me have a word with her
she took me into her little sittingroom and i then saidi spare you the record of my emotionsthat she was aware that i wished to marry nancy that she had seemed to favour my suit and that it appeared to be rather a waste of money upon tickets and rather a waste of time upon travel to let the girl go to india if leonora thought that there was any chance of her marrying me
and leonora i assure you was the absolutely perfect british matron
she said that she quite favoured my suit that she could not desire for the girl a better husband but that she considered that the girl ought to see a little more of life before taking such an important step
yes leonora used the words taking such an important step
she was perfect
actually i think she would have liked the girl to marry me enough but my programme included the buying of the kershaw's house about a mile away upon the fordingbridge road and settling down there with the girl
that didn't at all suit leonora
she didn't want to have the girl within a mile and a half of edward for the rest of their lives
still i think she might have managed to let me know in some periphrasis or other that i might have the girl if i would take her to philadelphia or timbuctoo
i loved nancy very muchand leonora knew it
however i left it at that
i left it with the understanding that nancy was going away to india on probation
it seemed to me a perfectly reasonable arrangement and i am a reasonable sort of man
i simply said that i should follow nancy out to india after six months' time or so
or perhaps after a year
well you see i did follow nancy out to india after a year
i must confess to having felt a little angry with leonora for not having warned me earlier that the girl would be going
i took it as one of the queer not very straight methods that roman catholics seem to adopt in dealing with matters of this world
i took it that leonora had been afraid i should propose to the girl or at any rate have made considerably greater advances to her than i did if i had known earlier that she was going away so soon
perhaps leonora was right perhaps roman catholics with their queer shifty ways are always right
they are dealing with the queer shifty thing that is human nature
for it is quite possible that if i had known nancy was going away so soon i should have tried making love to her
and that would have produced another complication
it may have been just as well
it is queer the fantastic things that quite good people will do in order to keep up their appearance of calm pococurantism
for edward ashburnham and his wife called me half the world over in order to sit on the back seat of a dogcart whilst edward drove the girl to the railway station from which she was to take her departure to india
they wanted i suppose to have a witness of the calmness of that function
the girl's luggage had been already packed and sent off before
her berth on the steamer had been taken
they had timed it all so exactly that it went like clockwork
they had known the date upon which colonel rufford would get edward's letter and they had known almost exactly the hour at which they would receive his telegram asking his daughter to come to him
it had all been quite beautifully and quite mercilessly arranged by edward himself
they gave colonel rufford as a reason for telegraphing the fact that mrs colonel somebody or other would be travelling by that ship and that she would serve as an efficient chaperon for the girl
it was a most amazing business and i think that it would have been better in the eyes of god if they had all attempted to gouge out each other's eyes with carving knives
but they were good people
after my interview with leonora i went desultorily into edward's gunroom
i didn't know where the girl was and i thought i might find her there
i suppose i had a vague idea of proposing to her in spite of leonora
so i presume i don't come of quite such good people as the ashburnhams
edward was lounging in his chair smoking a cigar and he said nothing for quite five minutes
the candles glowed in the green shades the reflections were green in the glasses of the bookcases that held guns and fishingrods
over the mantelpiece was the brownish picture of the white horse
those were the quietest moments that i have ever known
then suddenly edward looked me straight in the eyes and said  look here old man i wish you would drive with nancy and me to the station tomorrow
i said that of course i would drive with him and nancy to the station on the morrow
he lay there for a long time looking along the line of his knees at the fluttering fire and then suddenly in a perfectly calm voice and without lifting his eyes he said  i am so desperately in love with nancy rufford that i am dying of it
poor devilhe hadn't meant to speak of it
but i guess he just had to speak to somebody and i appeared to be like a woman or a solicitor
he talked all night
well he carried out the programme to the last breath
it was a very clear winter morning with a good deal of frost in it
the sun was quite bright the winding road between the heather and the bracken was very hard
i sat on the backseat of the dogcart nancy was beside edward
they talked about the way the cob went edward pointed out with the whip a cluster of deer upon a coombe threequarters of a mile away
we passed the hounds in the level bit of road beside the high trees going into fordingbridge and edward pulled up the dogcart so that nancy might say goodbye to the huntsman and cap him a last sovereign
she had ridden with those hounds ever since she had been thirteen
the train was five minutes late and they imagined that that was because it was marketday at swindon or wherever the train came from
that was the sort of thing they talked about
the train came in edward found her a firstclass carriage with an elderly woman in it
the girl entered the carriage edward closed the door and then she put out her hand to shake mine
there was upon those people's faces no expression of any kind whatever
the signal for the train's departure was a very bright red that is about as passionate a statement as i can get into that scene
she was not looking her best she had on a cap of brown fur that did not very well match her hair
she said  so long to edward
edward answered so long
he swung round on his heel and large slouching and walking with a heavy deliberate pace he went out of the station
i followed him and got up beside him in the high dogcart
it was the most horrible performance i have ever seen
and after that a holy peace like the peace of god which passes all understanding descended upon branshaw teleragh
leonora went about her daily duties with a sort of triumphant smilea very faint smile but quite triumphant
i guess she had so long since given up any idea of getting her man back that it was enough for her to have got the girl out of the house and well cured of her infatuation
once in the hall when leonora was going out edward said beneath his breathbut i just caught the words  thou hast conquered o pale galilean
it was like his sentimentality to quote swinburne
but he was perfectly quiet and he had given up drinking
the only thing that he ever said to me after that drive to the station was  it's very odd
i think i ought to tell you dowell that i haven't any feelings at all about the girl now it's all over
don't you worry about me
i'm all right
a long time afterwards he said i guess it was only a flash in the pan
he began to look after the estates again he took all that trouble over getting off the gardener's daughter who had murdered her baby
he shook hands smilingly with every farmer in the marketplace
he addressed two political meetings he hunted twice
leonora made him a frightful scene about spending the two hundred pounds on getting the gardener's daughter acquitted
everything went on as if the girl had never existed
it was very still weather
well that is the end of the story
and when i come to look at it i see that it is a happy ending with wedding bells and all
the villainsfor obviously edward and the girl were villainshave been punished by suicide and madness
the heroinethe perfectly normal virtuous and slightly deceitful heroinehas become the happy wife of a perfectly normal virtuous and slightly deceitful husband
she will shortly become a mother of a perfectly normal virtuous slightly deceitful son or daughter
a happy ending that is what it works out at
i cannot conceal from myself the fact that i now dislike leonora
without doubt i am jealous of rodney bayham
but i don't know whether it is merely a jealousy arising from the fact that i desired myself to possess leonora or whether it is because to her were sacrificed the only two persons that i have ever really lovededward ashburnham and nancy rufford
in order to set her up in a modern mansion replete with every convenience and dominated by a quite respectable and eminently economical master of the house it was necessary that edward and nancy rufford should become for me at least no more than tragic shades
i seem to see poor edward naked and reclining amidst darkness upon cold rocks like one of the ancient greek damned in tartarus or wherever it was
and as for nancy well yesterday at lunch she said suddenly  shuttlecocks
and she repeated the word shuttlecocks three times
i know what was passing in her mind if she can be said to have a mind for leonora has told me that once the poor girl said she felt like a shuttlecock being tossed backwards and forwards between the violent personalities of edward and his wife
leonora she said was always trying to deliver her over to edward and edward tacitly and silently forced her back again
and the odd thing was that edward himself considered that those two women used him like a shuttlecock
or rather he said that they sent him backwards and forwards like a blooming parcel that someone didn't want to pay the postage on
and leonora also imagined that edward and nancy picked her up and threw her down as suited their purely vagrant moods
so there you have the pretty picture
mind i am not preaching anything contrary to accepted morality
i am not advocating free love in this or any other case
society must go on i suppose and society can only exist if the normal if the virtuous and the slightly deceitful flourish and if the passionate the headstrong and the tootruthful are condemned to suicide and to madness
but i guess that i myself in my fainter way come into the category of the passionate of the headstrong and the tootruthful
for i can't conceal from myself the fact that i loved edward ashburnhamand that i love him because he was just myself
if i had had the courage and virility and possibly also the physique of edward ashburnham i should i fancy have done much what he did
he seems to me like a large elder brother who took me out on several excursions and did many dashing things whilst i just watched him robbing the orchards from a distance
and you see i am just as much of a sentimentalist as he was 
yes society must go on it must breed like rabbits
that is what we are here for
but then i don't like societymuch
i am that absurd figure an american millionaire who has bought one of the ancient haunts of english peace
i sit here in edward's gunroom all day and all day in a house that is absolutely quiet
no one visits me for i visit no one
no one is interested in me for i have no interests
in twenty minutes or so i shall walk down to the village beneath my own oaks alongside my own clumps of gorse to get the american mail
my tenants the village boys and the tradesmen will touch their hats to me
so life peters out
i shall return to dine and nancy will sit opposite me with the old nurse standing behind her
enigmatic silent utterly wellbehaved as far as her knife and fork go nancy will stare in front of her with the blue eyes that have over them strained stretched brows
once or perhaps twice during the meal her knife and fork will be suspended in midair as if she were trying to think of something that she had forgotten
then she will say that she believes in an omnipotent deity or she will utter the one word shuttlecocks perhaps
it is very extraordinary to see the perfect flush of health on her cheeks to see the lustre of her coiled black hair the poise of the head upon the neck the grace of the white handsand to think that it all means nothingthat it is a picture without a meaning
yes it is queer
but at any rate there is always leonora to cheer you up i don't want to sadden you
her husband is quite an economical person of so normal a figure that he can get quite a large proportion of his clothes readymade
that is the great desideratum of life and that is the end of my story
the child is to be brought up as a romanist
it suddenly occurs to me that i have forgotten to say how edward met his death
you remember that peace had descended upon the house that leonora was quietly triumphant and that edward said his love for the girl had been merely a passing phase
well one afternoon we were in the stables together looking at a new kind of flooring that edward was trying in a loosebox
edward was talking with a good deal of animation about the necessity of getting the numbers of the hampshire territorials up to the proper standard
he was quite sober quite quiet his skin was clearcoloured his hair was golden and perfectly brushed the level brickdust red of his complexion went clean up to the rims of his eyelids his eyes were porcelain blue and they regarded me frankly and directly
his face was perfectly expressionless his voice was deep and rough
he stood well back upon his legs and said  we ought to get them up to two thousand three hundred and fifty
a stableboy brought him a telegram and went away
he opened it negligently regarded it without emotion and in complete silence handed it to me
on the pinkish paper in a sprawled handwriting i read safe brindisi
having rattling good time
nancy
well edward was the english gentleman but he was also to the last a sentimentalist whose mind was compounded of indifferent poems and novels
he just looked up to the roof of the stable as if he were looking to heaven and whispered something that i did not catch
then he put two fingers into the waistcoat pocket of his grey frieze suit they came out with a little neat penknifequite a small penknife
he said to me  you might just take that wire to leonora
and he looked at me with a direct challenging browbeating glare
i guess he could see in my eyes that i didn't intend to hinder him
why should i hinder him
i didn't think he was wanted in the world let his confounded tenants his rifleassociations his drunkards reclaimed and unreclaimed get on as they liked
not all the hundreds and hundreds of them deserved that that poor devil should go on suffering for their sakes
when he saw that i did not intend to interfere with him his eyes became soft and almost affectionate
he remarked  so long old man i must have a bit of a rest you know
i didn't know what to say
i wanted to say god bless you for i also am a sentimentalist
but i thought that perhaps that would not be quite english good form so i trotted off with the telegram to leonora
she was quite pleased with it
