the end of the middle ages part one chapter i the bertolini the signora had no business to do it said miss bartlett no business at all
she promised us south rooms with a view close together instead of which here are north rooms looking into a courtyard and a long way apart
oh lucy and a cockney besides said lucy who had been further saddened by the signoras unexpected accent
it might be london she looked at the two rows of english people who were sitting at the table at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the english people at the portraits of the late queen and the late poet laureate that hung behind the english people heavily framed at the notice of the english church rev
cuthbert eager m a
oxon
that was the only other decoration of the wall
charlotte dont you feel too that we might be in london
i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside
i suppose it is ones being so tired this meat has surely been used for soup said miss bartlett laying down her fork
i want so to see the arno
the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno
the signora had no business to do it at all
oh it is a shame any nook does for me miss bartlett continued but it does seem hard that you shouldnt have a view lucy felt that she had been selfish
charlotte you mustnt spoil me of course you must look over the arno too
i meant that
the first vacant room in the front you must have it said miss bartlett part of whose travelling expenses were paid by lucys mothera piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion
no no
you must have it i insist on it
your mother would never forgive me lucy she would never forgive me the ladies voices grew animated andif the sad truth be owneda little peevish
they were tired and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled
some of their neighbours interchanged glances and one of themone of the illbred people whom one does meet abroadleant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument
he said i have a view i have a view miss bartlett was startled
generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking and often did not find out that they would do till they had gone
she knew that the intruder was illbred even before she glanced at him
he was an old man of heavy build with a fair shaven face and large eyes
there was something childish in those eyes though it was not the childishness of senility
what exactly it was miss bartlett did not stop to consider for her glance passed on to his clothes
these did not attract her
he was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim
so she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her and then said a view
oh a view
how delightful a view is this is my son said the old man his names george
he has a view too ah said miss bartlett repressing lucy who was about to speak
what i mean he continued is that you can have our rooms and well have yours
well change the better class of tourist was shocked at this and sympathized with the newcomers
miss bartlett in reply opened her mouth as little as possible and said thank you very much indeed that is out of the question why said the old man with both fists on the table
because it is quite out of the question thank you you see we dont like to take began lucy
her cousin again repressed her
but why he persisted
women like looking at a view men dont and he thumped with his fists like a naughty child and turned to his son saying george persuade them its so obvious they should have the rooms said the son
theres nothing else to say he did not look at the ladies as he spoke but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful
lucy too was perplexed but she saw that they were in for what is known as quite a scene and she had an odd feeling that whenever these illbred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt not with rooms and views but withwell with something quite different whose existence she had not realized before
now the old man attacked miss bartlett almost violently why should she not change
what possible objection had she
they would clear out in half an hour
miss bartlett though skilled in the delicacies of conversation was powerless in the presence of brutality
it was impossible to snub any one so gross
her face reddened with displeasure
she looked around as much as to say are you all like this and two little old ladies who were sitting further up the table with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs looked back clearly indicating we are not we are genteel eat your dinner dear she said to lucy and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured
lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite
eat your dinner dear
this pension is a failure
tomorrow we will make a change hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it
the curtains at the end of the room parted and revealed a clergyman stout but attractive who hurried forward to take his place at the table cheerfully apologizing for his lateness
lucy who had not yet acquired decency at once rose to her feet exclaiming oh oh
why its mr beebe
oh how perfectly lovely
oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are
oh miss bartlett said with more restraint how do you do mr beebe
i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peters that very cold easter the clergyman who had the air of one on a holiday did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him
but he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by lucy
i am so glad to see you said the girl who was in a state of spiritual starvation and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it
just fancy how small the world is
summer street too makes it so specially funny miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street said miss bartlett filling up the gap and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living yes i heard from mother so last week
she didnt know that i knew you at tunbridge wells but i wrote back at once and i said mr
beebe is quite right said the clergyman
i move into the rectory at summer street next june
i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood oh how glad i am
the name of our house is windy corner mr beebe bowed
there is mother and me generally and my brother though its not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner i am eating it thank you and enjoying it he preferred to talk to lucy whose playing he remembered rather than to miss bartlett who probably remembered his sermons
he asked the girl whether she knew florence well and was informed at some length that she had never been there before
it is delightful to advise a newcomer and he was first in the field
dont neglect the country round his advice concluded
the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort no cried a voice from the top of the table
mr
beebe you are wrong
the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato that lady looks so clever whispered miss bartlett to her cousin
we are in luck and indeed a perfect torrent of information burst on them
people told them what to see when to see it how to stop the electric trams how to get rid of the beggars how much to give for a vellum blotter how much the place would grow upon them
the pension bertolini had decided almost enthusiastically that they would do
whichever way they looked kind ladies smiled and shouted at them
and above all rose the voice of the clever lady crying prato
they must go to prato
that place is too sweetly squalid for words
i love it i revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know the young man named george glanced at the clever lady and then returned moodily to his plate
obviously he and his father did not do
lucy in the midst of her success found time to wish they did
it gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold and when she rose to go she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow
the father did not see it the son acknowledged it not by another bow but by raising his eyebrows and smiling he seemed to be smiling across something
she hastened after her cousin who had already disappeared through the curtainscurtains which smote one in the face and seemed heavy with more than cloth
beyond them stood the unreliable signora bowing goodevening to her guests and supported by enery her little boy and victorier her daughter
it made a curious little scene this attempt of the cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the south
and even more curious was the drawingroom which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a bloomsbury boardinghouse
was this really italy
miss bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed armchair which had the colour and the contours of a tomato
she was talking to mr beebe and as she spoke her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards slowly regularly as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle
we are most grateful to you she was saying
the first evening means so much
when you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart dheure he expressed his regret
do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner emerson is he a friend of yours we are friendlyas one is in pensions then i will say no more he pressed her very slightly and she said more
i am as it were she concluded the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing
his manner was somewhat unfortunate
i hope i acted for the best you acted very naturally said he
he seemed thoughtful and after a few moments added all the same i dont think much harm would have come of accepting no harm of course
but we could not be under an obligation he is rather a peculiar man again he hesitated and then said gently i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude
he has the meritif it is oneof saying exactly what he means
he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them
he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite
it is so difficultat least i find it difficultto understand people who speak the truth lucy was pleased and said i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice i think he is nice and tiresome
i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expecti may say i hopeyou will differ
but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores
when he first came here he not unnaturally put peoples backs up
he has no tact and no mannersi dont mean by that that he has bad mannersand he will not keep his opinions to himself
we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it am i to conclude said miss bartlett that he is a socialist mr beebe accepted the convenient word not without a slight twitching of the lips
and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too i hardly know george for he hasnt learnt to talk yet
he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains
of course he has all his fathers mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist oh you relieve me said miss bartlett
so you think i ought to have accepted their offer
you feel i have been narrowminded and suspicious not at all he answered i never suggested that but ought i not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness he replied with some irritation that it would be quite unnecessary and got up from his seat to go to the smokingroom
was i a bore said miss bartlett as soon as he had disappeared
why didnt you talk lucy
he prefers young people im sure
i do hope i havent monopolized him
i hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinnertime he is nice exclaimed lucy
just what i remember
he seems to see good in everyone
no one would take him for a clergyman my dear lucia well you know what i mean
and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man funny girl
how you do remind me of your mother
i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe im sure she will and so will freddy i think everyone at windy corner will approve it is the fashionable world
i am used to tunbridge wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times yes said lucy despondently
there was a haze of disapproval in the air but whether the disapproval was of herself or of mr beebe or of the fashionable world at windy corner or of the narrow world at tunbridge wells she could not determine
she tried to locate it but as usual she blundered
miss bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one and added i am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion and the girl again thought i must have been selfish or unkind i must be more careful
it is so dreadful for charlotte being poor fortunately one of the little old ladies who for some time had been smiling very benignly now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where mr beebe had sat
permission granted she began to chatter gently about italy the plunge it had been to come there the gratifying success of the plunge the improvement in her sisters health the necessity of closing the bedroom windows at night and of thoroughly emptying the waterbottles in the morning
she handled her subjects agreeably and they were perhaps more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon guelfs and ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room
it was a real catastrophe not a mere episode that evening of hers at venice when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea though one better than something else
but here you are as safe as in england
signora bertolini is so english yet our rooms smell said poor lucy
we dread going to bed ah then you look into the court she sighed
if only mr emerson was more tactful
we were so sorry for you at dinner i think he was meaning to be kind undoubtedly he was said miss bartlett
mr
beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature
of course i was holding back on my cousins account of course said the little old lady and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl
lucy tried to look demure but could not help feeling a great fool
no one was careful with her at home or at all events she had not noticed it
about old mr emersoni hardly know
no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same timebeautiful beautiful said miss bartlett puzzled at the word
are not beauty and delicacy the same so one would have thought said the other helplessly
but things are so difficult i sometimes think she proceeded no further into things for mr beebe reappeared looking extremely pleasant
miss bartlett he cried its all right about the rooms
im so glad
mr emerson was talking about it in the smokingroom and knowing what i did i encouraged him to make the offer again
he has let me come and ask you
he would be so pleased oh charlotte cried lucy to her cousin we must have the rooms now
the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be miss bartlett was silent
i fear said mr beebe after a pause that i have been officious
i must apologize for my interference gravely displeased he turned to go
not till then did miss bartlett reply my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours
it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness
if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it
would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally she raised her voice as she spoke it was heard all over the drawingroom and silenced the guelfs and the ghibellines
the clergyman inwardly cursing the female sex bowed and departed with her message
remember lucy i alone am implicated in this
i do not wish the acceptance to come from you
grant me that at all events mr beebe was back saying rather nervously mr
emerson is engaged but here is his son instead the young man gazed down on the three ladies who felt seated on the floor so low were their chairs
my father he said is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally
but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out miss bartlett was unequal to the bath
all her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first
young mr emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of mr beebe and to the secret delight of lucy
poor young man said miss bartlett as soon as he had gone
how angry he is with his father about the rooms
it is all he can do to keep polite in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready said mr beebe
then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins he retired to his own rooms to write up his philosophic diary
oh dear breathed the little old lady and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment
gentlemen sometimes do not realize her voice faded away but miss bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part
lucy not realizing either was reduced to literature
taking up baedekers handbook to northern italy she committed to memory the most important dates of florentine history
for she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow
thus the halfhour crept profitably away and at last miss bartlett rose with a sigh and said i think one might venture now
no lucy do not stir
i will superintend the move how you do do everything said lucy
naturally dear
it is my affair but i would like to help you no dear charlottes energy
and her unselfishness
she had been thus all her life but really on this italian tour she was surpassing herself
so lucy felt or strove to feel
and yetthere was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful
at all events she entered her own room without any feeling of joy
i want to explain said miss bartlett why it is that i have taken the largest room
naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it lucy was bewildered
if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him
i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to
however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this mother wouldnt mind im sure said lucy but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues
miss bartlett only sighed and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her goodnight
it gave lucy the sensation of a fog and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the arno and the cypresses of san miniato and the foothills of the apennines black against the rising moon
miss bartlett in her room fastened the windowshutters and locked the door and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances
it was then that she saw pinned up over the washstand a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation
nothing more
what does it mean she thought and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle
meaningless at first it gradually became menacing obnoxious portentous with evil
she was seized with an impulse to destroy it but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so since it must be the property of young mr emerson
so she unpinned it carefully and put it between two pieces of blottingpaper to keep it clean for him
then she completed her inspection of the room sighed heavily according to her habit and went to bed
chapter ii in santa croce with no baedeker it was pleasant to wake up in florence to open the eyes upon a bright bare room with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons
it was pleasant too to fling wide the windows pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite and close below the arno gurgling against the embankment of the road
over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore and on the river was a boat also diligently employed for some mysterious end
an electric tram came rushing underneath the window
no one was inside it except one tourist but its platforms were overflowing with italians who preferred to stand
children tried to hang on behind and the conductor with no malice spat in their faces to make them let go
then soldiers appearedgoodlooking undersized menwearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur and a greatcoat which had been cut for some larger soldier
beside them walked officers looking foolish and fierce and before them went little boys turning somersaults in time with the band
the tramcar became entangled in their ranks and moved on painfully like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants
one of the little boys fell down and some white bullocks came out of an archway
indeed if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling buttonhooks the road might never have got clear
over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away and the traveller who has gone to italy to study the tactile values of giotto or the corruption of the papacy may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it
so it was as well that miss bartlett should tap and come in and having commented on lucys leaving the door unlocked and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed should urge her to hasten herself or the best of the day would be gone
by the time lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs
a conversation then ensued on not unfamiliar lines
miss bartlett was after all a wee bit tired and thought they had better spend the morning settling in unless lucy would at all like to go out
lucy would rather like to go out as it was her first day in florence but of course she could go alone
miss bartlett could not allow this
of course she would accompany lucy everywhere
oh certainly not lucy would stop with her cousin
oh no
that would never do
oh yes
at this point the clever lady broke in
if it is mrs grundy who is troubling you i do assure you that you can neglect the good person
being english miss honeychurch will be perfectly safe
italians understand
a dear friend of mine contessa baroncelli has two daughters and when she cannot send a maid to school with them she lets them go in sailorhats instead
every one takes them for english you see especially if their hair is strained tightly behind miss bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of contessa baroncellis daughters
she was determined to take lucy herself her head not being so very bad
the clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in santa croce and if lucy would come too she would be delighted
i will take you by a dear dirty back way miss honeychurch and if you bring me luck we shall have an adventure lucy said that this was most kind and at once opened the baedeker to see where santa croce was
tut tut
miss lucy
i hope we shall soon emancipate you from baedeker
he does but touch the surface of things
as to the true italyhe does not even dream of it
the true italy is only to be found by patient observation this sounded very interesting and lucy hurried over her breakfast and started with her new friend in high spirits
italy was coming at last
the cockney signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream
miss lavishfor that was the clever ladys nameturned to the right along the sunny lung arno
how delightfully warm
but a wind down the side streets cut like a knife didnt it
ponte alle grazieparticularly interesting mentioned by dante
san miniatobeautiful as well as interesting the crucifix that kissed a murderermiss honeychurch would remember the story
the men on the river were fishing
untrue but then so is most information
then miss lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks and she stopped and she cried a smell
a true florentine smell
every city let me teach you has its own smell is it a very nice smell said lucy who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt
one doesnt come to italy for niceness was the retort one comes for life
buon giorno
buon giorno bowing right and left
look at that adorable winecart
how the driver stares at us dear simple soul so miss lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of florence short fidgety and playful as a kitten though without a kittens grace
it was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful and a blue military cloak such as an italian officer wears only increased the sense of festivity
buon giorno
take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors
that is the true democracy
though i am a real radical as well
there now youre shocked indeed im not exclaimed lucy
we are radicals too out and out
my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland i see i see
and now you have gone over to the enemy oh please
if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right
and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp shameful
a manufacturing district i suppose noin the surrey hills
about five miles from dorking looking over the weald miss lavish seemed interested and slackened her trot
what a delightful part i know it so well
it is full of the very nicest people
do you know sir harry otwaya radical if ever there was very well indeed and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist why she rents a field of us
how funny miss lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky and murmured oh you have property in surrey hardly any said lucy fearful of being thought a snob
only thirty acresjust the garden all downhill and some fields miss lavish was not disgusted and said it was just the size of her aunts suffolk estate
italy receded
they tried to remember the last name of lady louisa someone who had taken a house near summer street the other year but she had not liked it which was odd of her
and just as miss lavish had got the name she broke off and exclaimed bless us
bless us and save us
weve lost the way certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching santa croce the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window
but miss lavish had said so much about knowing her florence by heart that lucy had followed her with no misgivings
lost
lost
my dear miss lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning
how those horrid conservatives would jeer at us
what are we to do
two lone females in an unknown town
now this is what i call an adventure lucy who wanted to see santa croce suggested as a possible solution that they should ask the way there
oh but that is the word of a craven
and no you are not not not to look at your baedeker
give it to me i shant let you carry it
we will simply drift accordingly they drifted through a series of those greybrown streets neither commodious nor picturesque in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds
lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of lady louisa and became discontented herself
for one ravishing moment italy appeared
she stood in the square of the annunziata and saw in the living terracotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale
there they stood with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven
lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful but miss lavish with a shriek of dismay dragged her forward declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile
the hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins or rather ceases to tell and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop because it looked so typical
it tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped partly of hair oil partly of the great unknown
but it gave them strength to drift into another piazza large and dusty on the farther side of which rose a blackandwhite faade of surpassing ugliness
miss lavish spoke to it dramatically
it was santa croce
the adventure was over
stop a minute let those two people go on or i shall have to speak to them
i do detest conventional intercourse
nasty
they are going into the church too
oh the britisher abroad we sat opposite them at dinner last night
they have given us their rooms
they were so very kind look at their figures laughed miss lavish
they walk through my italy like a pair of cows
its very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldnt pass it what would you ask us miss lavish laid her hand pleasantly on lucys arm as if to suggest that she at all events would get full marks
in this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church and were about to enter it when miss lavish stopped squeaked flung up her arms and cried there goes my localcolour box
i must have a word with him and in a moment she was away over the piazza her military cloak flapping in the wind nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers and nipped him playfully upon the arm
lucy waited for nearly ten minutes
then she began to get tired
the beggars worried her the dust blew in her eyes and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places
she descended slowly into the piazza with the intention of rejoining miss lavish who was really almost too original
but at that moment miss lavish and her localcolour box moved also and disappeared down a side street both gesticulating largely
tears of indignation came to lucys eyes partly because miss lavish had jilted her partly because she had taken her baedeker
how could she find her way home
how could she find her way about in santa croce
her first morning was ruined and she might never be in florence again
a few minutes ago she had been all high spirits talking as a woman of culture and half persuading herself that she was full of originality
now she entered the church depressed and humiliated not even able to remember whether it was built by the franciscans or the dominicans
of course it must be a wonderful building
but how like a barn
and how very cold
of course it contained frescoes by giotto in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper
but who was to tell her which they were
she walked about disdainfully unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date
there was no one even to tell her which of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts was the one that was really beautiful the one that had been most praised by mr ruskin
then the pernicious charm of italy worked on her and instead of acquiring information she began to be happy
she puzzled out the italian noticesthe notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the churchthe notice that prayed people in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves not to spit
she watched the tourists their noses were as red as their baedekers so cold was santa croce
she beheld the horrible fate that overtook three papiststwo hebabies and a shebabywho began their career by sousing each other with the holy water and then proceeded to the machiavelli memorial dripping but hallowed
advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances they touched the stone with their fingers with their handkerchiefs with their heads and then retreated
what could this mean
they did it again and again
then lucy realized that they had mistaken machiavelli for some saint hoping to acquire virtue
punishment followed quickly
the smallest hebaby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by mr ruskin and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop
protestant as she was lucy darted forward
she was too late
he fell heavily upon the prelates upturned toes
hateful bishop exclaimed the voice of old mr emerson who had darted forward also
hard in life hard in death
go out into the sunshine little boy and kiss your hand to the sun for that is where you ought to be
intolerable bishop the child screamed frantically at these words and at these dreadful people who picked him up dusted him rubbed his bruises and told him not to be superstitious
look at him said mr emerson to lucy
heres a mess a baby hurt cold and frightened
but what else can you expect from a church the childs legs had become as melting wax
each time that old mr emerson and lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar
fortunately an italian lady who ought to have been saying her prayers came to the rescue
by some mysterious virtue which mothers alone possess she stiffened the little boys backbone and imparted strength to his knees
he stood
still gibbering with agitation he walked away
you are a clever woman said mr emerson
you have done more than all the relics in the world
i am not of your creed but i do believe in those who make their fellowcreatures happy
there is no scheme of the universe he paused for a phrase
niente said the italian lady and returned to her prayers
im not sure she understands english suggested lucy
in her chastened mood she no longer despised the emersons
she was determined to be gracious to them beautiful rather than delicate and if possible to erase miss bartletts civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms
that woman understands everything was mr emersons reply
but what are you doing here
are you doing the church
are you through with the church no cried lucy remembering her grievance
i came here with miss lavish who was to explain everything and just by the doorit is too badshe simply ran away and after waiting quite a time i had to come in by myself why shouldnt you said mr emerson
yes why shouldnt you come by yourself said the son addressing the young lady for the first time
but miss lavish has even taken away baedeker baedeker said mr emerson
im glad its that you minded
its worth minding the loss of a baedeker
thats worth minding lucy was puzzled
she was again conscious of some new idea and was not sure whither it would lead her
if youve no baedeker said the son youd better join us was this where the idea would lead
she took refuge in her dignity
thank you very much but i could not think of that
i hope you do not suppose that i came to join on to you
i really came to help with the child and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night
i hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience my dear said the old man gently i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say
you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really
stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see
to take you to it will be a real pleasure now this was abominably impertinent and she ought to have been furious
but it is sometimes as difficult to lose ones temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it
lucy could not get cross
mr emerson was an old man and surely a girl might humour him
on the other hand his son was a young man and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him or at all events be offended before him
it was at him that she gazed before replying
i am not touchy i hope
it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are the son nodded
with a look of sombre satisfaction he led the way to the peruzzi chapel
there was a hint of the teacher about him
she felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly
the chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer directing them how to worship giotto not by tactful valuations but by the standards of the spirit
remember he was saying the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared
observe how giotto in these frescoesnow unhappily ruined by restorationis untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective
could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true
how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels no exclaimed mr emerson in much too loud a voice for church
remember nothing of the sort
built by faith indeed
that simply means the workmen werent paid properly
and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them
look at that fat man in blue
he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon he was referring to the fresco of the ascension of st john inside the lecturers voice faltered as well it might
the audience shifted uneasily and so did lucy
she was sure that she ought not to be with these men but they had cast a spell over her
they were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave
now did this happen or didnt it
yes or no george replied it happened like this if it happened at all
i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here you will never go up said his father
you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up
it did happen like that if it happened at all pardon me said a frigid voice
the chapel is somewhat small for two parties
we will incommode you no longer the lecturer was a clergyman and his audience must be also his flock for they held prayerbooks as well as guidebooks in their hands
they filed out of the chapel in silence
amongst them were the two little old ladies of the pension bertolinimiss teresa and miss catherine alan
stop cried mr emerson
theres plenty of room for us all
stop the procession disappeared without a word
soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel describing the life of st francis
george i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate george went into the next chapel and returned saying perhaps he is
i dont remember then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am
its that mr
eager
why did he go
did we talk too loud
how vexatious
i shall go and say we are sorry
hadnt i better
then perhaps he will come back he will not come back said george
but mr emerson contrite and unhappy hurried away to apologize to the rev
cuthbert eager
lucy apparently absorbed in a lunette could hear the lecture again interrupted the anxious aggressive voice of the old man the curt injured replies of his opponent
the son who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy was listening also
my father has that effect on nearly everyone he informed her
he will try to be kind i hope we all try said she smiling nervously
because we think it improves our characters
but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened how silly of them said lucy though in her heart she sympathized i think that a kind action done tactfully tact he threw up his head in disdain
apparently she had given the wrong answer
she watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel
for a young man his face was rugged anduntil the shadows fell upon ithard
enshadowed it sprang into tenderness
she saw him once again at rome on the ceiling of the sistine chapel carrying a burden of acorns
healthy and muscular he yet gave her the feeling of greyness of tragedy that might only find solution in the night
the feeling soon passed it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle
born of silence and of unknown emotion it passed when mr emerson returned and she could reenter the world of rapid talk which was alone familiar to her
were you snubbed asked his son tranquilly
but we have spoilt the pleasure of i dont know how many people
they wont come back full of innate sympathyquickness to perceive good in othersvision of the brotherhood of man scraps of the lecture on st francis came floating round the partition wall
dont let us spoil yours he continued to lucy
have you looked at those saints yes said lucy
they are lovely
do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in ruskin he did not know and suggested that they should try to guess it
george rather to her relief refused to move and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about santa croce which though it is like a barn has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls
there were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars and an old lady with her dog and here and there a priest modestly edging to his mass through the groups of tourists
but mr emerson was only half interested
he watched the lecturer whose success he believed he had impaired and then he anxiously watched his son
why will he look at that fresco he said uneasily
i saw nothing in it i like giotto she replied
it is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values
though i like things like the della robbia babies better so you ought
a baby is worth a dozen saints
and my babys worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell lucy again felt that this did not do
in hell he repeated
hes unhappy oh dear said lucy
how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive
what more is one to give him
and think how he has been brought upfree from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god
with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy she was no theologian but she felt that here was a very foolish old man as well as a very irreligious one
she also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person and that charlotte would object most strongly
what are we to do with him he asked
he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaveslike that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone
eh
what did you say lucy had made no suggestion
suddenly he said now dont be stupid over this
i dont require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him
you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible
you might help me
he has known so few women and you have the time
you stop here several weeks i suppose
but let yourself go
you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night
let yourself go
pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them
by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself
it will be good for both of you to this extraordinary speech lucy found no answer
i only know what it is thats wrong with him not why it is and what is it asked lucy fearfully expecting some harrowing tale
the old trouble things wont fit what things the things of the universe
it is quite true
they dont oh mr emerson whatever do you mean in his ordinary voice so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry he said from far from eve and morning and yon twelvewinded sky the stuff of life to knit me blew hither here am i george and i both know this but why does it distress him
we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness
but why should this make us unhappy
let us rather love one another and work and rejoice
i dont believe in this world sorrow miss honeychurch assented
then make my boy think like us
make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yesa transitory yes if you like but a yes suddenly she laughed surely one ought to laugh
a young man melancholy because the universe wouldnt fit because life was a tangle or a wind or a yes or something
im very sorry she cried
youll think me unfeeling butbut then she became matronly
oh but your son wants employment
has he no particular hobby
why i myself have worries but i can generally forget them at the piano and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother
perhaps italy bores him you ought to try the alps or the lakes the old mans face saddened and he touched her gently with his hand
this did not alarm her she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it
indeed he no longer alarmed her at all she regarded him as a kind thing but quite silly
her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically before she lost baedeker
the dear george now striding towards them over the tombstones seemed both pitiable and absurd
he approached his face in the shadow
he said miss bartlett oh good gracious me said lucy suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective
where
where in the nave i see
those gossiping little miss alans must have she checked herself
poor girl exploded mr emerson
poor girl she could not let this pass for it was just what she was feeling herself
poor girl
i fail to understand the point of that remark
i think myself a very fortunate girl i assure you
im thoroughly happy and having a splendid time
pray dont waste time mourning over me
theres enough sorrow in the world isnt there without trying to invent it
goodbye
thank you both so much for all your kindness
ah yes
there does come my cousin
a delightful morning
santa croce is a wonderful church she joined her cousin
chapter iii music violets and the letter s it so happened that lucy who found daily life rather chaotic entered a more solid world when she opened the piano
she was then no longer either deferential or patronizing no longer either a rebel or a slave
the kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected
the commonplace person begins to play and shoots into the empyrean without effort whilst we look up marvelling how he has escaped us and thinking how we could worship him and love him would he but translate his visions into human words and his experiences into human actions
perhaps he cannot certainly he does not or does so very seldom
lucy had done so never
she was no dazzling excutante her runs were not at all like strings of pearls and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation
nor was she the passionate young lady who performs so tragically on a summers evening with the window open
passion was there but it could not be easily labelled it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy and all the furniture of the pictorial style
and she was tragical only in the sense that she was great for she loved to play on the side of victory
victory of what and over whatthat is more than the words of daily life can tell us
but that some sonatas of beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides and lucy had decided that they should triumph
a very wet afternoon at the bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked and after lunch she opened the little draped piano
a few people lingered round and praised her playing but finding that she made no reply dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep
she took no notice of mr emerson looking for his son nor of miss bartlett looking for miss lavish nor of miss lavish looking for her cigarettecase
like every true performer she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes they were fingers caressing her own and by touch not by sound alone did she come to her desire
mr beebe sitting unnoticed in the window pondered this illogical element in miss honeychurch and recalled the occasion at tunbridge wells when he had discovered it
it was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower
the seats were filled with a respectful audience and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish under the auspices of their vicar sang or recited or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork
among the promised items was miss honeychurch
piano
beethoven and mr beebe was wondering whether it would be adelaida or the march of the ruins of athens when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of opus iii
he was in suspense all through the introduction for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends
with the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory
he was glad that she only played the first movement for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of ninesixteen
the audience clapped no less respectful
it was mr beebe who started the stamping it was all that one could do
who is she he asked the vicar afterwards
cousin of one of my parishioners
i do not consider her choice of a piece happy
beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs introduce me she will be delighted
she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon my sermon cried mr beebe
why ever did she listen to it when he was introduced he understood why for miss honeychurch disjoined from her music stool was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty pale undeveloped face
she loved going to concerts she loved stopping with her cousin she loved iced coffee and meringues
he did not doubt that she loved his sermon also
but before he left tunbridge wells he made a remark to the vicar which he now made to lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him if miss honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays it will be very exciting both for us and for her lucy at once reentered daily life
oh what a funny thing
some one said just the same to mother and she said she trusted i should never live a duet doesnt mrs honeychurch like music she doesnt mind it
but she doesnt like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it
she thinksi cant make out
once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any ones
she has never got over it
of course i didnt mean that i played well i only meant of course said he wondering why she bothered to explain
music said lucy as if attempting some generality
she could not complete it and looked out absently upon italy in the wet
the whole life of the south was disorganized and the most graceful nation in europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes
the street and the river were dirty yellow the bridge was dirty grey and the hills were dirty purple
somewhere in their folds were concealed miss lavish and miss bartlett who had chosen this afternoon to visit the torre del gallo
what about music said mr beebe
poor charlotte will be sopped was lucys reply
the expedition was typical of miss bartlett who would return cold tired hungry and angelic with a ruined skirt a pulpy baedeker and a tickling cough in her throat
on another day when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth like wine she would refuse to stir from the drawingroom saying that she was an old thing and no fit companion for a hearty girl
miss lavish has led your cousin astray
she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe miss lavish is so original murmured lucy
this was a stock remark the supreme achievement of the pension bertolini in the way of definition
miss lavish was so original
mr beebe had his doubts but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness
for that and for other reasons he held his peace
is it true continued lucy in awestruck tone that miss lavish is writing a book they do say so what is it about it will be a novel replied mr beebe dealing with modern italy
let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know i wish miss lavish would tell me herself
we started such friends
but i dont think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce
charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldnt help being a little annoyed with miss lavish the two ladies at all events have made it up he was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as miss bartlett and miss lavish
they were always in each others company with lucy a slighted third
miss lavish he believed he understood but miss bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness though not perhaps of meaning
was italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon which he had assigned to her at tunbridge wells
all his life he had loved to study maiden ladies they were his specialty and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work
girls like lucy were charming to look at but mr beebe was from rather profound reasons somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled
lucy for the third time said that poor charlotte would be sopped
the arno was rising in flood washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore
but in the southwest there had appeared a dull haze of yellow which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse
she opened the window to inspect and a cold blast entered the room drawing a plaintive cry from miss catharine alan who entered at the same moment by the door
oh dear miss honeychurch you will catch a chill
and mr beebe here besides
who would suppose this is italy
there is my sister actually nursing the hotwater can no comforts or proper provisions she sidled towards them and sat down selfconscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man or a man and one woman
i could hear your beautiful playing miss honeychurch though i was in my room with the door shut
doors shut indeed most necessary
no one has the least idea of privacy in this country
and one person catches it from another lucy answered suitably
mr beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at modena where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath exclaiming cheerfully fa niente sono vecchia he contented himself with saying i quite agree with you miss alan
the italians are a most unpleasant people
they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves
we are at their mercy
they read our thoughts they foretell our desires
from the cabdriver down toto giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it
yet in their heart of hearts they arehow superficial
they have no conception of the intellectual life
how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day ho mr beebe if you knew what i suffer over the childrens edjucaishion
hi wont ave my little victorier taught by a hignorant italian what cant explain nothink miss alan did not follow but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way
her sister was a little disappointed in mr beebe having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers
indeed who would have supposed that tolerance sympathy and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form
in the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle and at last the cause was disclosed
from the chair beneath her she extracted a gunmetal cigarettecase on which were powdered in turquoise the initials e
l that belongs to lavish said the clergyman
a good fellow lavish but i wish shed start a pipe oh mr beebe said miss alan divided between awe and mirth
indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose
she took to it practically in despair after her lifes work was carried away in a landslip
surely that makes it more excusable what was that asked lucy
mr beebe sat back complacently and miss alan began as follows it was a noveland i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel
it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do
anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink
she said can i have a little ink please but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written
the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes
it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel
she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colourthis novel is to be about modern italy the other was historicalbut that she could not start till she had an idea
first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came herethis must on no account get round
and so cheerful through it all
i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them miss alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement
a delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks giving them unexpected beauty just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring
she felt she had made almost too many allowances and apologized hurriedly for her toleration
all the same she is a little tooi hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived mr beebe smiled as miss alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman
i dont know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade
that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely her jaw dropped
she was silent
mr beebe whose social resources were endless went out to order some tea and she continued to lucy in a hasty whisper stomach
he warned miss pole of her stomachacidity he called itand he may have meant to be kind
i must say i forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden
as teresa truly said it was no laughing matter
but the point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning s and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought
she thought they were commercial travellersdrummers was the word she usedand all through dinner she tried to prove that england our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce
teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so there miss lavish is one who can confute you better than i and pointed to that beautiful picture of lord tennyson
then miss lavish said tut
the early victorians just imagine
tut
the early victorians my sister had gone and i felt bound to speak
i said miss lavish i am an early victorian at least that is to say i will hear no breath of censure against our dear queen it was horrible speaking
i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did not want to go and i must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply
but unluckily mr emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice quite so quite so
i honour the woman for her irish visit the woman
i tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of s having been mentioned in the first place
but that was not all
after dinner miss lavish actually came up and said miss alan i am going into the smokingroom to talk to those two nice men
come too needless to say i refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all university men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers let me finish the story said mr beebe who had returned
miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said i shall go alone she went
at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience whatever happened cried lucy
no one knows
no one will ever know
miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling mr
beebeold mr emerson is he nice or not nice
i do so want to know mr beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself
no but it is so difficult
sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him
miss alan what do you think
is he nice the little old lady shook her head and sighed disapprovingly
mr beebe whom the conversation amused stirred her up by saying i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets violets
oh dear
who told you about the violets
how do things get round
a pension is a bad place for gossips
no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eagers lecture at santa croce
oh poor miss honeychurch
it really was too bad
no i have quite changed
i do not like the emersons
they are not nice mr beebe smiled nonchalantly
he had made a gentle effort to introduce the emersons into bertolini society and the effort had failed
he was almost the only person who remained friendly to them
miss lavish who represented intellect was avowedly hostile and now the miss alans who stood for good breeding were following her
miss bartlett smarting under an obligation would scarcely be civil
the case of lucy was different
she had given him a hazy account of her adventures in santa croce and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her to show her the world from their own strange standpoint to interest her in their private sorrows and joys
this was impertinent he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl he would rather it should fail
after all he knew nothing about them and pension joys pension sorrows are flimsy things whereas lucy would be his parishioner
lucy with one eye upon the weather finally said that she thought the emersons were nice not that she saw anything of them now
even their seats at dinner had been moved
but arent they always waylaying you to go out with them dear said the little lady inquisitively
only once
charlotte didnt like it and said somethingquite politely of course most right of her
they dont understand our ways
they must find their level mr beebe rather felt that they had gone under
they had given up their attemptif it was oneto conquer society and now the father was almost as silent as the son
he wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they leftsome expedition perhaps with lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them
it was one of mr beebes chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories
evening approached while they chatted the air became brighter the colours on the trees and hills were purified and the arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle
there were a few streaks of bluishgreen among the clouds a few patches of watery light upon the earth and then the dripping faade of san miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun
too late to go out said miss alan in a voice of relief
all the galleries are shut i think i shall go out said lucy
i want to go round the town in the circular tramon the platform by the driver her two companions looked grave
mr beebe who felt responsible for her in the absence of miss bartlett ventured to say i wish we could
unluckily i have letters
if you do want to go out alone wont you be better on your feet italians dear you know said miss alan
perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through but they still looked disapproval and she so far conceded to mr beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk and keep to the street frequented by tourists
she oughtnt really to go at all said mr beebe as they watched her from the window and she knows it
i put it down to too much beethoven chapter iv fourth chapter mr beebe was right
lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music
she had not really appreciated the clergymans wit nor the suggestive twitterings of miss alan
conversation was tedious she wanted something big and she believed that it would have come to her on the windswept platform of an electric tram
this she might not attempt
it was unladylike
why
why were most big things unladylike
charlotte had once explained to her why
it was not that ladies were inferior to men it was that they were different
their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves
indirectly by means of tact and a spotless name a lady could accomplish much
but if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured then despised and finally ignored
poems had been written to illustrate this point
there is much that is immortal in this medieval lady
the dragons have gone and so have the knights but still she lingers in our midst
she reigned in many an early victorian castle and was queen of much early victorian song
it is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well
but alas
the creature grows degenerate
in her heart also there are springing up strange desires
she too is enamoured of heavy winds and vast panoramas and green expanses of the sea
she has marked the kingdom of this world how full it is of wealth and beauty and wara radiant crust built around the central fires spinning towards the receding heavens
men declaring that she inspires them to it move joyfully over the surface having the most delightful meetings with other men happy not because they are masculine but because they are alive
before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the eternal woman and go there as her transitory self
lucy does not stand for the medieval lady who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious
nor has she any system of revolt
here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly and she would transgress it and perhaps be sorry that she had done so
this afternoon she was peculiarly restive
she would really like to do something of which her wellwishers disapproved
as she might not go on the electric tram she went to alinaris shop
there she bought a photograph of botticellis birth of venus venus being a pity spoilt the picture otherwise so charming and miss bartlett had persuaded her to do without it
a pity in art of course signified the nude
giorgiones tempesta the idolino some of the sistine frescoes and the apoxyomenos were added to it
she felt a little calmer then and bought fra angelicos coronation giottos ascension of st john some della robbia babies and some guido reni madonnas
for her taste was catholic and she extended uncritical approval to every wellknown name
but though she spent nearly seven lire the gates of liberty seemed still unopened
she was conscious of her discontent it was new to her to be conscious of it
the world she thought is certainly full of beautiful things if only i could come across them it was not surprising that mrs honeychurch disapproved of music declaring that it always left her daughter peevish unpractical and touchy
nothing ever happens to me she reflected as she entered the piazza signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels now fairly familiar to her
the great square was in shadow the sunshine had come too late to strike it
neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight half god half ghost and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge
the loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave wherein many a deity shadowy but immortal looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind
it was the hour of unrealitythe hour that is when unfamiliar things are real
an older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him and rest content
lucy desired more
she fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold
it seemed no longer a tower no longer supported by earth but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky
its brightness mesmerized her still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home
then something did happen
two italians by the loggia had been bickering about a debt
cinque lire they had cried cinque lire they sparred at each other and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest
he frowned he bent towards lucy with a look of interest as if he had an important message for her
he opened his lips to deliver it and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin
that was all
a crowd rose out of the dusk
it hid this extraordinary man from her and bore him away to the fountain
mr george emerson happened to be a few paces away looking at her across the spot where the man had been
how very odd
across something
even as she caught sight of him he grew dim the palace itself grew dim swayed above her fell on to her softly slowly noiselessly and the sky fell with it
she thought oh what have i done oh what have i done she murmured and opened her eyes
george emerson still looked at her but not across anything
she had complained of dullness and lo
one man was stabbed and another held her in his arms
they were sitting on some steps in the uffizi arcade
he must have carried her
he rose when she spoke and began to dust his knees
she repeated oh what have i done you fainted ii am very sorry how are you now perfectly wellabsolutely well and she began to nod and smile
then let us come home
theres no point in our stopping he held out his hand to pull her up
she pretended not to see it
the cries from the fountainthey had never ceasedrang emptily
the whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning
how very kind you have been
i might have hurt myself falling
but now i am well
i can go alone thank you his hand was still extended
oh my photographs she exclaimed suddenly
what photographs i bought some photographs at alinaris
i must have dropped them out there in the square she looked at him cautiously
would you add to your kindness by fetching them he added to his kindness
as soon as he had turned his back lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the arno
miss honeychurch she stopped with her hand on her heart
you sit still you arent fit to go home alone yes i am thank you so very much no you arent
youd go openly if you were but i had rather then i dont fetch your photographs i had rather be alone he said imperiously the man is deadthe man is probably dead sit down till you are rested she was bewildered and obeyed him
and dont move till i come back in the distance she saw creatures with black hoods such as appear in dreams
the palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day and joined itself to earth
how should she talk to mr emerson when he returned from the shadowy square
again the thought occurred to her oh what have i donethe thought that she as well as the dying man had crossed some spiritual boundary
he returned and she talked of the murder
oddly enough it was an easy topic
she spoke of the italian character she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before
being strong physically she soon overcame the horror of blood
she rose without his assistance and though wings seemed to flutter inside her she walked firmly enough towards the arno
there a cabman signalled to them they refused him
and the murderer tried to kiss him you sayhow very odd italians areand gave himself up to the police
mr beebe was saying that italians know everything but i think they are rather childish
when my cousin and i were at the pitti yesterdaywhat was that he had thrown something into the stream
what did you throw in things i didnt want he said crossly
mr
emerson well where are the photographs he was silent
i believe it was my photographs that you threw away i didnt know what to do with them he cried and his voice was that of an anxious boy
her heart warmed towards him for the first time
they were covered with blood
there
im glad ive told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them he pointed downstream
theyve gone the river swirled under the bridge i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the seai dont know i may just mean that they frightened me then the boy verged into a man
for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled
it isnt exactly that a man has died something warned lucy that she must stop him
it has happened he repeated and i mean to find out what it is mr
emerson he turned towards her frowning as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest
i want to ask you something before we go in they were close to their pension
she stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment
he did likewise
there is at times a magic in identity of position it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship
she moved her elbows before saying i have behaved ridiculously he was following his own thoughts
i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me i nearly fainted myself he said but she felt that her attitude repelled him
well i owe you a thousand apologies oh all right andthis is the real pointyou know how silly people are gossipingladies especially i am afraidyou understand what i mean im afraid i dont i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour your behaviour
oh yes all rightall right thank you so much
and would you she could not carry her request any further
the river was rushing below them almost black in the advancing night
he had thrown her photographs into it and then he had told her the reason
it struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man
he would do her no harm by idle gossip he was trustworthy intelligent and even kind he might even have a high opinion of her
but he lacked chivalry his thoughts like his behaviour would not be modified by awe
it was useless to say to him and would you and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture
she had been in his arms and he remembered it just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in alinaris shop
it was not exactly that a man had died something had happened to the living they had come to a situation where character tells and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of youth
well thank you so much she repeated how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life i dont anxiety moved her to question him
his answer was puzzling i shall probably want to live but why mr emerson
what do you mean i shall want to live i say leaning her elbows on the parapet she contemplated the river arno whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears
chapter v possibilities of a pleasant outing it was a family saying that you never knew which way charlotte bartlett would turn she was perfectly pleasant and sensible over lucys adventure found the abridged account of it quite adequate and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of mr george emerson
she and miss lavish had had an adventure also
they had been stopped at the dazio coming back and the young officials there who seemed impudent and dsuvr had tried to search their reticules for provisions
it might have been most unpleasant
fortunately miss lavish was a match for any one
for good or for evil lucy was left to face her problem alone
none of her friends had seen her either in the piazza or later on by the embankment
mr beebe indeed noticing her startled eyes at dinnertime had again passed to himself the remark of too much beethoven but he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure not that she had encountered it
this solitude oppressed her she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or at all events contradicted it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong
at breakfast next morning she took decisive action
there were two plans between which she had to choose
mr beebe was walking up to the torre del gallo with the emersons and some american ladies
would miss bartlett and miss honeychurch join the party
charlotte declined for herself she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon
but she thought it an admirable idea for lucy who hated shopping changing money fetching letters and other irksome dutiesall of which miss bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone
no charlotte cried the girl with real warmth
its very kind of mr beebe but i am certainly coming with you
i had much rather very well dear said miss bartlett with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of lucy
how abominably she behaved to charlotte now as always
but now she should alter
all morning she would be really nice to her
she slipped her arm into her cousins and they started off along the lung arno
the river was a lion that morning in strength voice and colour
miss bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it
she then made her usual remark which was how i do wish freddy and your mother could see this too lucy fidgeted it was tiresome of charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did
look lucia
oh you are watching for the torre del gallo party
i feared you would repent you of your choice serious as the choice had been lucy did not repent
yesterday had been a muddlequeer and odd the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paperbut she had a feeling that charlotte and her shopping were preferable to george emerson and the summit of the torre del gallo
since she could not unravel the tangle she must take care not to reenter it
she could protest sincerely against miss bartletts insinuations
but though she had avoided the chief actor the scenery unfortunately remained
charlotte with the complacency of fate led her from the river to the piazza signoria
she could not have believed that stones a loggia a fountain a palace tower would have such significance
for a moment she understood the nature of ghosts
the exact site of the murder was occupied not by a ghost but by miss lavish who had the morning newspaper in her hand
she hailed them briskly
the dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book
oh let me congratulate you said miss bartlett
after your despair of yesterday
what a fortunate thing aha
miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck
now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning lucy poked at the ground with her parasol
but perhaps you would rather not im sorryif you could manage without it i think i would rather not the elder ladies exchanged glances not of disapproval it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply
it is i who am sorry said miss lavish literary hacks are shameless creatures
i believe theres no secret of the human heart into which we wouldnt pry she marched cheerfully to the fountain and back and did a few calculations in realism
then she said that she had been in the piazza since eight oclock collecting material
a good deal of it was unsuitable but of course one always had to adapt
the two men had quarrelled over a fivefranc note
for the fivefranc note she should substitute a young lady which would raise the tone of the tragedy and at the same time furnish an excellent plot
what is the heroines name asked miss bartlett
leonora said miss lavish her own name was eleanor
i do hope shes nice that desideratum would not be omitted
and what is the plot love murder abduction revenge was the plot
but it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun
i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this miss lavish concluded
it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people
of course this is the barest outline
there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters
and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist oh you wicked woman cried miss bartlett
i am sure you are thinking of the emersons miss lavish gave a machiavellian smile
i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen
it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can
for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterdays is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life there was a fitting silence when miss lavish had concluded
then the cousins wished success to her labours and walked slowly away across the square
she is my idea of a really clever woman said miss bartlett
that last remark struck me as so particularly true
it should be a most pathetic novel lucy assented
at present her great aim was not to get put into it
her perceptions this morning were curiously keen and she believed that miss lavish had her on trial for an ingenu
she is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word continued miss bartlett slowly
none but the superficial would be shocked at her
we had a long talk yesterday
she believes in justice and truth and human interest
she told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of womanmr
eager
why how nice
what a pleasant surprise ah not for me said the chaplain blandly for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time we were chatting to miss lavish his brow contracted
so i saw
were you indeed
andate via
sono occupato the last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile
i am about to venture a suggestion
would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this weeka drive in the hills
we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano
there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hours ramble on the hillside
the view thence of florence is most beautifulfar better than the hackneyed view of fiesole
it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures
that man had a decided feeling for landscape
decidedly
but who looks at it today
ah the world is too much for us miss bartlett had not heard of alessio baldovinetti but she knew that mr
eager was no commonplace chaplain
he was a member of the residential colony who had made florence their home
he knew the people who never walked about with baedekers who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them
living in delicate seclusion some in furnished flats others in renaissance villas on fiesoles slope they read wrote studied and exchanged ideas thus attaining to that intimate knowledge or rather perception of florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of cook
therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of
between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent
tea at a renaissance villa
nothing had been said about it yet
but if it did come to thathow lucy would enjoy it
a few days ago and lucy would have felt the same
but the joys of life were grouping themselves anew
a drive in the hills with mr
eager and miss bartletteven if culminating in a residential teapartywas no longer the greatest of them
she echoed the raptures of charlotte somewhat faintly
only when she heard that mr beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere
so we shall be a partie carre said the chaplain
in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity
andate via
andate presto presto
ah the town
beautiful as it is it is the town they assented
this very squareso i am toldwitnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies
to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecrationportentous and humiliating humiliating indeed said miss bartlett
miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened
she can hardly bear to speak of it she glanced at lucy proudly
and how came we to have you here asked the chaplain paternally
miss bartletts recent liberalism oozed away at the question
do not blame her please mr
eager
the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned so you were here alone miss honeychurch his voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable
his dark handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply
practically one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home said miss bartlett adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver
for her also it must have been a terrible experience
i trust that neither of you was at allthat it was not in your immediate proximity of the many things lucy was noticing today not the least remarkable was this the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood
george emerson had kept the subject strangely pure
he died by the fountain i believe was her reply
and you and your friend were over at the loggia that must have saved you much
you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter pressthis man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views surely the vendor of photographs was in league with lucyin the eternal league of italy with youth
he had suddenly extended his book before miss bartlett and mr
eager binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches pictures and views
this is too much cried the chaplain striking petulantly at one of fra angelicos angels
she tore
a shrill cry rose from the vendor
the book it seemed was more valuable than one would have supposed
willingly would i purchase began miss bartlett
ignore him said mr
eager sharply and they all walked rapidly away from the square
but an italian can never be ignored least of all when he has a grievance
his mysterious persecution of mr
eager became relentless the air rang with his threats and lamentations
he appealed to lucy would not she intercede
he was poorhe sheltered a familythe tax on bread
he waited he gibbered he was recompensed he was dissatisfied he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant
shopping was the topic that now ensued
under the chaplains guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoesflorid little pictureframes that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry other little frames more severe that stood on little easels and were carven out of oak a blotting book of vellum a dante of the same material cheap mosaic brooches which the maids next christmas would never tell from real pins pots heraldic saucers brown artphotographs eros and psyche in alabaster st peter to matchall of which would have cost less in london
this successful morning left no pleasant impressions on lucy
she had been a little frightened both by miss lavish and by mr
eager she knew not why
and as they frightened her she had strangely enough ceased to respect them
she doubted that miss lavish was a great artist
she doubted that mr
eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose
they were tried by some new test and they were found wanting
as for charlotteas for charlotte she was exactly the same
it might be possible to be nice to her it was impossible to love her
the son of a labourer i happen to know it for a fact
a mechanic of some sort himself when he was young then he took to writing for the socialistic press
i came across him at brixton they were talking about the emersons
how wonderfully people rise in these days sighed miss bartlett fingering a model of the leaning tower of pisa
generally replied mr
eager one has only sympathy for their success
the desire for education and for social advancein these things there is something not wholly vile
there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florencelittle as they would make of it is he a journalist now miss bartlett asked
he is not he made an advantageous marriage he uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning and ended with a sigh
oh so he has a wife dead miss bartlett dead
i wonderyes i wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me
he was in my london parish long ago
the other day in santa croce when he was with miss honeychurch i snubbed him
let him beware that he does not get more than a snub what cried lucy flushing
exposure hissed mr
eager
he tried to change the subject but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended
miss bartlett was full of very natural curiosity
lucy though she wished never to see the emersons again was not disposed to condemn them on a single word
do you mean she asked that he is an irreligious man
we know that already lucy dear said miss bartlett gently reproving her cousins penetration
i should be astonished if you knew all
the boyan innocent child at the timei will exclude
god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him perhaps said miss bartlett it is something that we had better not hear to speak plainly said mr
eager it is
i will say no more for the first time lucys rebellious thoughts swept out in wordsfor the first time in her life
you have said very little it was my intention to say very little was his frigid reply
he gazed indignantly at the girl who met him with equal indignation
she turned towards him from the shop counter her breast heaved quickly
he observed her brow and the sudden strength of her lips
it was intolerable that she should disbelieve him
murder if you want to know he cried angrily
that man murdered his wife how she retorted
to all intents and purposes he murdered her
that day in santa crocedid they say anything against me not a word mr eagernot a single word oh i thought they had been libelling me to you
but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them im not defending them said lucy losing her courage and relapsing into the old chaotic methods
theyre nothing to me how could you think she was defending them said miss bartlett much discomfited by the unpleasant scene
the shopman was possibly listening
she will find it difficult
for that man has murdered his wife in the sight of god the addition of god was striking
but the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark
a silence followed which might have been impressive but was merely awkward
then miss bartlett hastily purchased the leaning tower and led the way into the street
i must be going said he shutting his eyes and taking out his watch
miss bartlett thanked him for his kindness and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive
drive
oh is our drive to come off lucy was recalled to her manners and after a little exertion the complacency of mr
eager was restored
bother the drive exclaimed the girl as soon as he had departed
it is just the drive we had arranged with mr beebe without any fuss at all
why should he invite us in that absurd manner
we might as well invite him
we are each paying for ourselves miss bartlett who had intended to lament over the emersons was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts
if that is so dearif the drive we and mr beebe are going with mr
eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr beebe then i foresee a sad kettle of fish how because mr beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come too that will mean another carriage far worse
mr
eager does not like eleanor
she knows it herself
the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him they were now in the newspaperroom at the english bank
lucy stood by the central table heedless of punch and the graphic trying to answer or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain
the wellknown world had broken up and there emerged florence a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things
murder accusations of murder a lady clinging to one man and being rude to anotherwere these the daily incidents of her streets
was there more in her frank beauty than met the eyethe power perhaps to evoke passions good and bad and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment
happy charlotte who though greatly troubled over things that did not matter seemed oblivious to things that did who could conjecture with admirable delicacy where things might lead to but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it
now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nosebag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck
she had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in italy it must only be broached within the walls of the english bank
as she groped she murmured whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr
eager or mr
eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogetherwhich they could scarcely dobut in any case we must be prepared
it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances
you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind
a onehorse carriage would do for us
yet how difficult it is it is indeed replied the girl with a gravity that sounded sympathetic
what do you think about it asked miss bartlett flushed from the struggle and buttoning up her dress
i dont know what i think nor what i want oh dear lucy
i do hope florence isnt boring you
speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth tomorrow thank you charlotte said lucy and pondered over the offer
there were letters for her at the bureauone from her brother full of athletics and biology one from her mother delightful as only her mothers letters could be
she had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce of the new parlourmaid who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade of the semidetached cottages which were ruining summer street and breaking the heart of sir harry otway
she recalled the free pleasant life of her home where she was allowed to do everything and where nothing ever happened to her
the road up through the pinewoods the clean drawingroom the view over the sussex wealdall hung before her bright and distinct but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which after much experience a traveller returns
and the news asked miss bartlett
mrs
vyse and her son have gone to rome said lucy giving the news that interested her least
do you know the vyses oh not that way back
we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria theyre nice people the vyses
so clevermy idea of whats really clever
dont you long to be in rome i die for it the piazza signoria is too stony to be brilliant
it has no grass no flowers no frescoes no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick
by an odd chanceunless we believe in a presiding genius of placesthe statues that relieve its severity suggest not the innocence of childhood nor the glorious bewilderment of youth but the conscious achievements of maturity
perseus and judith hercules and thusnelda they have done or suffered something and though they are immortal immortality has come to them after experience not before
here not only in the solitude of nature might a hero meet a goddess or a heroine a god
charlotte cried the girl suddenly
heres an idea
what if we popped off to rome tomorrowstraight to the vyses hotel
for i do know what i want
im sick of florence
no you said youd go to the ends of the earth
do
do miss bartlett with equal vivacity replied oh you droll person
pray what would become of your drive in the hills they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square laughing over the unpractical suggestion
chapter vi the reverend arthur beebe the reverend cuthbert eager mr emerson mr george emerson miss eleanor lavish miss charlotte bartlett and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a view italians drive them
it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day a youth all irresponsibility and fire recklessly urging his masters horses up the stony hill
mr beebe recognized him at once
neither the ages of faith nor the age of doubt had touched him he was phaethon in tuscany driving a cab
and it was persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way saying that she was his sisterpersephone tall and slender and pale returning with the spring to her mothers cottage and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light
to her mr
eager objected saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge and one must guard against imposition
but the ladies interceded and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god
phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist
she did not mind
mr
eager who sat with his back to the horses saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding and continued his conversation with lucy
the other two occupants of the carriage were old mr emerson and miss lavish
for a dreadful thing had happened mr beebe without consulting mr
eager had doubled the size of the party
and though miss bartlett and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads and miss lavish got in with lucy while miss bartlett with george emerson and mr beebe followed on behind
it was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carre thus transformed
tea at a renaissance villa if he had ever meditated it was now impossible
lucy and miss bartlett had a certain style about them and mr beebe though unreliable was a man of parts
but a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of godthey should enter no villa at his introduction
lucy elegantly dressed in white sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients attentive to mr
eager repressive towards miss lavish watchful of old mr emerson hitherto fortunately asleep thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of spring
she looked on the expedition as the work of fate
but for it she would have avoided george emerson successfully
in an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy
she had refused not because she disliked him but because she did not know what had happened and suspected that he did know
and this frightened her
for the real eventwhatever it washad taken place not in the loggia but by the river
to behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable
but to discuss it afterwards to pass from discussion into silence and through silence into sympathy that is an error not of a startled emotion but of the whole fabric
there was really something blameworthy she thought in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word
this sense of wickedness had been slight at first
she had nearly joined the party to the torre del gallo
but each time that she avoided george it became more imperative that she should avoid him again
and now celestial irony working through her cousin and two clergymen did not suffer her to leave florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills
meanwhile mr
eager held her in civil converse their little tiff was over
so miss honeychurch you are travelling
as a student of art oh dear me nooh no perhaps as a student of human nature interposed miss lavish like myself oh no
i am here as a tourist oh indeed said mr
eager
are you indeed
if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a littlehanded about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else
the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl
you know the american girl in punch who says say poppa what did we see at rome and the father replies why guess rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog theres travelling for you
ha
ha
ha i quite agree said miss lavish who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit
the narrowness and superficiality of the anglosaxon tourist is nothing less than a menace quite so
now the english colony at florence miss honeychurchand it is of considerable size though of course not all equallya few are here for trade for example
but the greater part are students
lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico
i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left
no you can only see it if you standno do not stand you will fall
she is very proud of that thick hedge
inside perfect seclusion
one might have gone back six hundred years
some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not it does indeed cried miss lavish
tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day but mr
eager proceeded to tell miss honeychurch that on the right lived mr
someone something an american of the best typeso rareand that the somebody elses were farther down the hill
doubtless you know her monographs in the series of medival byways
he is working at gemistus pletho
sometimes as i take tea in their beautiful grounds i hear over the wall the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot dusty unintelligent tourists who are going to do fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there and i thinkthinki think how little they think what lies so near them during this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully
lucy had a spasm of envy
granted that they wished to misbehave it was pleasant for them to be able to do so
they were probably the only people enjoying the expedition
the carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the piazza of fiesole and into the settignano road
piano
piano said mr
eager elegantly waving his hand over his head
va bene signore va bene va bene crooned the driver and whipped his horses up again
now mr
eager and miss lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of alessio baldovinetti
was he a cause of the renaissance or was he one of its manifestations
the other carriage was left behind
as the pace increased to a gallop the large slumbering form of mr emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine
piano
piano said he with a martyred look at lucy
an extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat
phaethon who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss persephone had just succeeded
a little scene ensued which as miss bartlett said afterwards was most unpleasant
the horses were stopped the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves the boy was to lose his pourboire the girl was immediately to get down
she is my sister said he turning round on them with piteous eyes
mr
eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar
phaethon hung down his head not at the matter of the accusation but at its manner
at this point mr emerson whom the shock of stopping had awoke declared that the lovers must on no account be separated and patted them on the back to signify his approval
and miss lavish though unwilling to ally him felt bound to support the cause of bohemianism
most certainly i would let them be she cried
but i dare say i shall receive scant support
i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life
this is what i call an adventure we must not submit said mr
eager
i knew he was trying it on
he is treating us as if we were a party of cooks tourists surely no said miss lavish her ardour visibly decreasing
the other carriage had drawn up behind and sensible mr beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly
leave them alone mr emerson begged the chaplain of whom he stood in no awe
do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there
to be driven by loversa king might envy us and if we part them its more like sacrilege than anything i know here the voice of miss bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect
mr
eager who suffered from an overfluent tongue rather than a resolute will was determined to make himself heard
he addressed the driver again
italian in the mouth of italians is a deepvoiced stream with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony
in mr eagers mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher and quicker and quicker and more and more shrilly till abruptly it was turned off with a click
signorina said the man to lucy when the display had ceased
why should he appeal to lucy
signorina echoed persephone in her glorious contralto
she pointed at the other carriage
why
for a moment the two girls looked at each other
then persephone got down from the box
victory at last said mr
eager smiting his hands together as the carriages started again
it is not victory said mr emerson
it is defeat
you have parted two people who were happy mr
eager shut his eyes
he was obliged to sit next to mr emerson but he would not speak to him
the old man was refreshed by sleep and took up the matter warmly
he commanded lucy to agree with him he shouted for support to his son
we have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money
he has bargained to drive us and he is doing it
we have no rights over his soul miss lavish frowned
it is hard when a person you have classed as typically british speaks out of his character
he was not driving us well she said
he jolted us that i deny
it was as restful as sleeping
aha
he is jolting us now
can you wonder
he would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified
and if i were superstitious id be frightened of the girl too
it doesnt do to injure young people
have you ever heard of lorenzo de medici miss lavish bristled
most certainly i have
do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature the lord knows
possibly he does know for i refer to lorenzo the poet
he wrote a lineso i heard yesterdaywhich runs like this dont go fighting against the spring mr
eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition
non fate guerra al maggio he murmured
war not with the may would render a correct meaning the point is we have warred with it
look he pointed to the val darno which was visible far below them through the budding trees
fifty miles of spring and weve come up to admire them
do you suppose theres any difference between spring in nature and spring in man
but there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both no one encouraged him to talk
presently mr
eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill
a hollow like a great amphitheatre full of terraced steps and misty olives now lay between them and the heights of fiesole and the road still following its curve was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain
it was this promontory uncultivated wet covered with bushes and occasional trees which had caught the fancy of alessio baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before
he had ascended it that diligent and rather obscure master possibly with an eye to business possibly for the joy of ascending
standing there he had seen that view of the val darno and distant florence which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work
but where exactly had he stood
that was the question which mr
eager hoped to solve now
and miss lavish whose nature was attracted by anything problematical had become equally enthusiastic
but it is not easy to carry the pictures of alessio baldovinetti in your head even if you have remembered to look at them before starting
and the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest
the party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions
finally they split into groups
lucy clung to miss bartlett and miss lavish the emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers while the two clergymen who were expected to have topics in common were left to each other
the two elder ladies soon threw off the mask
in the audible whisper that was now so familiar to lucy they began to discuss not alessio baldovinetti but the drive
miss bartlett had asked mr george emerson what his profession was and he had answered the railway she was very sorry that she had asked him
she had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer or she would not have asked him
mr beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him
the railway gasped miss lavish
oh but i shall die
of course it was the railway she could not control her mirth
he is the image of a porteron on the southeastern eleanor be quiet plucking at her vivacious companion
hush
theyll hearthe emersons i cant stop
let me go my wicked way
a porter eleanor im sure its all right put in lucy
the emersons wont hear and they wouldnt mind if they did miss lavish did not seem pleased at this
miss honeychurch listening she said rather crossly
pouf
wouf
you naughty girl
go away oh lucy you ought to be with mr
eager im sure i cant find them now and i dont want to either mr
eager will be offended
it is your party please id rather stop here with you no i agree said miss lavish
its like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls
miss lucy you are to go
we wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear the girl was stubborn
as her time at florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent
such a one was miss lavish and such for the moment was charlotte
she wished she had not called attention to herself they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her
how tired one gets said miss bartlett
oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here unselfishness with miss bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm
lucy did not look at the view either
she would not enjoy anything till she was safe at rome
then sit you down said miss lavish
observe my foresight with many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps
she sat on one who was to sit on the other
lucy without a moments doubt lucy
the ground will do for me
really i have not had rheumatism for years
if i do feel it coming on i shall stand
imagine your mothers feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen she sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist
here we are all settled delightfully
even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown
sit down dear you are too unselfish you dont assert yourself enough she cleared her throat
now dont be alarmed this isnt a cold
its the tiniest cough and i have had it three days
its nothing to do with sitting here at all there was only one way of treating the situation
at the end of five minutes lucy departed in search of mr beebe and mr
eager vanquished by the mackintosh square
she addressed herself to the drivers who were sprawling in the carriages perfuming the cushions with cigars
the miscreant a bony young man scorched black by the sun rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative
dove said lucy after much anxious thought
his face lit up
of course he knew where
not so far either
his arm swept threefourths of the horizon
he should just think he did know where
he pressed his fingertips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge
more seemed necessary
what was the italian for clergyman
dove buoni uomini said she at last
good
scarcely the adjective for those noble beings
he showed her his cigar
unopiupiccolo was her next remark implying has the cigar been given to you by mr beebe the smaller of the two good men she was correct as usual
he tied the horse to a tree kicked it to make it stay quiet dusted the carriage arranged his hair remoulded his hat encouraged his moustache and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her
italians are born knowing the way
it would seem that the whole earth lay before them not as a map but as a chessboard whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares
any one can find places but the finding of people is a gift from god
he only stopped once to pick her some great blue violets
she thanked him with real pleasure
in the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct
for the first time she felt the influence of spring
his arm swept the horizon gracefully violets like other things existed in great profusion there would she like to see them ma buoni uomini he bowed
certainly
good men first violets afterwards
they proceeded briskly through the undergrowth which became thicker and thicker
they were nearing the edge of the promontory and the view was stealing round them but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces
he was occupied in his cigar and in holding back the pliant boughs
she was rejoicing in her escape from dullness
not a step not a twig was unimportant to her
what is that there was a voice in the wood in the distance behind them
the voice of mr
eager
he shrugged his shoulders
an italians ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge
she could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen
the view was forming at last she could discern the river the golden plain other hills
eccolo he exclaimed
at the same moment the ground gave way and with a cry she fell out of the wood
light and beauty enveloped her
she had fallen on to a little open terrace which was covered with violets from end to end
courage cried her companion now standing some six feet above
courage and love she did not answer
from her feet the ground sloped sharply into view and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts irrigating the hillside with blue eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows covering the grass with spots of azure foam
but never again were they in such profusion this terrace was the wellhead the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth
standing at its brink like a swimmer who prepares was the good man
but he was not the good man that she had expected and he was alone
george had turned at the sound of her arrival
for a moment he contemplated her as one who had fallen out of heaven
he saw radiant joy in her face he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves
the bushes above them closed
he stepped quickly forward and kissed her
before she could speak almost before she could feel a voice called lucy
lucy
lucy the silence of life had been broken by miss bartlett who stood brown against the view
chapter vii they return some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon
what it was and exactly how the players had sided lucy was slow to discover
mr
eager had met them with a questioning eye
charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk
mr emerson seeking his son was told whereabouts to find him
mr beebe who wore the heated aspect of a neutral was bidden to collect the factions for the return home
there was a general sense of groping and bewilderment
pan had been amongst themnot the great god pan who has been buried these two thousand years but the little god pan who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics
mr beebe had lost everyone and had consumed in solitude the teabasket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise
miss lavish had lost miss bartlett
lucy had lost mr
eager
mr emerson had lost george
miss bartlett had lost a mackintosh square
phaethon had lost the game
that last fact was undeniable
he climbed on to the box shivering with his collar up prophesying the swift approach of bad weather
let us go immediately he told them
the signorino will walk all the way
he will be hours said mr beebe
apparently
i told him it was unwise he would look no one in the face perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him
he alone had played skilfully using the whole of his instinct while the others had used scraps of their intelligence
he alone had divined what things were and what he wished them to be
he alone had interpreted the message that lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man
persephone who spends half her life in the graveshe could interpret it also
not so these english
they gain knowledge slowly and perhaps too late
the thoughts of a cabdriver however just seldom affect the lives of his employers
he was the most competent of miss bartletts opponents but infinitely the least dangerous
once back in the town he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble english ladies no more
of course it was most unpleasant she had seen his black head in the bushes he might make a tavern story out of it
but after all what have we to do with taverns
real menace belongs to the drawingroom
it was of drawingroom people that miss bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun
lucy sat beside her mr
eager sat opposite trying to catch her eye he was vaguely suspicious
they spoke of alessio baldovinetti
rain and darkness came on together
the two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol
there was a lightning flash and miss lavish who was nervous screamed from the carriage in front
at the next flash lucy screamed also
mr
eager addressed her professionally courage miss honeychurch courage and faith
if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements
are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me noof course even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous
the steel knives the only articles which might attract the current are in the other carriage
and in any case we are infinitely safer than if we were walking
couragecourage and faith under the rug lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousins hand
at times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards
miss bartlett by this timely exercise of her muscles gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination
she renewed it when the two carriages stopped half into florence
mr
eager called mr beebe
we want your assistance
will you interpret for us george cried mr emerson
ask your driver which way george went
the boy may lose his way
he may be killed go mr eager said miss bartlett dont ask our driver our driver is no help
go and support poor mr beebe he is nearly demented he may be killed cried the old man
he may be killed typical behaviour said the chaplain as he quitted the carriage
in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down what does he know whispered lucy as soon as they were alone
charlotte how much does mr
eager know nothing dearest he knows nothing
but she pointed at the driverhe knows everything
dearest had we better
shall i she took out her purse
it is dreadful to be entangled with lowclass people
he saw it all tapping phaethons back with her guidebook she said silenzio and offered him a franc
va bene he replied and accepted it
as well this ending to his day as any
but lucy a mortal maid was disappointed in him
there was an explosion up the road
the storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline and one of the great supports had fallen
if they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt
they chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation and the floods of love and sincerity which fructify every hour of life burst forth in tumult
they descended from the carriages they embraced each other
it was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them
for a moment they realized vast possibilities of good
the older people recovered quickly
in the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike
miss lavish calculated that even if they had continued they would not have been caught in the accident
mr
eager mumbled a temperate prayer
but the drivers through miles of dark squalid road poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints and lucy poured out hers to her cousin
charlotte dear charlotte kiss me
kiss me again
only you can understand me
you warned me to be careful
and ii thought i was developing do not cry dearest
take your time i have been obstinate and sillyworse than you know far worse
once by the riveroh but he isnt killedhe wouldnt be killed would he the thought disturbed her repentance
as a matter of fact the storm was worst along the road but she had been near danger and so she thought it must be near to everyone
i trust not
one would always pray against that he is reallyi think he was taken by surprise just as i was before
but this time im not to blame i want you to believe that
i simply slipped into those violets
no i want to be really truthful
i am a little to blame
i had silly thoughts
the sky you know was gold and the ground all blue and for a moment he looked like someone in a book in a book heroesgodsthe nonsense of schoolgirls and then but charlotte you know what happened then miss bartlett was silent
indeed she had little more to learn
with a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her
all the way back lucys body was shaken by deep sighs which nothing could repress
i want to be truthful she whispered
it is so hard to be absolutely truthful dont be troubled dearest
wait till you are calmer
we will talk it over before bedtime in my room so they reentered the city with hands clasped
it was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others
the storm had ceased and mr emerson was easier about his son
mr beebe had regained good humour and mr
eager was already snubbing miss lavish
charlotte alone she was sure ofcharlotte whose exterior concealed so much insight and love
the luxury of selfexposure kept her almost happy through the long evening
she thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it
all her sensations her spasms of courage her moments of unreasonable joy her mysterious discontent should be carefully laid before her cousin
and together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all
at last thought she i shall understand myself
i shant again be troubled by things that come out of nothing and mean i dont know what miss alan asked her to play
she refused vehemently
music seemed to her the employment of a child
she sat close to her cousin who with commendable patience was listening to a long story about lost luggage
when it was over she capped it by a story of her own
lucy became rather hysterical with the delay
in vain she tried to check or at all events to accelerate the tale
it was not till a late hour that miss bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach well dear i at all events am ready for bedfordshire
come into my room and i will give a good brush to your hair with some solemnity the door was shut and a cane chair placed for the girl
then miss bartlett said so what is to be done she was unprepared for the question
it had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything
a detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon
what is to be done
a point dearest which you alone can settle the rain was streaming down the black windows and the great room felt damp and chilly one candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to miss bartletts toque which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door
a tram roared by in the dark and lucy felt unaccountably sad though she had long since dried her eyes
she lifted them to the ceiling where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague the very ghosts of joy
it has been raining for nearly four hours she said at last
miss bartlett ignored the remark
how do you propose to silence him the driver my dear girl no mr george emerson lucy began to pace up and down the room
i dont understand she said at last
she understood very well but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful
how are you going to stop him talking about it i have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do i too intend to judge him charitably
but unfortunately i have met the type before
they seldom keep their exploits to themselves exploits cried lucy wincing under the horrible plural
my poor dear did you suppose that this was his first
come here and listen to me
i am only gathering it from his own remarks
do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with miss alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another yes said lucy whom at the time the argument had pleased
well i am no prude
there is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined
let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish
but we are no farther on with our question
what do you propose to do an idea rushed across lucys brain which had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her might have proved victorious
i propose to speak to him said she
miss bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm
you see charlotte your kindnessi shall never forget it
butas you saidit is my affair
mine and his and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence certainly not
there would be no difficulty
whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over
i have been frightened of him
but now i am not one little bit but we fear him for you dear
you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can behow they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round
this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened i cant think said lucy gravely
something in her voice made miss bartlett repeat her question intoning it more vigorously
what would have happened if i hadnt arrived i cant think said lucy again
when he insulted you how would you have replied i hadnt time to think
you came yes but wont you tell me now what you would have done i should have she checked herself and broke the sentence off
she went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness
she could not think what she would have done
come away from the window dear said miss bartlett
you will be seen from the road lucy obeyed
she was in her cousins power
she could not modulate out the key of selfabasement in which she had started
neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to george and settle the matter whatever it was with him
miss bartlett became plaintive
oh for a real man
we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless
there is mr
eager but you do not trust him
oh for your brother
he is young but i know that his sisters insult would rouse in him a very lion
thank god chivalry is not yet dead
there are still left some men who can reverence woman as she spoke she pulled off her rings of which she wore several and ranged them upon the pin cushion
then she blew into her gloves and said it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try what train the train to rome she looked at her gloves critically
the girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given
when does the train to rome go at eight signora bertolini would be upset we must face that said miss bartlett not liking to say that she had given notice already
she will make us pay for a whole weeks pension i expect she will
however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel
isnt afternoon tea given there for nothing yes but they pay extra for wine after this remark she remained motionless and silent
to her tired eyes charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream
they began to sort their clothes for packing for there was no time to lose if they were to catch the train to rome
lucy when admonished began to move to and fro between the rooms more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill charlotte who was practical without ability knelt by the side of an empty trunk vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size
she gave two or three sighs for the stooping posture hurt her back and for all her diplomacy she felt that she was growing old
the girl heard her as she entered the room and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause
she only felt that the candle would burn better the packing go easier the world be happier if she could give and receive some human love
the impulse had come before today but never so strongly
she knelt down by her cousins side and took her in her arms
miss bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth
but she was not a stupid woman and she knew perfectly well that lucy did not love her but needed her to love
for it was in ominous tones that she said after a long pause dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me lucy was on her guard at once knowing by bitter experience what forgiving miss bartlett meant
her emotion relaxed she modified her embrace a little and she said charlotte dear what do you mean
as if i have anything to forgive you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too
i know well how much i vex you at every turn but no miss bartlett assumed her favourite role that of the prematurely aged martyr
ah but yes
i feel that our tour together is hardly the success i had hoped
i might have known it would not do
you want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you
i am too uninteresting and oldfashionedonly fit to pack and unpack your things please my only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home
i had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but i hope i did not inflict them on you more than was necessary
you had your own way about these rooms at all events you mustnt say these things said lucy softly
she still clung to the hope that she and charlotte loved each other heart and soul
they continued to pack in silence
i have been a failure said miss bartlett as she struggled with the straps of lucys trunk instead of strapping her own
failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother
she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster but mother will understand
it is not your fault this trouble and it isnt a disaster either it is my fault it is a disaster
she will never forgive me and rightly
for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish every right when i was here for your sake
if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you
your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her lucy from a cowardly wish to improve the situation said why need mother hear of it but you tell her everything i suppose i do generally i dare not break your confidence
there is something sacred in it
unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her the girl would not be degraded to this
naturally i should have told her
but in case she should blame you in any way i promise i will not i am very willing not to
i will never speak of it either to her or to any one her promise brought the longdrawn interview to a sudden close
miss bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks wished her goodnight and sent her to her own room
for a moment the original trouble was in the background
george would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually
at present she neither acquitted nor condemned him she did not pass judgement
at the moment when she was about to judge him her cousins voice had intervened and ever since it was miss bartlett who had dominated miss bartlett who even now could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall miss bartlett who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent
she had worked like a great artist for a timeindeed for yearsshe had been meaningless but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn bettera shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil but which do not seem to bring good if we may judge from those who have used them most
lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity of her craving for sympathy and love
such a wrong is not easily forgotten
never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff
and such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul
the doorbell rang and she started to the shutters
before she reached them she hesitated turned and blew out the candle
thus it was that though she saw someone standing in the wet below he though he looked up did not see her
to reach his room he had to go by hers
she was still dressed
it struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up and that their extraordinary intercourse was over
whether she would have dared to do this was never proved
at the critical moment miss bartlett opened her own door and her voice said i wish one word with you in the drawingroom mr emerson please soon their footsteps returned and miss bartlett said goodnight mr emerson his heavy tired breathing was the only reply the chaperon had done her work
lucy cried aloud it isnt true
it cant all be true
i want not to be muddled
i want to grow older quickly miss bartlett tapped on the wall
go to bed at once dear
you need all the rest you can get in the morning they left for rome
part two chapter viii medieval the drawingroom curtains at windy corner had been pulled to meet for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the august sun
they were heavy curtains reaching almost to the ground and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied
a poetnone was presentmight have quoted life like a dome of many coloured glass or might have compared the curtains to sluicegates lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven
without was poured a sea of radiance within the glory though visible was tempered to the capacities of man
two pleasant people sat in the room
onea boy of nineteenwas studying a small manual of anatomy and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano
from time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned for the day was hot and the print small and the human frame fearfully made and his mother who was writing a letter did continually read out to him what she had written
and continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet and make the remark that they were still there
where arent they said the boy who was freddy lucys brother
i tell you im getting fairly sick for goodness sake go out of my drawingroom then cried mrs honeychurch who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally
freddy did not move or reply
i think things are coming to a head she observed rather wanting her sons opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication
time they did i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more its his third go isnt it freddy i do call the way you talk unkind i didnt mean to be unkind then he added but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy
i dont know how girls manage things but she cant have said no properly before or she wouldnt have to say it again now
over the whole thingi cant explaini do feel so uncomfortable do you indeed dear
how interesting i feelnever mind he returned to his work
just listen to what i have written to mrs vyse
i said dear mrs vyse yes mother you told me
a jolly good letter i said dear mrs vyse cecil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it
but she stopped reading i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all
he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth
when it comes to the point he cant get on without me nor me you freddy nodded
what do you mean he asked me for my permission also she exclaimed how very odd of him why so asked the son and heir
why shouldnt my permission be asked what do you know about lucy or girls or anything
what ever did you say i said to cecil take her or leave her its no business of mine what a helpful answer but her own answer though more normal in its wording had been to the same effect
the bother is this began freddy
then he took up his work again too shy to say what the bother was
mrs honeychurch went back to the window
freddy you must come
there they still are i dont see you ought to go peeping like that peeping like that
cant i look out of my own window but she returned to the writingtable observing as she passed her son still page freddy snorted and turned over two leaves
for a brief space they were silent
close by beyond the curtains the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased
the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully he gave a nervous gulp
not content with permission which i did givethat is to say i said i dont mindwell not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasnt off my head with joy
he practically put it like this wasnt it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her
and he would have an answerhe said it would strengthen his hand i hope you gave a careful answer dear i answered no said the boy grinding his teeth
there
fly into a stew
i cant help ithad to say it
i had to say no
he ought never to have asked me ridiculous child cried his mother
you think youre so holy and truthful but really its only abominable conceit
do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say
i hope he boxed your ears
how dare you say no oh do keep quiet mother
i had to say no when i couldnt say yes
i tried to laugh as if i didnt mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right
but i feel my foots in it
oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work no said mrs honeychurch with the air of one who has considered the subject i shall not keep quiet
you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house not a bit he pleaded
i only let out i didnt like him
i dont hate him but i dont like him
what i mind is that hell tell lucy he glanced at the curtains dismally
well i like him said mrs honeychurch
i know his mother hes good hes clever hes rich hes well connectedoh you neednt kick the piano
hes well connectedill say it again if you like hes well connected she paused as if rehearsing her eulogy but her face remained dissatisfied
she added and he has beautiful manners i liked him till just now
i suppose its having him spoiling lucys first week at home and its also something that mr beebe said not knowing mr
beebe said his mother trying to conceal her interest
i dont see how mr beebe comes in you know mr beebes funny way when you never quite know what he means
he said mr
vyse is an ideal bachelor i was very cute i asked him what he meant
he said oh hes like mebetter detached i couldnt make him say any more but it set me thinking
since cecil has come after lucy he hasnt been so pleasant at leasti cant explain you never can dear
but i can
you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties the explanation seemed plausible and freddy tried to accept it
but at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust
cecil praised one too much for being athletic
was that it
cecil made one talk in ones own way
this tired one
was that it
and cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellows cap
unaware of his own profundity freddy checked himself
he must be jealous or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons
will this do called his mother
dear mrs vysececil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it then i put in at the top and i have told lucy so i must write the letter out againand i have told lucy so
but lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves i said that because i didnt want mrs vyse to think us oldfashioned
she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maids dirty thumbmarks where you turn on the electric light
she keeps that flat abominably suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country dont interrupt so foolishly
where was i
oh yesyoung people must decide for themselves
i know that lucy likes your son because she tells me everything and she wrote to me from rome when he asked her first no ill cross that last bit outit looks patronizing
ill stop at because she tells me everything or shall i cross that out too cross it out too said freddy
mrs honeychurch left it in
then the whole thing runs dear mrs vysececil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it and i have told lucy so
but lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves
i know that lucy likes your son because she tells me everything
but i do not know look out cried freddy
the curtains parted
cecils first movement was one of irritation
he couldnt bear the honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture
instinctively he give the curtains a twitch and sent them swinging down their poles
light entered
there was revealed a terrace such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it and on it a little rustic seat and two flowerbeds
but it was transfigured by the view beyond for windy corner was built on the range that overlooks the sussex weald
lucy who was in the little seat seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world
cecil entered
appearing thus late in the story cecil must be at once described
he was medieval
like a gothic statue
tall and refined with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a french cathedral
well educated well endowed and not deficient physically he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as selfconsciousness and whom the medieval with dimmer vision worshipped as asceticism
a gothic statue implies celibacy just as a greek statue implies fruition and perhaps this was what mr beebe meant
and freddy who ignored history and art perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine cecil wearing another fellows cap
mrs honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance
oh cecil she exclaimedoh cecil do tell me i promessi sposi said he
they stared at him anxiously
she has accepted me he said and the sound of the thing in english made him flush and smile with pleasure and look more human
i am so glad said mrs honeychurch while freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals
they wished that they also knew italian for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones
we are obliged to become vaguely poetic or to take refuge in scriptural reminiscences
welcome as one of the family said mrs honeychurch waving her hand at the furniture
this is indeed a joyous day
i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy i hope so replied the young man shifting his eyes to the ceiling
we mothers simpered mrs honeychurch and then realized that she was affected sentimental bombasticall the things she hated most
why could she not be freddy who stood stiff in the middle of the room looking very cross and almost handsome
i say lucy called cecil for conversation seemed to flag
lucy rose from the seat
she moved across the lawn and smiled in at them just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis
then she saw her brothers face
her lips parted and she took him in her arms
he said steady on not a kiss for me asked her mother
lucy kissed her also
would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it cecil suggested
and id stop here and tell my mother we go with lucy said freddy as if taking orders
yes you go with lucy they passed into the sunlight
cecil watched them cross the terrace and descend out of sight by the steps
they would descendhe knew their wayspast the shrubbery and past the tennislawn and the dahliabed until they reached the kitchen garden and there in the presence of the potatoes and the peas the great event would be discussed
smiling indulgently he lit a cigarette and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion
he had known lucy for several years but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical
he could still remember his depression that afternoon at rome when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue and demanded to be taken to st peters
that day she had seemed a typical touristshrill crude and gaunt with travel
but italy worked some marvel in her
it gave her light andwhich he held more preciousit gave her shadow
soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence
she was like a woman of leonardo da vincis whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us
the things are assuredly not of this life no woman of leonardos could have anything so vulgar as a story she did develop most wonderfully day by day
so it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion at least to a profound uneasiness
already at rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other
it had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion
her refusal had been clear and gentle after itas the horrid phrase wentshe had been exactly the same to him as before
three months later on the margin of italy among the flowerclad alps he had asked her again in bald traditional language
she reminded him of a leonardo more than ever her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her
he walked home with her unashamed feeling not at all like a rejected suitor
the things that really mattered were unshaken
so now he had asked her once more and clear and gentle as ever she had accepted him giving no coy reasons for her delay but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy
his mother too would be pleased she had counselled the step he must write her a long account
glancing at his hand in case any of freddys chemicals had come off on it he moved to the writing table
there he saw dear mrs vyse followed by many erasures
he recoiled without reading any more and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere and pencilled a note on his knee
then he lit another cigarette which did not seem quite as divine as the first and considered what might be done to make windy corner drawingroom more distinctive
with that outlook it should have been a successful room but the trail of tottenham court road was upon it he could almost visualize the motorvans of messrs shoolbred and messrs
maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair those varnished bookcases that writingtable
the table recalled mrs honeychurchs letter
he did not want to read that letterhis temptations never lay in that direction but he worried about it none the less
it was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win lucy he wanted to feel that others no matter who they were agreed with him and so he had asked their permission
mrs honeychurch had been civil but obtuse in essentials while as for freddyhe is only a boy he reflected
i represent all that he despises
why should he want me for a brotherinlaw the honeychurches were a worthy family but he began to realize that lucy was of another clay and perhapshe did not put it very definitelyhe ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible
mr
beebe said the maid and the new rector of summer street was shown in he had at once started on friendly relations owing to lucys praise of him in her letters from florence
cecil greeted him rather critically
ive come for tea mr vyse
do you suppose that i shall get it i should say so
food is the thing one does get heredont sit in that chair young honeychurch has left a bone in it pfui i know said cecil
i know
i cant think why mrs honeychurch allows it for cecil considered the bone and the maples furniture separately he did not realize that taken together they kindled the room into the life that he desired
ive come for tea and for gossip
isnt this news news
i dont understand you said cecil
news mr beebe whose news was of a very different nature prattled forward
i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field
he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack has he indeed said cecil trying to recover himself
into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen
was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant
but his stiffness remained and though he asked who cissie and albert might be he still thought mr beebe rather a bounder
unpardonable question
to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semidetached villas that have been run up opposite the church
ill set mrs honeychurch after you im shockingly stupid over local affairs said the young man languidly
i cant even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board
perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those arent the right names
i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery
it is very remiss of me
italy and london are the only places where i dont feel to exist on sufferance mr beebe distressed at this heavy reception of cissie and albert determined to shift the subject
let me see mr vysei forgetwhat is your profession i have no profession said cecil
it is another example of my decadence
my attitudequite an indefensible oneis that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like
i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i dont care a straw about but somehow ive not been able to begin you are very fortunate said mr beebe
it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure his voice was rather parochial but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally
he felt as all who have regular occupation must feel that others should have it also
i am glad that you approve
i darent face the healthy personfor example freddy honeychurch oh freddys a good sort isnt he admirable
the sort who has made england what she is cecil wondered at himself
why on this day of all others was he so hopelessly contrary
he tried to get right by inquiring effusively after mr beebes mother an old lady for whom he had no particular regard
then he flattered the clergyman praised his liberalmindedness his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science
where are the others said mr beebe at last i insist on extracting tea before evening service i suppose anne never told them you were here
in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives
the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chairlegs with her feet
the faults of maryi forget the faults of mary but they are very grave
shall we look in the garden i know the faults of mary
she leaves the dustpans standing on the stairs the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small they both laughed and things began to go better
the faults of freddy cecil continued
ah he has too many
no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy
try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable she has none said the young man with grave sincerity
i quite agree
at present she has none at present im not cynical
im only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch
does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly
i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both
the watertight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle
then we shall have her heroically good heroically badtoo heroic perhaps to be good or bad cecil found his companion interesting
and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes well i must say ive only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence
since i came to summer street she has been away
you saw her didnt you at rome and in the alps
oh i forgot of course you knew her before
no she wasnt wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be in what way conversation had become agreeable to them and they were pacing up and down the terrace
i could as easily tell you what tune shell play next
there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them
i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string
picture number two the string breaks the sketch was in his diary but it had been made afterwards when he viewed things artistically
at the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself
but the string never broke no
i mightnt have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall it has broken now said the young man in low vibrating tones
immediately he realized that of all the conceited ludicrous contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst
he cursed his love of metaphor had he suggested that he was a star and that lucy was soaring up to reach him
broken
what do you mean i meant said cecil stiffly that she is going to marry me the clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice
i am sorry i must apologize
i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way
mr vyse you ought to have stopped me and down the garden he saw lucy herself yes he was disappointed
cecil who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies drew down his mouth at the corners
was this the reception his action would get from the world
of course he despised the world as a whole every thoughtful man should it is almost a test of refinement
but he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered
occasionally he could be quite crude
i am sorry i have given you a shock he said dryly
i fear that lucys choice does not meet with your approval not that
but you ought to have stopped me
i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes
perhaps i oughtnt to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you you are conscious of having said something indiscreet mr beebe pulled himself together
really mr vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions
he was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession
no i have said nothing indiscreet
i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended
i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step
she has taken it
she has learntyou will let me talk freely as i have begun freelyshe has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides it was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio
he did not omit to do so
she has learnt through you and if his voice was still clerical it was now also sincere let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her grazie tante said cecil who did not like parsons
have you heard shouted mrs honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden
oh mr beebe have you heard the news freddy now full of geniality whistled the wedding march
youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact
indeed i have he cried
he looked at lucy
in her presence he could not act the parson any longerat all events not without apology
mrs
honeychurch im going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally im too shy
i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small
i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother
and now i want my tea you only asked for it just in time the lady retorted
how dare you be serious at windy corner he took his tone from her
there was no more heavy beneficence no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the scriptures
none of them dared or was able to be serious any more
an engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe
away from it in the solitude of their rooms mr beebe and even freddy might again be critical
but in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious
it has a strange power for it compels not only the lips but the very heart
the chief parallel to compare one great thing with anotheris the power over us of a temple of some alien creed
standing outside we deride or oppose it or at the most feel sentimental
inside though the saints and gods are not ours we become true believers in case any true believer should be present
so it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant teaparty
if they were hypocrites they did not know it and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true
anne putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present stimulated them greatly
they could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawingroom door
mr beebe chirruped
freddy was at his wittiest referring to cecil as the fiascofamily honoured pun on fiance
mrs honeychurch amusing and portly promised well as a motherinlaw
as for lucy and cecil for whom the temple had been built they also joined in the merry ritual but waited as earnest worshippers should for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy
chapter ix lucy as a work of art a few days after the engagement was announced mrs honeychurch made lucy and her fiasco come to a little gardenparty in the neighbourhood for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man
cecil was more than presentable he looked distinguished and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with lucy and his long fair face responding when lucy spoke to him
people congratulated mrs honeychurch which is i believe a social blunder but it pleased her and she introduced cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers
at tea a misfortune took place a cup of coffee was upset over lucys figured silk and though lucy feigned indifference her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid
they were gone some time and cecil was left with the dowagers
when they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been
do you go to much of this sort of thing he asked when they were driving home
oh now and then said lucy who had rather enjoyed herself
is it typical of country society i suppose so
mother would it be plenty of society said mrs honeychurch who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses
seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere cecil bent towards lucy and said to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous i am so sorry that you were stranded not that but the congratulations
it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public propertya kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment
all those old women smirking one has to go through it i suppose
they wont notice us so much next time but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong
an engagementhorrid word in the first placeis a private matter and should be treated as such yet the smirking old women however wrong individually were racially correct
the spirit of the generations had smiled through them rejoicing in the engagement of cecil and lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth
to cecil and lucy it promised something quite differentpersonal love
hence cecils irritation and lucys belief that his irritation was just
how tiresome she said
couldnt you have escaped to tennis i dont play tennisat least not in public
the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic
such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato inglese italianato e un diavolo incarnato
you know the proverb she did not
nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in rome with his mother
but cecil since his engagement had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing
well said he i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me
there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them we all have our limitations i suppose said wise lucy
sometimes they are forced on us though said cecil who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position
how it makes a difference doesnt it whether we fully fence ourselves in or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others she thought a moment and agreed that it did make a difference
difference cried mrs honeychurch suddenly alert
i dont see any difference
fences are fences especially when they are in the same place we were speaking of motives said cecil on whom the interruption jarred
my dear cecil look here she spread out her knees and perched her cardcase on her lap
this is me
thats windy corner
the rest of the pattern is the other people
motives are all very well but the fence comes here we werent talking of real fences said lucy laughing
oh i see dearpoetry she leant placidly back
cecil wondered why lucy had been amused
i tell you who has no fences as you call them she said and thats mr beebe a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless lucy was slow to follow what people said but quick enough to detect what they meant
she missed cecils epigram but grasped the feeling that prompted it
dont you like mr beebe she asked thoughtfully
i never said so he cried
i consider him far above the average
i only denied and he swept off on the subject of fences again and was brilliant
now a clergyman that i do hate said she wanting to say something sympathetic a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr
eager the english chaplain at florence
he was truly insincerenot merely the manner unfortunate
he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things what sort of things there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife perhaps he had no why no he was such a nice old man im sure cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence
well i did try to sift the thing
mr
eager would never come to the point
he prefers it vaguesaid the old man had practically murdered his wifehad murdered her in the sight of god hush dear said mrs honeychurch absently
but isnt it intolerable that a person whom were told to imitate should go round spreading slander
it was i believe chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped
people pretended he was vulgar but he certainly wasnt that poor old man
what was his name harris said lucy glibly
lets hope that mrs harris there warnt no sich person said her mother
cecil nodded intelligently
isnt mr
eager a parson of the cultured type he asked
i dont know
i hate him
ive heard him lecture on giotto
i hate him
nothing can hide a petty nature
i hate him my goodness gracious me child said mrs honeychurch
youll blow my head off
whatever is there to shout over
i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen he smiled
there was indeed something rather incongruous in lucys moral outburst over mr
eager
it was as if one should see the leonardo on the ceiling of the sistine
he longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation that a womans power and charm reside in mystery not in muscular rant
but possibly rant is a sign of vitality it mars the beautiful creature but shows that she is alive
after a moment he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval
he forebore to repress the sources of youth
naturesimplest of topics he thoughtlay around them
he praised the pinewoods the deep lasts of bracken the crimson leaves that spotted the hurtbushes the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road
the outdoor world was not very familiar to him and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact
mrs honeychurchs mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch
i count myself a lucky person he concluded when im in london i feel i could never live out of it
when im in the country i feel the same about the country
after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best
its true that in nine cases out of ten they dont seem to notice anything
the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions
yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town
do you feel that mrs honeychurch mrs honeychurch started and smiled
she had not been attending
cecil who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria felt irritable and determined not to say anything interesting again
lucy had not attended either
her brow was wrinkled and she still looked furiously crossthe result he concluded of too much moral gymnastics
it was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an august wood
come down o maid from yonder mountain height he quoted and touched her knee with his own
she flushed again and said what height come down o maid from yonder mountain height what pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang
in height and in the splendour of the hills let us take mrs honeychurchs advice and hate clergymen no more
whats this place summer street of course said lucy and roused herself
the woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow
pretty cottages lined it on two sides and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church expensively simple a charming shingled spire
mr beebes house was near the church
in height it scarcely exceeded the cottages
some great mansions were at hand but they were hidden in the trees
the scene suggested a swiss alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world and was marred only by two ugly little villasthe villas that had competed with cecils engagement having been acquired by sir harry otway the very afternoon that lucy had been acquired by cecil
cissie was the name of one of these villas albert of the other
these titles were not only picked out in shaded gothic on the garden gates but appeared a second time on the porches where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals
albert was inhabited
his tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells
his little windows were chastely swathed in nottingham lace
cissie was to let
three noticeboards belonging to dorking agents lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact
her paths were already weedy her pockethandkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions
the place is ruined said the ladies mechanically
summer street will never be the same again as the carriage passed cissies door opened and a gentleman came out of her
stop cried mrs honeychurch touching the coachman with her parasol
heres sir harry
now we shall know
sir harry pull those things down at once sir harry otwaywho need not be describedcame to the carriage and said mrs
honeychurch i meant to
i cant i really cant turn out miss flack am i not always right
she ought to have gone before the contract was signed
does she still live rent free as she did in her nephews time but what can i do he lowered his voice
an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden turn her out said cecil bravely
sir harry sighed and looked at the villas mournfully
he had had full warning of mr flacks intentions and might have bought the plot before building commenced but he was apathetic and dilatory
he had known summer street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt
not till mrs flack had laid the foundation stone and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm
he called on mr flack the local buildera most reasonable and respectful manwho agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof but pointed out that slates were cheaper
he ventured to differ however about the corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows saying that for his part he liked to relieve the faade by a bit of decoration
sir harry hinted that a column if possible should be structural as well as decorative
mr flack replied that all the columns had been ordered adding and all the capitals differentone with dragons in the foliage another approaching to the ionian style another introducing mrs flacks initialsevery one different for he had read his ruskin
he built his villas according to his desire and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did sir harry buy
this futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on mrs honeychurchs carriage
he had failed in his duties to the countryside and the countryside was laughing at him as well
he had spent money and yet summer street was spoilt as much as ever
all he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for cissiesomeone really desirable
the rent is absurdly low he told them and perhaps i am an easy landlord
but it is such an awkward size
it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise sir harry for despising them
the latter impulse seemed the more fruitful
you ought to find a tenant at once he said maliciously
it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk exactly said sir harry excitedly
that is exactly what i fear mr vyse
it will attract the wrong type of people
the train service has improveda fatal improvement to my mind
and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles rather a strenuous clerk it would be said lucy
cecil who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate
she saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour and roused herself to stop him
sir harry she exclaimed i have an idea
how would you like spinsters my dear lucy it would be splendid
do you know any such yes i met them abroad gentlewomen he asked tentatively
yes indeed and at the present moment homeless
i heard from them last weekmiss teresa and miss catharine alan
im really not joking
they are quite the right people
mr beebe knows them too
may i tell them to write to you indeed you may he cried
here we are with the difficulty solved already
how delightful it is
extra facilitiesplease tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees
oh the agents
the appalling people they have sent me
one woman when i wrotea tactful letter you knowasking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance
as if one cares about that
and several references i took up were most unsatisfactorypeople swindlers or not respectable
and oh the deceit
i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week
the deceit of the most promising people
my dear lucy the deceit she nodded
my advice put in mrs honeychurch is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all
i know the type
preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy
its a sad thing but id far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down i think i follow you said sir harry but it is as you say a very sad thing the misses alan arent that cried lucy
yes they are said cecil
i havent met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood dont listen to him sir harryhes tiresome its i who am tiresome he replied
i oughtnt to come with my troubles to young people
but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help then may i write to my misses alan please but his eye wavered when mrs honeychurch exclaimed beware
they are certain to have canaries
sir harry beware of canaries they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come
beware of women altogether
only let to a man really he murmured gallantly though he saw the wisdom of her remark
men dont gossip over teacups
if they get drunk theres an end of themthey lie down comfortably and sleep it off
if theyre vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves
it doesnt spread so
give me a manof course provided hes clean sir harry blushed
neither he nor cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex
even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction
he suggested that mrs honeychurch if she had time should descend from the carriage and inspect cissie for herself
she was delighted
nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house
domestic arrangements always attracted her especially when they were on a small scale
cecil pulled lucy back as she followed her mother
mrs
honeychurch he said what if we two walk home and leave you certainly was her cordial reply
sir harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them
he beamed at them knowingly said aha
young people young people and then hastened to unlock the house
hopeless vulgarian exclaimed cecil almost before they were out of earshot
oh cecil i cant help it
it would be wrong not to loathe that man he isnt clever but really he is nice no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life
in london he would keep his place
he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties
but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and every oneeven your motheris taken in all that you say is quite true said lucy though she felt discouraged
i wonder whetherwhether it matters so very much it matters supremely
sir harry is the essence of that gardenparty
oh goodness how cross i feel
how i do hope hell get some vulgar tenant in that villasome woman so really vulgar that hell notice it
gentlefolks ugh
with his bald head and retreating chin
but lets forget him this lucy was glad enough to do
if cecil disliked sir harry otway and mr beebe what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape
for instance freddy
freddy was neither clever nor subtle nor beautiful and what prevented cecil from saying any minute it would be wrong not to loathe freddy
and what would she reply
further than freddy she did not go but he gave her anxiety enough
she could only assure herself that cecil had known freddy some time and that they had always got on pleasantly except perhaps during the last few days which was an accident perhaps
which way shall we go she asked him
naturesimplest of topics she thoughtwas around them
summer street lay deep in the woods and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad
are there two ways perhaps the road is more sensible as were got up smart id rather go through the wood said cecil with that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon
why is it lucy that you always say the road
do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged havent i
the wood then said lucy startled at his queerness but pretty sure that he would explain later it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning
she led the way into the whispering pines and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards
i had got an ideai dare say wronglythat you feel more at home with me in a room a room she echoed hopelessly bewildered
yes
or at the most in a garden or on a road
never in the real country like this oh cecil whatever do you mean
i have never felt anything of the sort
you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person i dont know that you arent
i connect you with a viewa certain type of view
why shouldnt you connect me with a room she reflected a moment and then said laughing do you know that youre right
i do
i must be a poetess after all
when i think of you its always as in a room
how funny to her surprise he seemed annoyed
a drawingroom pray
with no view yes with no view i fancy
why not id rather he said reproachfully that you connected me with the open air she said again oh cecil whatever do you mean as no explanation was forthcoming she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl and led him further into the wood pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees
she had known the wood between summer street and windy corner ever since she could walk alone she had played at losing freddy in it when freddy was a purplefaced baby and though she had been to italy it had lost none of its charm
presently they came to a little clearing among the pinesanother tiny green alp solitary this time and holding in its bosom a shallow pool
she exclaimed the sacred lake why do you call it that i cant remember why
i suppose it comes out of some book
its only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it
well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and cant get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful
then freddy used to bathe there
he is very fond of it and you he meant are you fond of it but she answered dreamily i bathed here too till i was found out
then there was a row at another time he might have been shocked for he had depths of prudishness within him
but now
with his momentary cult of the fresh air he was delighted at her admirable simplicity
he looked at her as she stood by the pools edge
she was got up smart as she phrased it and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own but blooms abruptly out of a world of green
who found you out charlotte she murmured
she was stopping with us
charlottecharlotte poor girl she smiled gravely
a certain scheme from which hitherto he had shrunk now appeared practical
lucy yes i suppose we ought to be going was her reply
lucy i want to ask something of you that i have never asked before at the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him
what cecil hitherto nevernot even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me he became selfconscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed
his courage had gone
yes up to now i have never kissed you she was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately
nomore you have she stammered
then i ask youmay i now of course you may cecil
you might before
i cant run at you you know at that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities
her reply was inadequate
she gave such a businesslike lift to her veil
as he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil
as he touched her his gold pincenez became dislodged and was flattened between them
such was the embrace
he considered with truth that it had been a failure
passion should believe itself irresistible
it should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature
above all it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way
why could he not do as any labourer or navvynay as any young man behind the counter would have done
he recast the scene
lucy was standing flowerlike by the water he rushed up and took her in his arms she rebuked him permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness
for he believed that women revere men for their manliness
they left the pool in silence after this one salutation
he waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts
at last she spoke and with fitting gravity
emerson was the name not harris what name the old mans what old man that old man i told you about
the one mr
eager was so unkind to he could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had
chapter x cecil as a humourist the society out of which cecil proposed to rescue lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to
her father a prosperous local solicitor had built windy corner as a speculation at the time the district was opening up and falling in love with his own creation had ended by living there himself
soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter
other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others again among the pinetrees behind and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs
most of these houses were larger than windy corner and were filled by people who came not from the district but from london and who mistook the honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy
he was inclined to be frightened but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility
i cannot think what people are doing she would say but it is extremely fortunate for the children she called everywhere her calls were returned with enthusiasm and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their milieu they liked her and it did not seem to matter
when mr honeychurch died he had the satisfactionwhich few honest solicitors despiseof leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable
the best obtainable
certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull and lucy realized this more vividly since her return from italy
hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioningtheir kindly affluence their inexplosive religion their dislike of paperbags orangepeel and broken bottles
a radical out and out she learnt to speak with horror of suburbia
life so far as she troubled to conceive it was a circle of rich pleasant people with identical interests and identical foes
in this circle one thought married and died
outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter just as the london fog tries to enter the pinewoods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills
but in italy where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality as in the sun this conception of life vanished
her senses expanded she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like that social barriers were irremovable doubtless but not particularly high
you jump over them just as you jump into a peasants oliveyard in the apennines and he is glad to see you
she returned with new eyes
so did cecil but italy had quickened cecil not to tolerance but to irritation
he saw that the local society was narrow but instead of saying does that very much matter he rebelled and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad
he did not realize that lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time and that though her eyes saw its defects her heart refused to despise it entirely
nor did he realize a more important pointthat if she was too great for this society she was too great for all society and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her
a rebel she was but not of the kind he understooda rebel who desired not a wider dwellingroom but equality beside the man she loved
for italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessionsher own soul
playing bumblepuppy with minnie beebe niece to the rector and aged thirteenan ancient and most honourable game which consists in striking tennisballs high into the air so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce some hit mrs honeychurch others are lost
the sentence is confused but the better illustrates lucys state of mind for she was trying to talk to mr beebe at the same time
oh it has been such a nuisancefirst he then theyno one knowing what they wanted and everyone so tiresome but they really are coming now said mr beebe
i wrote to miss teresa a few days agoshe was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably
they are coming
i heard from them this morning
i shall hate those miss alans mrs honeychurch cried
just because theyre old and silly ones expected to say how sweet i hate their ifing and buting and anding
and poor lucyserve her rightworn to a shadow mr beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tenniscourt
cecil was absentone did not play bumblepuppy when he was there
well if they are comingno minnie not saturn saturn was a tennisball whose skin was partially unsewn
when in motion his orb was encircled by a ring
if they are coming sir harry will let them move in before the twentyninth and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings because it made them nervous and put in the fair wear and tear onethat doesnt count
i told you not saturn saturns all right for bumblepuppy cried freddy joining them
minnie dont you listen to her saturn doesnt bounce saturn bounces enough no he doesnt well he bounces better than the beautiful white devil hush dear said mrs honeychurch
but look at lucycomplaining of saturn and all the times got the beautiful white devil in her hand ready to plug it in
thats right minnie go for herget her over the shins with the racquetget her over the shins lucy fell the beautiful white devil rolled from her hand
mr beebe picked it up and said the name of this ball is vittoria corombona please but his correction passed unheeded
freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury and in half a minute he had transformed minnie from a wellmannered child into a howling wilderness
up in the house cecil heard them and though he was full of entertaining news he did not come down to impart it in case he got hurt
he was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man
but he hated the physical violence of the young
how right it was
sure enough it ended in a cry
i wish the miss alans could see this observed mr beebe just as lucy who was nursing the injured minnie was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother
who are the miss alans freddy panted
they have taken cissie villa that wasnt the name here his foot slipped and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass
an interval elapses
wasnt what name asked lucy with her brothers head in her lap
alan wasnt the name of the people sir harrys let to nonsense freddy
you know nothing about it nonsense yourself
ive this minute seen him
he said to me ahem
honeychurchfreddy was an indifferent mimicahem
ahem
i have at last procured really deesirerebel tenants i said ooray old boy and slapped him on the back exactly
the miss alans rather not
more like anderson oh good gracious there isnt going to be another muddle mrs honeychurch exclaimed
do you notice lucy im always right
i said dont interfere with cissie villa
im always right
im quite uneasy at being always right so often its only another muddle of freddys
freddy doesnt even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead yes i do
ive got it
emerson what name emerson
ill bet you anything you like what a weathercock sir harry is said lucy quietly
i wish i had never bothered over it at all then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky
mr beebe whose opinion of her rose daily whispered to his niece that that was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong
meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted mrs honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities
emerson freddy
do you know what emersons they are i dont know whether theyre any emersons retorted freddy who was democratic
like his sister and like most young people he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of emersons annoyed him beyond measure
i trust they are the right sort of person
all right lucyshe was sitting up againi see you looking down your nose and thinking your mothers a snob
but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and its affectation to pretend there isnt emersons a common enough name lucy remarked
she was gazing sideways
seated on a promontory herself she could see the pineclad promontories descending one beyond another into the weald
the further one descended the garden the more glorious was this lateral view
i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man
pray does that satisfy you oh yes he grumbled
and you will be satisfied too for theyre friends of cecil soelaborate ironyyou and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety cecil exclaimed lucy
dont be rude dear said his mother placidly
lucy dont screech
its a new bad habit youre getting into but has cecil friends of cecils he repeated and so really deesirerebel
ahem
honeychurch i have just telegraphed to them she got up from the grass
it was hard on lucy
mr beebe sympathized with her very much
while she believed that her snub about the miss alans came from sir harry otway she had borne it like a good girl
she might well screech when she heard that it came partly from her lover
mr vyse was a teasesomething worse than a tease he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people
the clergyman knowing this looked at miss honeychurch with more than his usual kindness
when she exclaimed but cecils emersonsthey cant possibly be the same onesthere is that he did not consider that the exclamation was strange but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure
he diverted it as follows the emersons who were at florence do you mean
no i dont suppose it will prove to be them
it is probably a long cry from them to friends of mr vyses
oh mrs honeychurch the oddest people
the queerest people
for our part we liked them didnt we he appealed to lucy
there was a great scene over some violets
they picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very miss alans who have failed to come to cissie villa
poor little ladies
so shocked and so pleased
it used to be one of miss catharines great stories
my dear sister loves flowers it began
they found the whole room a mass of bluevases and jugsand the story ends with so ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful it is all very difficult
yes i always connect those florentine emersons with violets fiascos done you this time remarked freddy not seeing that his sisters face was very red
she could not recover herself
mr beebe saw it and continued to divert the conversation
these particular emersons consisted of a father and a sonthe son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immaturepessimism et cetera
our special joy was the fathersuch a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife in his normal state mr beebe would never have repeated such gossip but he was trying to shelter lucy in her little trouble
he repeated any rubbish that came into his head
murdered his wife said mrs honeychurch
lucy dont desert usgo on playing bumblepuppy
really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place
thats the second murderer ive heard of as being there
whatever was charlotte doing to stop
bytheby we really must ask charlotte here some time mr beebe could recall no second murderer
he suggested that his hostess was mistaken
at the hint of opposition she warmed
she was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told
the name escaped her
what was the name
oh what was the name
she clasped her knees for the name
something in thackeray
she struck her matronly forehead
lucy asked her brother whether cecil was in
oh dont go he cried and tried to catch her by the ankles
i must go she said gravely
dont be silly
you always overdo it when you play as she left them her mothers shout of harris shivered the tranquil air and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right
such a senseless lie too yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these emersons friends of cecils with a pair of nondescript tourists
hitherto truth had come to her naturally
she saw that for the future she must be more vigilant and beabsolutely truthful
well at all events she must not tell lies
she hurried up the garden still flushed with shame
a word from cecil would soothe her she was sure
cecil hullo he called and leant out of the smokingroom window
he seemed in high spirits
i was hoping youd come
i heard you all beargardening but theres better fun up here
i even i have won a great victory for the comic muse
george merediths rightthe cause of comedy and the cause of truth are really the same and i even i have found tenants for the distressful cissie villa
dont be angry
dont be angry
youll forgive me when you hear it all he looked very attractive when his face was bright and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once
i have heard she said
freddy has told us
naughty cecil
i suppose i must forgive you
just think of all the trouble i took for nothing
certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and id rather have nice friends of yours
but you oughtnt to tease one so friends of mine he laughed
but lucy the whole joke is to come
come here but she remained standing where she was
do you know where i met these desirable tenants
in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week what an odd place to meet people she said nervously
i dont quite understand in the umbrian room
absolute strangers
they were admiring luca signorelliof course quite stupidly
however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little
they had been to italy but cecil proceeded hilariously
in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottagethe father to live there the son to run down for weekends
i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they werent actual blackguardsit was great sportand wrote to him making out cecil
no its not fair
ive probably met them before he bore her down
perfectly fair
anything is fair that punishes a snob
that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good
sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time
no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long youll agree with me
there ought to be intermarriageall sorts of things
i believe in democracy no you dont she snapped
you dont know what the word means he stared at her and felt again that she had failed to be leonardesque
no you dont her face was inartisticthat of a peevish virago
it isnt fair cecil
i blame youi blame you very much indeed
you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans and make me look ridiculous
you call it scoring off sir harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense
i consider it most disloyal of you she left him
temper he thought raising his eyebrows
no it was worse than tempersnobbishness
as long as lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the miss alans she had not minded
he perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally
he would tolerate the father and draw out the son who was silent
in the interests of the comic muse and of truth he would bring them to windy corner
chapter xi in mrs vyses wellappointed flat the comic muse though able to look after her own interests did not disdain the assistance of mr vyse
his idea of bringing the emersons to windy corner struck her as decidedly good and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch
sir harry otway signed the agreement met mr emerson who was duly disillusioned
the miss alans were duly offended and wrote a dignified letter to lucy whom they held responsible for the failure
mr beebe planned pleasant moments for the newcomers and told mrs honeychurch that freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived
indeed so ample was the muses equipment that she permitted mr harris never a very robust criminal to droop his head to be forgotten and to die
lucyto descend from bright heaven to earth whereon there are shadows because there are hillslucy was at first plunged into despair but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least
now that she was engaged the emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood
and cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood
therefore cecil was welcome to bring the emersons into the neighbourhood
but as i say this took a little thinking andso illogical are girlsthe event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done
she was glad that a visit to mrs vyse now fell due the tenants moved into cissie villa while she was safe in the london flat
cecilcecil darling she whispered the evening she arrived and crept into his arms
cecil too became demonstrative
he saw that the needful fire had been kindled in lucy
at last she longed for attention as a woman should and looked up to him because he was a man
so you do love me little thing he murmured
oh cecil i do i do
i dont know what i should do without you several days passed
then she had a letter from miss bartlett
a coolness had sprung up between the two cousins and they had not corresponded since they parted in august
the coolness dated from what charlotte would call the flight to rome and in rome it had increased amazingly
for the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical
charlotte unselfish in the forum would have tried a sweeter temper than lucys and once in the baths of caracalla they had doubted whether they could continue their tour
lucy had said she would join the vysesmrs
vyse was an acquaintance of her mother so there was no impropriety in the plan and miss bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly
finally nothing happened but the coolness remained and for lucy was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows
it had been forwarded from windy corner
tunbridge wells september
dearest lucia i have news of you at last
miss lavish has been bicycling in your parts but was not sure whether a call would be welcome
puncturing her tire near summer street and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard she saw to her astonishment a door open opposite and the younger emerson man come out
he said his father had just taken the house
he said he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood
he never suggested giving eleanor a cup of tea
dear lucy i am much worried and i advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother freddy and mr vyse who will forbid him to enter the house etc
that was a great misfortune and i dare say you have told them already
mr vyse is so sensitive
i remember how i used to get on his nerves at rome
i am very sorry about it all and should not feel easy unless i warned you
believe me your anxious and loving cousin charlotte lucy was much annoyed and replied as follows beauchamp mansions sw
dear charlotte many thanks for your warning
when mr emerson forgot himself on the mountain you made me promise not to tell mother because you said she would blame you for not being always with me
i have kept that promise and cannot possibly tell her now
i have said both to her and cecil that i met the emersons at florence and that they are respectable peoplewhich i do thinkand the reason that he offered miss lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself
she should have tried at the rectory
i cannot begin making a fuss at this stage
you must see that it would be too absurd
if the emersons heard i had complained of them they would think themselves of importance which is exactly what they are not
i like the old father and look forward to seeing him again
as for the son i am sorry for him when we meet rather than for myself
they are known to cecil who is very well and spoke of you the other day
we expect to be married in january
miss lavish cannot have told you much about me for i am not at windy corner at all but here
please do not put private outside your envelope again
no one opens my letters
yours affectionately l
m honeychurch secrecy has this disadvantage we lose the sense of proportion we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not
were lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy cecils life if he discovered it or with a little thing which he would laugh at
miss bartlett suggested the former
perhaps she was right
it had become a great thing now
left to herself lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously and it would have remained a little thing
emerson not harris it was only that a few weeks ago
she tried to tell cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school
but her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped
she and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on
it did her no harm cecil thought to learn the framework of society while society itself was absent on the golflinks or the moors
the weather was cool and it did her no harm
in spite of the season mrs vyse managed to scrape together a dinnerparty consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people
the food was poor but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl
one was tired of everything it seemed
one launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter
in this atmosphere the pension bertolini and windy corner appeared equally crude and lucy saw that her london career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past
the grandchildren asked her to play the piano
she played schumann
now some beethoven called cecil when the querulous beauty of the music had died
she shook her head and played schumann again
the melody rose unprofitably magical
it broke it was resumed broken not marching once from the cradle to the grave
the sadness of the incompletethe sadness that is often life but should never be artthrobbed in its disjected phrases and made the nerves of the audience throb
not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the bertolini and too much schumann was not the remark that mr beebe had passed to himself when she returned
when the guests were gone and lucy had gone to bed mrs vyse paced up and down the drawingroom discussing her little party with her son
mrs vyse was a nice woman but her personality like many anothers had been swamped by london for it needs a strong head to live among many people
the too vast orb of her fate had crushed her and she had seen too many seasons too many cities too many men for her abilities and even with cecil she was mechanical and behaved as if he was not one son but so to speak a filial crowd
make lucy one of us she said looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence and straining her lips apart until she spoke again
lucy is becoming wonderfulwonderful her music always was wonderful yes but she is purging off the honeychurch taint most excellent honeychurches but you know what i mean
she is not always quoting servants or asking one how the pudding is made italy has done it perhaps she murmured thinking of the museum that represented italy to her
it is just possible
cecil mind you marry her next january
she is one of us already but her music he exclaimed
the style of her
how she kept to schumann when like an idiot i wanted beethoven
schumann was right for this evening
schumann was the thing
do you know mother i shall have our children educated just like lucy
bring them up among honest country folks for freshness send them to italy for subtlety and thennot till thenlet them come to london
i dont believe in these london educations he broke off remembering that he had had one himself and concluded at all events not for women make her one of us repeated mrs vyse and processed to bed
as she was dozing off a crythe cry of nightmarerang from lucys room
lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but mrs vyse thought it kind to go herself
she found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek
i am so sorry mrs vyseit is these dreams bad dreams just dreams the elder lady smiled and kissed her saying very distinctly you should have heard us talking about you dear
he admires you more than ever
dream of that lucy returned the kiss still covering one cheek with her hand
mrs vyse recessed to bed
cecil whom the cry had not awoke snored
darkness enveloped the flat
chapter xii twelfth chapter it was a saturday afternoon gay and brilliant after abundant rains and the spirit of youth dwelt in it though the season was now autumn
all that was gracious triumphed
as the motorcars passed through summer street they raised only a little dust and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines
mr beebe at leisure for lifes amenities leant over his rectory gate
freddy leant by him smoking a pendant pipe
suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little mm they might amuse you freddy whom his fellowcreatures never amused suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy and so on since they had only just moved in
i suggested we should hinder them said mr beebe
they are worth it unlatching the gate he sauntered over the triangular green to cissie villa
hullo he cried shouting in at the open door through which much squalor was visible
a grave voice replied hullo ive brought someone to see you ill be down in a minute the passage was blocked by a wardrobe which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs
mr beebe edged round it with difficulty
the sittingroom itself was blocked with books
are these people great readers freddy whispered
are they that sort i fancy they know how to reada rare accomplishment
what have they got
byron
exactly
a shropshire lad
never heard of it
the way of all flesh
never heard of it
gibbon
hullo
dear george reads german
umumschopenhauer nietzsche and so we go on
well i suppose your generation knows its own business honeychurch mr
beebe look at that said freddy in awestruck tones
on the cornice of the wardrobe the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes i know
isnt it jolly
i like that
im certain thats the old mans doing how very odd of him surely you agree but freddy was his mothers son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture
pictures the clergyman continued scrambling about the room
giottothey got that at florence ill be bound the same as lucys got oh bytheby did miss honeychurch enjoy london she came back yesterday i suppose she had a good time yes very said freddy taking up a book
she and cecil are thicker than ever thats good hearing i wish i wasnt such a fool mr beebe mr beebe ignored the remark
lucy used to be nearly as stupid as i am but itll be very different now mother thinks
she will read all kinds of books so will you only medical books
not books that you can talk about afterwards
cecil is teaching lucy italian and he says her playing is wonderful
there are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed
cecil says what on earth are those people doing upstairs
emersonwe think well come another time george ran downstairs and pushed them into the room without speaking
let me introduce mr honeychurch a neighbour then freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth
perhaps he was shy perhaps he was friendly or perhaps he thought that georges face wanted washing
at all events he greeted him with how dye do
come and have a bathe oh all right said george impassive
mr beebe was highly entertained
how dye do
how dye do
come and have a bathe he chuckled
thats the best conversational opening ive ever heard
but im afraid it will only act between men
can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with how do you do
come and have a bathe
and yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal i tell you that they shall be said mr emerson who had been slowly descending the stairs
good afternoon mr beebe
i tell you they shall be comrades and george thinks the same we are to raise ladies to our level the clergyman inquired
the garden of eden pursued mr emerson still descending which you place in the past is really yet to come
we shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies mr beebe disclaimed placing the garden of eden anywhere
in thisnot in other thingswe men are ahead
we despise the body less than women do
but not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden i say what about this bathe murmured freddy appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him
i believed in a return to nature once
but how can we return to nature when we have never been with her
today i believe that we must discover nature
after many conquests we shall attain simplicity
it is our heritage let me introduce mr honeychurch whose sister you will remember at florence how do you do
very glad to see you and that you are taking george for a bathe
very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry
marriage is a duty
i am sure that she will be happy for we know mr vyse too
he has been most kind
he met us by chance in the national gallery and arranged everything about this delightful house
though i hope i have not vexed sir harry otway
i have met so few liberal landowners and i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the conservative attitude
ah this wind
you do well to bathe
yours is a glorious country honeychurch not a bit mumbled freddy
i mustthat is to say i have tohave the pleasure of calling on you later on my mother says i hope call my lad
who taught us that drawingroom twaddle
call on your grandmother
listen to the wind among the pines
yours is a glorious country mr beebe came to the rescue
mr
emerson he will call i shall call you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed
i trust that you have realized about the ten days interval
it does not count that i helped you with the staireyes yesterday
it does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon yes go and bathe george
why do you dawdle talking
bring them back to tea
bring back some milk cakes honey
the change will do you good
george has been working very hard at his office
i cant believe hes well george bowed his head dusty and sombre exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture
do you really want this bathe freddy asked him
it is only a pond dont you know
i dare say you are used to something better yesi have said yes already mr beebe felt bound to assist his young friend and led the way out of the house and into the pinewoods
how glorious it was
for a little time the voice of old mr emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy
it ceased and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees
mr beebe who could be silent but who could not bear silence was compelled to chatter since the expedition looked like a failure and neither of his companions would utter a word
he spoke of florence
george attended gravely assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the treetops above their heads
and what a coincidence that you should meet mr vyse
did you realize that you would find all the pension bertolini down here i did not
miss lavish told me when i was a young man i always meant to write a history of coincidence no enthusiasm
though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose
for example it isnt purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect to his relief george began to talk
it is
i have reflected
it is fate
everything is fate
we are flung together by fate drawn apart by fateflung together drawn apart
the twelve winds blow uswe settle nothing you have not reflected at all rapped the clergyman
let me give you a useful tip emerson attribute nothing to fate
dont say i didnt do this for you did it ten to one
now ill crossquestion you
where did you first meet miss honeychurch and myself italy and where did you meet mr vyse who is going to marry miss honeychurch national gallery looking at italian art
there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate
you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends
this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it it is fate that i am here persisted george
but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy mr beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject
but he was infinitely tolerant of the young and had no desire to snub george
and so for this and for other reasons my history of coincidence is still to write silence
wishing to round off the episode he added we are all so glad that you have come silence
here we are called freddy
oh good exclaimed mr beebe mopping his brow
in theres the pond
i wish it was bigger he added apologetically
they climbed down a slippery bank of pineneedles
there lay the pond set in its little alp of greenonly a pond but large enough to contain the human body and pure enough to reflect the sky
on account of the rains the waters had flooded the surrounding grass which showed like a beautiful emerald path tempting these feet towards the central pool
its distinctly successful as ponds go said mr beebe
no apologies are necessary for the pond george sat down where the ground was dry and drearily unlaced his boots
arent those masses of willowherb splendid
i love willowherb in seed
whats the name of this aromatic plant no one knew or seemed to care
these abrupt changes of vegetationthis little spongeous tract of water plants and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittleheather bracken hurts pines
very charming very charming mr
beebe arent you bathing called freddy as he stripped himself
mr beebe thought he was not
waters wonderful cried freddy prancing in
waters water murmured george
wetting his hair firsta sure sign of apathyhe followed freddy into the divine as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds
it was necessary to use his muscles
it was necessary to keep clean
mr beebe watched them and watched the seeds of the willowherb dance chorically above their heads
apooshoo apooshoo apooshoo went freddy swimming for two strokes in either direction and then becoming involved in reeds or mud
is it worth it asked the other michelangelesque on the flooded margin
the bank broke away and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly
heepoofive swallowed a pollywog mr beebe waters wonderful waters simply ripping waters not so bad said george reappearing from his plunge and sputtering at the sun
waters wonderful
mr beebe do apooshoo kouf mr beebe who was hot and who always acquiesced where possible looked around him
he could detect no parishioners except the pinetrees rising up steeply on all sides and gesturing to each other against the blue
how glorious it was
the world of motorcars and rural deans receded inimitably
water sky evergreens a windthese things not even the seasons can touch and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man
i may as well wash too and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward and he too asserted the wonder of the water
it was ordinary water nor was there very much of it and as freddy said it reminded one of swimming in a salad
the three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high after the fashion of the nymphs in gtterdmmerung
but either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spiritfor some reason or other a change came over them and they forgot italy and botany and fate
they began to play
mr beebe and freddy splashed each other
a little deferentially they splashed george
he was quiet they feared they had offended him
then all the forces of youth burst out
he smiled flung himself at them splashed them ducked them kicked them muddied them and drove them out of the pool
race you round it then cried freddy and they raced in the sunshine and george took a short cut and dirtied his shins and had to bathe a second time
then mr beebe consented to runa memorable sight
they ran to get dry they bathed to get cool they played at being indians in the willowherbs and in the bracken they bathed to get clean
and all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward proclaiming no
we are what matters
without us shall no enterprise begin
to us shall all flesh turn in the end a try
a try yelled freddy snatching up georges bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goalpost
socker rules george retorted scattering freddys bundle with a kick
goal goal pass take care my watch cried mr beebe
clothes flew in all directions
take care my hat
no thats enough freddy
dress now
no i say but the two young men were delirious
away they twinkled into the trees freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm george with a wideawake hat on his dripping hair
thatll do shouted mr beebe remembering that after all he was in his own parish
then his voice changed as if every pinetree was a rural dean
hi
steady on
i see people coming you fellows yells and widening circles over the dappled earth
hi
hi
ladies neither george nor freddy was truly refined
still they did not hear mr beebes last warning or they would have avoided mrs honeychurch cecil and lucy who were walking down to call on old mrs butterworth
freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet and dashed into some bracken
george whooped in their faces turned and scudded away down the path to the pond still clad in mr beebes hat
gracious alive cried mrs honeychurch
whoever were those unfortunate people
oh dears look away
and poor mr beebe too
whatever has happened come this way immediately commanded cecil who always felt that he must lead women though he knew not whither and protect them though he knew not against what
he led them now towards the bracken where freddy sat concealed
oh poor mr beebe
was that his waistcoat we left in the path
cecil mr beebes waistcoat no business of ours said cecil glancing at lucy who was all parasol and evidently minded i fancy mr beebe jumped back into the pond this way please mrs honeychurch this way they followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions
well i cant help it said a voice close ahead and freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds
i cant be trodden on can i good gracious me dear so its you
what miserable management
why not have a comfortable bath at home with hot and cold laid on look here mother a fellow must wash and a fellows got to dry and if another fellow dear no doubt youre right as usual but you are in no position to argue
come lucy they turned
oh lookdont look
oh poor mr beebe
how unfortunate again for mr beebe was just crawling out of the pond on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float while george the worldweary george shouted to freddy that he had hooked a fish
and me ive swallowed one answered he of the bracken
ive swallowed a pollywog
it wriggleth in my tummy
i shall dieemerson you beast youve got on my bags hush dears said mrs honeychurch who found it impossible to remain shocked
and do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first
all these colds come of not drying thoroughly mother do come away said lucy
oh for goodness sake do come hullo cried george so that again the ladies stopped
he regarded himself as dressed
barefoot barechested radiant and personable against the shadowy woods he called hullo miss honeychurch
hullo bow lucy better bow
whoever is it
i shall bow miss honeychurch bowed
that evening and all that night the water ran away
on the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory
it had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will a passing benediction whose influence did not pass a holiness a spell a momentary chalice for youth
chapter xiii how miss bartletts boiler was so tiresome how often had lucy rehearsed this bow this interview
but she had always rehearsed them indoors and with certain accessories which surely we have a right to assume
who could foretell that she and george would meet in the rout of a civilization amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth
she had imagined a young mr emerson who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent
she was prepared for all of these
but she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star
indoors herself partaking of tea with old mrs butterworth she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy that it is impossible to rehearse life
a fault in the scenery a face in the audience an irruption of the audience on to the stage and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing or mean too much
i will bow she had thought
i will not shake hands with him
that will be just the proper thing she had bowedbut to whom
to gods to heroes to the nonsense of schoolgirls
she had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world
so ran her thoughts while her faculties were busy with cecil
it was another of those dreadful engagement calls
mrs butterworth had wanted to see him and he did not want to be seen
he did not want to hear about hydrangeas why they change their colour at the seaside
he did not want to join the c o s when cross he was always elaborate and made long clever answers where yes or no would have done
lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace
no one is perfect and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock
miss bartlett indeed though not in word had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory
lucy though she disliked the teacher regarded the teaching as profound and applied it to her lover
lucy said her mother when they got home is anything the matter with cecil the question was ominous up till now mrs honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint
no i dont think so mother cecils all right perhaps hes tired lucy compromised perhaps cecil was a little tired
because otherwiseshe pulled out her bonnetpins with gathering displeasurebecause otherwise i cannot account for him i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that cecil has told you to think so
you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever
noit is just the same thing everywhere let me just put your bonnet away may i surely he could answer her civilly for one halfhour cecil has a very high standard for people faltered lucy seeing trouble ahead
its part of his idealsit is really that that makes him sometimes seem oh rubbish
if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better said mrs honeychurch handing her the bonnet
now mother
ive seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself not in that way
at times i could wring her neck
but not in that way
no
it is the same with cecil all over bythebyi never told you
i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london this attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile and mrs honeychurch resented it
since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him
whenever i speak he wincesi see him lucy it is useless to contradict me
no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawingroom furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember ii see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtnt to
but he does not mean to be uncivilhe once explainedit is the things that upset himhe is easily upset by ugly thingshe is not uncivil to people is it a thing or a person when freddy sings you cant expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do then why didnt he leave the room
why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyones pleasure we mustnt be unjust to people faltered lucy
something had enfeebled her and the case for cecil which she had mastered so perfectly in london would not come forth in an effective form
the two civilizations had clashedcecil hinted that they mightand she was dazzled and bewildered as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes
good taste and bad taste were only catchwords garments of diverse cut and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pinetrees where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song
she remained in much embarrassment while mrs honeychurch changed her frock for dinner and every now and then she said a word and made things no better
there was no concealing the fact cecil had meant to be supercilious and he had succeeded
and lucyshe knew not whywished that the trouble could have come at any other time
go and dress dear youll be late all right mother dont say all right and stop
go she obeyed but loitered disconsolately at the landing window
it faced north so there was little view and no view of the sky
now as in the winter the pinetrees hung close to her eyes
one connected the landing window with depression
no definite problem menaced her but she sighed to herself oh dear what shall i do what shall i do it seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly
and she ought not to have mentioned miss bartletts letter
she must be more careful her mother was rather inquisitive and might have asked what it was about
oh dear what should she doand then freddy came bounding upstairs and joined the ranks of the illbehaved
i say those are topping people my dear baby how tiresome youve been
you have no business to take them bathing in the sacred lake its much too public
it was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else
do be more careful
you forget the place is growing half suburban i say is anything on tomorrow week not that i know of then i want to ask the emersons up to sunday tennis oh i wouldnt do that freddy i wouldnt do that with all this muddle whats wrong with the court
they wont mind a bump or two and ive ordered new balls i meant its better not
i really mean it he seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage
she pretended not to mind but she could have screamed with temper
cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded mary with her brood of hotwater cans
then mrs honeychurch opened her door and said lucy what a noise youre making
i have something to say to you
did you say you had had a letter from charlotte and freddy ran away
yes
i really cant stop
i must dress too hows charlotte all right lucy the unfortunate girl returned
youve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of ones sentences
did charlotte mention her boiler her what dont you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible todoings i cant remember all charlottes worries said lucy bitterly
i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil mrs honeychurch might have flamed out
she did not
she said come here old ladythank you for putting away my bonnetkiss me and though nothing is perfect lucy felt for the moment that her mother and windy corner and the weald in the declining sun were perfect
so the grittiness went out of life
it generally did at windy corner
at the last minute when the social machine was clogged hopelessly one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil
cecil despised their methodsperhaps rightly
at all events they were not his own
dinner was at halfpast seven
freddy gabbled the grace and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to
fortunately the men were hungry
nothing untoward occurred until the pudding
then freddy said lucy whats emerson like i saw him in florence said lucy hoping that this would pass for a reply
is he the clever sort or is he a decent chap ask cecil it is cecil who brought him here he is the clever sort like myself said cecil
freddy looked at him doubtfully
how well did you know them at the bertolini asked mrs honeychurch
oh very slightly
i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did oh that reminds meyou never told me what charlotte said in her letter one thing and another said lucy wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie
among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if shed come up and see us and mercifully didnt lucy i do call the way you talk unkind she was a novelist said lucy craftily
the remark was a happy one for nothing roused mrs honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females
she would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who instead of minding their houses and their children seek notoriety by print
her attitude was if books must be written let them be written by men and she developed it at great length while cecil yawned and freddy played at this year next year now never with his plumstones and lucy artfully fed the flames of her mothers wrath
but soon the conflagration died down and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness
there were too many ghosts about
the original ghostthat touch of lips on her cheekhad surely been laid long ago it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once
but it had begotten a spectral familymr
harris miss bartletts letter mr beebes memories of violetsand one or other of these was bound to haunt her before cecils very eyes
it was miss bartlett who returned now and with appalling vividness
i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlottes
how is she i tore the thing up didnt she say how she was
how does she sound
cheerful oh yes i suppose sononot very cheerful i suppose then depend upon it it is the boiler
i know myself how water preys upon ones mind
i would rather anything elseeven a misfortune with the meat cecil laid his hand over his eyes
so would i asserted freddy backing his mother upbacking up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance
and i have been thinking she added rather nervously surely we could squeeze charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at tunbridge wells finish
i have not seen poor charlotte for so long it was more than her nerves could stand
and she could not protest violently after her mothers goodness to her upstairs
mother no she pleaded
its impossible
we cant have charlotte on the top of the other things were squeezed to death as it is
freddys got a friend coming tuesday theres cecil and youve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare
it simply cant be done nonsense
it can if minnie sleeps in the bath
not otherwise minnie can sleep with you i wont have her then if youre so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett moaned cecil again laying his hand over his eyes
its impossible repeated lucy
i dont want to make difficulties but it really isnt fair on the maids to fill up the house so alas
the truth is dear you dont like charlotte no i dont
and no more does cecil
she gets on our nerves
you havent seen her lately and dont realize how tiresome she can be though so good
so please mother dont worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come hear hear said cecil
mrs honeychurch with more gravity than usual and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself replied this isnt very kind of you two
you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers
you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old cecil crumbled his bread
i must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on my bike put in freddy
she thanked me for coming till i felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right i know dear
she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return but lucy hardened her heart
it was no good being kind to miss bartlett
she had tried herself too often and too recently
one might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt but one enriched neither miss bartlett nor any one else upon earth
she was reduced to saying i cant help it mother
i dont like charlotte
i admit its horrid of me from your own account you told her as much well she would leave florence so stupidly
she flurried the ghosts were returning they filled italy they were even usurping the places she had known as a child
the sacred lake would never be the same again and on sunday week something would even happen to windy corner
how would she fight against ghosts
for a moment the visible world faded away and memories and emotions alone seemed real
i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well said cecil who was in rather a happier frame of mind thanks to the admirable cooking
i didnt mean the egg was well boiled corrected freddy because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i dont care for eggs
i only meant how jolly kind she seemed cecil frowned again
oh these honeychurches
eggs boilers hydrangeas maidsof such were their lives compact
may me and lucy get down from our chairs he asked with scarcely veiled insolence
we dont want no dessert chapter xiv how lucy faced the external situation bravely of course miss bartlett accepted
and equally of course she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance and begged to be given an inferior spare roomsomething with no view anything
her love to lucy
and equally of course george emerson could come to tennis on the sunday week
lucy faced the situation bravely though like most of us she only faced the situation that encompassed her
she never gazed inwards
if at times strange images rose from the depths she put them down to nerves
when cecil brought the emersons to summer street it had upset her nerves
charlotte would burnish up past foolishness and this might upset her nerves
she was nervous at night
when she talked to georgethey met again almost immediately at the rectoryhis voice moved her deeply and she wished to remain near him
how dreadful if she really wished to remain near him
of course the wish was due to nerves which love to play such perverse tricks upon us
once she had suffered from things that came out of nothing and meant she didnt know what now cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed
it is obvious enough for the reader to conclude she loves young emerson a reader in lucys place would not find it obvious
life is easy to chronicle but bewildering to practice and we welcome nerves or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire
she loved cecil george made her nervous will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed
but the external situationshe will face that bravely
the meeting at the rectory had passed off well enough
standing between mr beebe and cecil she had made a few temperate allusions to italy and george had replied
she was anxious to show that she was not shy and was glad that he did not seem shy either
a nice fellow said mr beebe afterwards he will work off his crudities in time
i rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully lucy said he seems in better spirits
he laughs more yes replied the clergyman
he is waking up that was all
but as the week wore on more of her defences fell and she entertained an image that had physical beauty
in spite of the clearest directions miss bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival
she was due at the southeastern station at dorking whither mrs honeychurch drove to meet her
she arrived at the london and brighton station and had to hire a cab up
no one was at home except freddy and his friend who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour
cecil and lucy turned up at four oclock and these with little minnie beebe made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea
i shall never forgive myself said miss bartlett who kept on rising from her seat and had to be begged by the united company to remain
i have upset everything
bursting in on young people
but i insist on paying for my cab up
grant that at any rate our visitors never do such dreadful things said lucy while her brother in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial exclaimed in irritable tones just what ive been trying to convince cousin charlotte of lucy for the last half hour i do not feel myself an ordinary visitor said miss bartlett and looked at her frayed glove
all right if youd really rather
five shillings and i gave a bob to the driver miss bartlett looked in her purse
only sovereigns and pennies
could any one give her change
freddy had half a quid and his friend had four halfcrowns
miss bartlett accepted their moneys and then said but who am i to give the sovereign to lets leave it all till mother comes back suggested lucy
no dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me
we all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts here freddys friend mr floyd made the one remark of his that need be quoted he offered to toss freddy for miss bartletts quid
a solution seemed in sight and even cecil who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view felt the eternal attraction of chance and turned round
but this did not do either
pleasepleasei know i am a sad spoilsport but it would make me wretched
i should practically be robbing the one who lost freddy owes me fifteen shillings interposed cecil
so it will work out right if you give the pound to me fifteen shillings said miss bartlett dubiously
how is that mr vyse because dont you see freddy paid your cab
give me the pound and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling miss bartlett who was poor at figures became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths
for a moment cecil was happy
he was playing at nonsense among his peers
then he glanced at lucy in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles
in january he would rescue his leonardo from this stupefying twaddle
but i dont see that exclaimed minnie beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction
i dont see why mr vyse is to have the quid because of the fifteen shillings and the five they said solemnly
fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound you see but i dont see they tried to stifle her with cake
no thank you
im done
i dont see whyfreddy dont poke me
miss honeychurch your brothers hurting me
ow
what about mr floyds ten shillings
ow
no i dont see and i never shall see why miss whatshername shouldnt pay that bob for the driver i had forgotten the driver said miss bartlett reddening
thank you dear for reminding me
a shilling was it
can any one give me change for half a crown ill get it said the young hostess rising with decision
cecil give me that sovereign
no give me up that sovereign
ill get euphemia to change it and well start the whole thing again from the beginning lucylucywhat a nuisance i am protested miss bartlett and followed her across the lawn
lucy tripped ahead simulating hilarity
when they were out of earshot miss bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly have you told him about him yet no i havent replied lucy and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant
let me seea sovereigns worth of silver she escaped into the kitchen
miss bartletts sudden transitions were too uncanny
it sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul
no i havent told cecil or any one she remarked when she returned
i promised you i shouldnt
here is your moneyall shillings except two halfcrowns
would you count it
you can settle your debt nicely now miss bartlett was in the drawingroom gazing at the photograph of st john ascending which had been framed
how dreadful she murmured how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source oh no charlotte said the girl entering the battle
george emerson is all right and what other source is there miss bartlett considered
for instance the driver
i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth lucy shuddered a little
we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we arent careful
how could a florentine cabdriver ever get hold of cecil we must think of every possibility oh its all right or perhaps old mr emerson knows
in fact he is certain to know i dont care if he does
i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it to contradict it no to laugh at it but she knew in her heart that she could not trust him for he desired her untouched
very well dear you know best
perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young
ladies are certainly different now charlotte she struck at her playfully
you kind anxious thing
what would you have me do
first you say dont tell and then you say tell
which is it to be
quick miss bartlett sighed i am no match for you in conversation dearest
i blush when i think how i interfered at florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than i am
you will never forgive me shall we go out then
they will smash all the china if we dont for the air rang with the shrieks of minnie who was being scalped with a teaspoon
dear one momentwe may not have this chance for a chat again
have you seen the young one yet yes i have what happened we met at the rectory what line is he taking up no line
he talked about italy like any other person
it is really all right
what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly
i do wish i could make you see it my way
he really wont be any nuisance charlotte once a cad always a cad
that is my poor opinion lucy paused
cecil said one dayand i thought it so profoundthat there are two kinds of cadsthe conscious and the subconscious she paused again to be sure of doing justice to cecils profundity
through the window she saw cecil himself turning over the pages of a novel
it was a new one from smiths library
her mother must have returned from the station
once a cad always a cad droned miss bartlett
what i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head
i fell into all those violets and he was silly and surprised
i dont think we ought to blame him very much
it makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly
it really does it makes an enormous difference and he lost his head he doesnt admire me or any of that nonsense one straw
freddy rather likes him and has asked him up here on sunday so you can judge for yourself
he has improved he doesnt always look as if hes going to burst into tears
he is a clerk in the general managers office at one of the big railwaysnot a porter
and runs down to his father for weekends
papa was to do with journalism but is rheumatic and has retired
there
now for the garden she took hold of her guest by the arm
suppose we dont talk about this silly italian business any more
we want you to have a nice restful visit at windy corner with no worriting lucy thought this rather a good speech
the reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it
whether miss bartlett detected the slip one cannot say for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people
she might have spoken further but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess
explanations took place and in the midst of them lucy escaped the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain
chapter xv the disaster within the sunday after miss bartletts arrival was a glorious day like most of the days of that year
in the weald autumn approached breaking up the green monotony of summer touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist the beechtrees with russet the oaktrees with gold
up on the heights battalions of black pines witnessed the change themselves unchangeable
either country was spanned by a cloudless sky and in either arose the tinkle of church bells
the garden of windy corners was deserted except for a red book which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path
from the house came incoherent sounds as of females preparing for worship
the men say they wont gowell i dont blame themminnie says need she gotell her no nonsenseanne
mary
hook me behinddearest lucia may i trespass upon you for a pin for miss bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church
the sun rose higher on its journey guided not by phaethon but by apollo competent unswerving divine
its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows on mr beebe down at summer street as he smiled over a letter from miss catharine alan on george emerson cleaning his fathers boots and lastly to complete the catalogue of memorable things on the red book mentioned previously
the ladies move mr beebe moves george moves and movement may engender shadow
but this book lies motionless to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly as though acknowledging the caress
presently lucy steps out of the drawingroom window
her new cerise dress has been a failure and makes her look tawdry and wan
at her throat is a garnet brooch on her finger a ring set with rubiesan engagement ring
her eyes are bent to the weald
she frowns a littlenot in anger but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry
in all that expanse no human eye is looking at her and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between apollo and the western hills
lucy
lucy
whats that book
whos been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil its only the library book that cecils been reading but pick it up and dont stand idling there like a flamingo lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly under a loggia
she no longer read novels herself devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching cecil up
it was dreadful how little she knew and even when she thought she knew a thing like the italian painters she found she had forgotten it
only this morning she had confused francesco francia with piero della francesca and cecil had said what
you arent forgetting your italy already and this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground and above them scarcely conceivable elsewhere the dear sun
lucyhave you a sixpence for minnie and a shilling for yourself she hastened in to her mother who was rapidly working herself into a sunday fluster
its a special collectioni forget what for
i do beg no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies see that minnie has a nice bright sixpence
where is the child
minnie
that books all warped
gracious how plain you look
put it under the atlas to press
minnie oh mrs honeychurch from the upper regions
minnie dont be late
here comes the horseit was always the horse never the carriage
wheres charlotte
run up and hurry her
why is she so long
she had nothing to do
she never brings anything but blouses
poor charlottehow i do detest blouses
minnie paganism is infectiousmore infectious than diphtheria or pietyand the rectors niece was taken to church protesting
as usual she didnt see why
why shouldnt she sit in the sun with the young men
the young men who had now appeared mocked her with ungenerous words
mrs honeychurch defended orthodoxy and in the midst of the confusion miss bartlett dressed in the very height of the fashion came strolling down the stairs
dear marian i am very sorry but i have no small changenothing but sovereigns and half crowns
could any one give me yes easily
jump in
gracious me how smart you look
what a lovely frock
you put us all to shame if i did not wear my best rags and tatters now when should i wear them said miss bartlett reproachfully
she got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse
the necessary roar ensued and then they drove off
goodbye
be good called out cecil
lucy bit her lip for the tone was sneering
on the subject of church and so on they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation
he had said that people ought to overhaul themselves and she did not want to overhaul herself she did not know it was done
honest orthodoxy cecil respected but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis he could not imagine it as a natural birthright that might grow heavenward like flowers
all that he said on this subject pained her though he exuded tolerance from every pore somehow the emersons were different
she saw the emersons after church
there was a line of carriages down the road and the honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite cissie villa
to save time they walked over the green to it and found father and son smoking in the garden
introduce me said her mother
unless the young man considers that he knows me already he probably did but lucy ignored the sacred lake and introduced them formally
old mr emerson claimed her with much warmth and said how glad he was that she was going to be married
she said yes she was glad too and then as miss bartlett and minnie were lingering behind with mr beebe she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic and asked him how he liked his new house
very much he replied but there was a note of offence in his voice she had never known him offended before
he added we find though that the miss alans were coming and that we have turned them out
women mind such a thing
i am very much upset about it i believe that there was some misunderstanding said mrs honeychurch uneasily
our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person said george who seemed disposed to carry the matter further
he thought we should be artistic
he is disappointed and i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to give it up
what do you think he appealed to lucy
oh stop now you have come said lucy lightly
she must avoid censuring cecil
for it was on cecil that the little episode turned though his name was never mentioned
so george says
he says that the miss alans must go to the wall
yet it does seem so unkind there is only a certain amount of kindness in the world said george watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages
yes exclaimed mrs honeychurch
thats exactly what i say
why all this twiddling and twaddling over two miss alans there is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light he continued in measured tones
we cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows
choose a place where you wont do harmyes choose a place where you wont do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine oh mr emerson i see youre clever eh i see youre going to be clever
i hope you didnt go behaving like that to poor freddy georges eyes laughed and lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well
no i didnt he said
he behaved that way to me
it is his philosophy
only he starts life with it and i have tried the note of interrogation first what do you mean
no never mind what you mean
dont explain
he looks forward to seeing you this afternoon
do you play tennis
do you mind tennis on sunday george mind tennis on sunday
george after his education distinguish between sunday very well george doesnt mind tennis on sunday
no more do i thats settled
mr emerson if you could come with your son we should be so pleased he thanked her but the walk sounded rather far he could only potter about in these days
she turned to george and then he wants to give up his house to the miss alans i know said george and put his arm round his fathers neck
the kindness that mr beebe and lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly like sunlight touching a vast landscapea touch of the morning sun
she remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection
miss bartlett approached
you know our cousin miss bartlett said mrs honeychurch pleasantly
you met her with my daughter in florence yes indeed said the old man and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady
miss bartlett promptly got into the victoria
thus entrenched she emitted a formal bow
it was the pension bertolini again the diningtable with the decanters of water and wine
it was the old old battle of the room with the view
george did not respond to the bow
like any boy he blushed and was ashamed he knew that the chaperon remembered
he said iill come up to tennis if i can manage it and went into the house
perhaps anything that he did would have pleased lucy but his awkwardness went straight to her heart men were not gods after all but as human and as clumsy as girls even men might suffer from unexplained desires and need help
to one of her upbringing and of her destination the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar but she had surmised it at florence when george threw her photographs into the river arno
george dont go cried his father who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them
george has been in such good spirits today and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon lucy caught her cousins eye
something in its mute appeal made her reckless
yes she said raising her voice i do hope he will then she went to the carriage and murmured the old man hasnt been told i knew it was all right mrs honeychurch followed her and they drove away
satisfactory that mr emerson had not been told of the florence escapade yet lucys spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven
satisfactory yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy
all the way home the horses hoofs sang a tune to her he has not told he has not told her brain expanded the melody he has not told his fatherto whom he tells all things
it was not an exploit
he did not laugh at me when i had gone she raised her hand to her cheek
he does not love me
no
how terrible if he did
but he has not told
he will not tell she longed to shout the words it is all right
its a secret between us two for ever
cecil will never hear she was even glad that miss bartlett had made her promise secrecy that last dark evening at florence when they had knelt packing in his room
the secret big or little was guarded
only three english people knew of it in the world
thus she interpreted her joy
she greeted cecil with unusual radiance because she felt so safe
as he helped her out of the carriage she said the emersons have been so nice
george emerson has improved enormously how are my protgs asked cecil who took no real interest in them and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to windy corner for educational purposes
protgs she exclaimed with some warmth
for the only relationship which cecil conceived was feudal that of protector and protected
he had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girls soul yearned
you shall see for yourself how your protgs are
george emerson is coming up this afternoon
he is a most interesting man to talk to
only dont she nearly said dont protect him but the bell was ringing for lunch and as often happened cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks
charm not argument was to be her forte
lunch was a cheerful meal
generally lucy was depressed at meals
some one had to be soothedeither cecil or miss bartlett or a being not visible to the mortal eyea being who whispered to her soul it will not last this cheerfulness
in january you must go to london to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men but today she felt she had received a guarantee
her mother would always sit there her brother here
the sun though it had moved a little since the morning would never be hidden behind the western hills
after luncheon they asked her to play
she had seen glucks armide that year and played from memory the music of the enchanted gardenthe music to which renaud approaches beneath the light of an eternal dawn the music that never gains never wanes but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland
such music is not for the piano and her audience began to get restive and cecil sharing the discontent called out now play us the other gardenthe one in parsifal she closed the instrument
not very dutiful said her mothers voice
fearing that she had offended cecil she turned quickly round
there george was
he had crept in without interrupting her
oh i had no idea she exclaimed getting very red and then without a word of greeting she reopened the piano
cecil should have the parsifal and anything else that he liked
our performer has changed her mind said miss bartlett perhaps implying she will play the music to mr emerson
lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do
she played a few bars of the flower maidens song very badly and then she stopped
i vote tennis said freddy disgusted at the scrappy entertainment
yes so do i once more she closed the unfortunate piano
i vote you have a mens four all right not for me thank you said cecil
i will not spoil the set he never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth
oh come along cecil
im bad floyds rotten and so i dare says emerson george corrected him i am not bad one looked down ones nose at this
then certainly i wont play said cecil while miss bartlett under the impression that she was snubbing george added i agree with you mr vyse
you had much better not play
much better not minnie rushing in where cecil feared to tread announced that she would play
i shall miss every ball anyway so what does it matter but sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion
then it will have to be lucy said mrs honeychurch you must fall back on lucy
there is no other way out of it
lucy go and change your frock lucys sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature
she kept it without hypocrisy in the morning and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon
as she changed her frock she wondered whether cecil was sneering at her really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him
mr floyd was her partner
she liked music but how much better tennis seemed
how much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms
once more music appeared to her the employment of a child
george served and surprised her by his anxiety to win
she remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at santa croce because things wouldnt fit how after the death of that obscure italian he had leant over the parapet by the arno and said to her i shall want to live i tell you he wanted to live now to win at tennis to stand for all he was worth in the sunthe sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes and he did win
ah how beautiful the weald looked
the hills stood out above its radiance as fiesole stands above the tuscan plain and the south downs if one chose were the mountains of carrara
she might be forgetting her italy but she was noticing more things in her england
one could play a new game with the view and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for florence
ah how beautiful the weald looked
but now cecil claimed her
he chanced to be in a lucid critical mood and would not sympathize with exaltation
he had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others
he would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out i say listen to this lucy
three split infinitives dreadful said lucy and missed her stroke
when they had finished their set he still went on reading there was some murder scene and really everyone must listen to it
freddy and mr floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels but the other two acquiesced
the scene is laid in florence what fun cecil
read away
come mr emerson sit down after all your energy she had forgiven george as she put it and she made a point of being pleasant to him
he jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking youand are you tired of course im not do you mind being beaten she was going to answer no when it struck her that she did mind so she answered yes she added merrily i dont see youre such a splendid player though
the light was behind you and it was in my eyes i never said i was why you did you didnt attend you saidoh dont go in for accuracy at this house
we all exaggerate and we get very angry with people who dont the scene is laid in florence repeated cecil with an upward note
lucy recollected herself
sunset
leonora was speeding lucy interrupted
leonora
is leonora the heroine
whos the book by joseph emery prank
sunset
leonora speeding across the square
pray the saints she might not arrive too late
sunsetthe sunset of italy
under orcagnas loggiathe loggia de lanzi as we sometimes call it now lucy burst into laughter
joseph emery prank indeed
why its miss lavish
its miss lavishs novel and shes publishing it under somebody elses name who may miss lavish be oh a dreadful personmr
emerson you remember miss lavish excited by her pleasant afternoon she clapped her hands
george looked up
of course i do
i saw her the day i arrived at summer street
it was she who told me that you lived here werent you pleased she meant to see miss lavish but when he bent down to the grass without replying it struck her that she could mean something else
she watched his head which was almost resting against her knee and she thought that the ears were reddening
no wonder the novels bad she added
i never liked miss lavish
but i suppose one ought to read it as ones met her all modern books are bad said cecil who was annoyed at her inattention and vented his annoyance on literature
every one writes for money in these days oh cecil it is so
i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer cecil this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow
the ups and downs in his voice were noticeable but they did not affect her
she had dwelt amongst melody and movement and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his
leaving him to be annoyed she gazed at the black head again
she did not want to stroke it but she saw herself wanting to stroke it the sensation was curious
how do you like this view of ours mr emerson i never notice much difference in views what do you mean because theyre all alike
because all that matters in them is distance and air hm said cecil uncertain whether the remark was striking or not
my fatherhe looked up at her and he was a little flushedsays that there is only one perfect viewthe view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it i expect your father has been reading dante said cecil fingering the novel which alone permitted him to lead the conversation
he told us another day that views are really crowdscrowds of trees and houses and hillsand are bound to resemble each other like human crowdsand that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason lucys lips parted
for a crowd is more than the people who make it up
something gets added to itno one knows howjust as something has got added to those hills he pointed with his racquet to the south downs
what a splendid idea she murmured
i shall enjoy hearing your father talk again
im so sorry hes not so well no he isnt well theres an absurd account of a view in this book said cecil
also that men fall into two classesthose who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms mr
emerson have you any brothers or sisters none
why you spoke of us my mother i was meaning cecil closed the novel with a bang
oh cecilhow you made me jump i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer i can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as hindhead
it is the first thing that i remember cecil got up the man was illbredhe hadnt put on his coat after tennishe didnt do
he would have strolled away if lucy had not stopped him
cecil do read the thing about the view not while mr emerson is here to entertain us noread away
i think nothings funnier than to hear silly things read out loud
if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go this struck cecil as subtle and pleased him
it put their visitor in the position of a prig
somewhat mollified he sat down again
mr
emerson go and find tennis balls she opened the book
cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked
but her attention wandered to georges mother whoaccording to mr eagerhad been murdered in the sight of god andaccording to her sonhad seen as far as hindhead
am i really to go asked george
no of course not really she answered
chapter two said cecil yawning
find me chapter two if it isnt bothering you chapter two was found and she glanced at its opening sentences
she thought she had gone mad
herehand me the book she heard her voice saying it isnt worth readingits too silly to readi never saw such rubbishit oughtnt to be allowed to be printed he took the book from her
leonora he read sat pensive and alone
before her lay the rich champaign of tuscany dotted over with many a smiling village
the season was spring miss lavish knew somehow and had printed the past in draggled prose for cecil to read and for george to hear
a golden haze he read
he read afar off the towers of florence while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets
all unobserved antonio stole up behind her lest cecil should see her face she turned to george and saw his face
he read there came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use
no eloquence was his nor did he suffer from the lack of it
he simply enfolded her in his manly arms this isnt the passage i wanted he informed them there is another much funnier further on he turned over the leaves
should we go in to tea said lucy whose voice remained steady
she led the way up the garden cecil following her george last
she thought a disaster was averted
but when they entered the shrubbery it came
the book as if it had not worked mischief enough had been forgotten and cecil must go back for it and george who loved passionately must blunder against her in the narrow path
no she gasped and for the second time was kissed by him
as if no more was possible he slipped back cecil rejoined her they reached the upper lawn alone
chapter xvi lying to george but lucy had developed since the spring
that is to say she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove
though the danger was greater she was not shaken by deep sobs
she said to cecil i am not coming in to teatell motheri must write some letters and went up to her room
then she prepared for action
love felt and returned love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet reappeared now as the worlds enemy and she must stifle it
she sent for miss bartlett
the contest lay not between love and duty
perhaps there never is such a contest
it lay between the real and the pretended and lucys first aim was to defeat herself
as her brain clouded over as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves
she conquered her breakdown tampering with the truth she forgot that the truth had ever been
remembering that she was engaged to cecil she compelled herself to confused remembrances of george he was nothing to her he never had been anything he had behaved abominably she had never encouraged him
the armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness and hides a man not only from others but from his own soul
in a few moments lucy was equipped for battle
something too awful has happened she began as soon as her cousin arrived
do you know anything about miss lavishs novel miss bartlett looked surprised and said that she had not read the book nor known that it was published eleanor was a reticent woman at heart
there is a scene in it
the hero and heroine make love
do you know about that dear do you know about it please she repeated
they are on a hillside and florence is in the distance my good lucia i am all at sea
i know nothing about it whatever there are violets
i cannot believe it is a coincidence
charlotte charlotte how could you have told her
i have thought before speaking it must be you told her what she asked with growing agitation
about that dreadful afternoon in february miss bartlett was genuinely moved
oh lucy dearest girlshe hasnt put that in her book lucy nodded
not so that one could recognize it
yes then nevernevernever more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine so you did tell i did just happenwhen i had tea with her at romein the course of conversation but charlottewhat about the promise you gave me when we were packing
why did you tell miss lavish when you wouldnt even let me tell mother i will never forgive eleanor
she has betrayed my confidence why did you tell her though
this is a most serious thing why does any one tell anything
the question is eternal and it was not surprising that miss bartlett should only sigh faintly in response
she had done wrongshe admitted it she only hoped that she had not done harm she had told eleanor in the strictest confidence
lucy stamped with irritation
cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again
behind cecils back
ugh
is it possible that men are such brutes
behind cecils back as we were walking up the garden miss bartlett burst into selfaccusations and regrets
what is to be done now
can you tell me oh lucyi shall never forgive myself never to my dying day
fancy if your prospects i know said lucy wincing at the word
i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by some other source you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable it was miss bartletts turn to wince
however said the girl despising her cousins shiftiness whats dones done
you have put me in a most awkward position
how am i to get out of it miss bartlett could not think
the days of her energy were over
she was a visitor not a chaperon and a discredited visitor at that
she stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage
he mustthat man must have such a setting down that he wont forget
and whos to give it him
i cant tell mother nowowing to you
nor cecil charlotte owing to you
i am caught up every way
i think i shall go mad
i have no one to help me
thats why ive sent for you
whats wanted is a man with a whip miss bartlett agreed one wanted a man with a whip
yesbut its no good agreeing
whats to be done we women go maundering on
what does a girl do when she comes across a cad i always said he was a cad dear
give me credit for that at all events
from the very first momentwhen he said his father was having a bath oh bother the credit and whos been right or wrong
weve both made a muddle of it
george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isnt he
i want to know miss bartlett was absolutely helpless
her own exposure had unnerved her and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain
she moved feebly to the window and tried to detect the cads white flannels among the laurels
you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome
cant you speak again to him now willingly would i move heaven and earth i want something more definite said lucy contemptuously
will you speak to him
it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine really charlotte was outdoing herself
yes or no please yes or no it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle george emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand
very well said lucy with an angry gesture
no one will help me
i will speak to him myself and immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along
hullo emerson called freddy from below
found the lost ball
good man
want any tea and there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace
oh lucy but that is brave of you
i admire you they had gathered round george who beckoned she felt over the rubbish the sloppy thoughts the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul
her anger faded at the sight of him
ah
the emersons were fine people in their way
she had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying freddy has taken him into the diningroom
the others are going down the garden
come
let us get this over quickly
come
i want you in the room of course lucy do you mind doing it how can you ask such a ridiculous question poor lucy she stretched out her hand
i seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever i go lucy nodded
she remembered their last evening at florencethe packing the candle the shadow of miss bartletts toque on the door
she was not to be trapped by pathos a second time
eluding her cousins caress she led the way downstairs
try the jam freddy was saying
the jams jolly good george looking big and dishevelled was pacing up and down the diningroom
as she entered he stopped and said nonothing to eat you go down to the others said lucy charlotte and i will give mr emerson all he wants
wheres mother shes started on her sunday writing
shes in the drawingroom thats all right
you go away he went off singing
lucy sat down at the table
miss bartlett who was thoroughly frightened took up a book and pretended to read
she would not be drawn into an elaborate speech
she just said i cant have it mr emerson
i cannot even talk to you
go out of this house and never come into it again as long as i live here flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door
i hate a row
go please what no discussion but i cant she shook her head
go please
i do not want to call in mr vyse you dont mean he said absolutely ignoring miss bartlettyou dont mean that you are going to marry that man the line was unexpected
she shrugged her shoulders as if his vulgarity wearied her
you are merely ridiculous she said quietly
then his words rose gravely over hers you cannot live with vyse
hes only for an acquaintance
he is for society and cultivated talk
he should know no one intimately least of all a woman it was a new light on cecils character
have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired i can scarcely discuss no but have you ever
he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to thingsbooks picturesbut kill when they come to people
thats why ill speak out through all this muddle even now
its shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person
i would never have let myself go
but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters
then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour
that is the man all overplaying tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find
next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no
cecil all over again
he darent let a woman decide
hes the type whos kept europe back for a thousand years
every moment of his life hes forming you telling you whats charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own
so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon
thereforenot therefore i kissed you because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more selfcontrol
im not ashamed
i dont apologize
but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you
or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly
but thereforetherefore i settled to fight him lucy thought of a very good remark
you say mr vyse wants me to listen to him mr emerson
pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit and he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality
he said yes i have and sank down as if suddenly weary
im the same kind of brute at bottom
this desire to govern a womanit lies very deep and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden
but i do love you surely in a better way than he does he thought
yesreally in a better way
i want you to have your own thoughts even when i hold you in my arms he stretched them towards her
lucy be quicktheres no time for us to talk nowcome to me as you came in the spring and afterwards i will be gentle and explain
i have cared for you since that man died
i cannot live without you no good i thought she is marrying someone else but i meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun
as you came through the wood i saw that nothing else mattered
i called
i wanted to live and have my chance of joy and mr vyse said lucy who kept commendably calm
does he not matter
that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly
a detail of no importance i suppose but he stretched his arms over the table towards her
may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition he said it is our last chance
i shall do all that i can and as if he had done all else he turned to miss bartlett who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening
you wouldnt stop us this second time if you understood he said
i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards as though demolishing some invisible obstacle
she did not answer
it is being young he said quietly picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go
it is being certain that lucy cares for me really
it is that love and youth matter intellectually in silence the two women watched him
his last remark they knew was nonsense but was he going after it or not
would not he the cad the charlatan attempt a more dramatic finish
no
he was apparently content
he left them carefully closing the front door and when they looked through the hall window they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house
their tongues were loosed and they burst into stealthy rejoicings
oh luciacome back hereoh what an awful man lucy had no reactionat least not yet
well he amuses me she said
either im mad or else he is and im inclined to think its the latter
one more fuss through with you charlotte
many thanks
i think though that this is the last
my admirer will hardly trouble me again and miss bartlett too essayed the roguish well it isnt everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it
oh one oughtnt to laugh really
it might have been very serious
but you were so sensible and braveso unlike the girls of my day lets go down to them but once in the open air she paused
some emotionpity terror love but the emotion was strongseized her and she was aware of autumn
summer was ending and the evening brought her odours of decay the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring
that something or other mattered intellectually
a leaf violently agitated danced past her while other leaves lay motionless
that the earth was hastening to reenter darkness and the shadows of those trees over windy corner
hullo lucy
theres still light enough for another set if you twoll hurry mr
emerson has had to go what a nuisance
that spoils the four
i say cecil do play do theres a good chap
its floyds last day
do play tennis with us just this once cecils voice came my dear freddy i am no athlete
as you well remarked this very morning there are some chaps who are no good for anything but books i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you the scales fell from lucys eyes
how had she stood cecil for a moment
he was absolutely intolerable and the same evening she broke off her engagement
chapter xvii lying to cecil he was bewildered
he had nothing to say
he was not even angry but stood with a glass of whiskey between his hands trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion
she had chosen the moment before bed when in accordance with their bourgeois habit she always dispensed drinks to the men
freddy and mr floyd were sure to retire with their glasses while cecil invariably lingered sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard
i am very sorry about it she said i have carefully thought things over
we are too different
i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl it was a suitable speech but she was more angry than sorry and her voice showed it
differenthowhow i havent had a really good education for one thing she continued still on her knees by the sideboard
my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there
i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should i dont understand you
you arent like yourself
youre tired lucy tired she retorted kindling at once
that is exactly like you
you always think women dont mean what they say well you sound tired as if something has worried you what if i do
it doesnt prevent me from realizing the truth
i cant marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day you had that bad headache yesterdayall rightfor she had exclaimed indignantly i see its much more than headaches
but give me a moments time he closed his eyes
you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces
part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other parti find it difficulti am likely to say the wrong thing it struck her that he was not behaving so badly and her irritation increased
she again desired a struggle not a discussion
to bring on the crisis she said there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them
things must come to a breakingpoint some time and it happens to be today
if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to youwhen you wouldnt play tennis with freddy i never do play tennis said cecil painfully bewildered i never could play
i dont understand a word you say you can play well enough to make up a four
i thought it abominably selfish of you no i cantwell never mind the tennis
why couldnt youcouldnt you have warned me if you felt anything wrong
you talked of our wedding at lunchat least you let me talk i knew you wouldnt understand said lucy quite crossly
i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations
of course it isnt the tennisthat was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks
surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain she developed this position
often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wifefor instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband
i dont think so
you dont like freddy nor my mother
there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it untilwell until all things came to a point
they have today
i see clearly
i must speak
thats all i cannot think you were right said cecil gently
i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly
its all too horrible whats the good of a scene no good
but surely i have a right to hear a little more he put down his glass and opened the window
from where she knelt jangling her keys she could see a slit of darkness and peering into it as if it would tell him that little more his long thoughtful face
dont open the window and youd better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside he obeyed
i really think we had better go to bed if you dont mind
i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards
as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking but to cecil now that he was about to lose her she seemed each moment more desirable
he looked at her instead of through her for the first time since they were engaged
from a leonardo she had become a living woman with mysteries and forces of her own with qualities that even eluded art
his brain recovered from the shock and in a burst of genuine devotion he cried but i love you and i did think you loved me i did not she said
i thought i did at first
i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too he began to walk up and down the room and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour
she had counted on his being petty
it would have made things easier for her
by a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition
you dont love me evidently
i dare say you are right not to
but it would hurt a little less if i knew why becausea phrase came to her and she accepted ityoure the sort who cant know any one intimately a horrified look came into his eyes
i dont mean exactly that
but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something
it is that more or less
when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now youre always protecting me her voice swelled
i wont be protected
i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right
to shield me is an insult
cant i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it secondhand through you
a womans place
you despise my motheri know you dobecause shes conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodnessshe rose to her feetconventional cecil youre that for you may understand beautiful things but you dont know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me
i wont be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me
thats why i break off my engagement
you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people she stopped
there was a pause
then cecil said with great emotion it is true true on the whole she corrected full of some vague shame
true every word
it is a revelation
it isi anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife he repeated the sort that can know no one intimately it is true
i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged
i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother
you are even greater than i thought she withdrew a step
im not going to worry you
you are far too good to me
i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldnt marry me and so have given me a chance to improve
i have never known you till this evening
i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be
but this evening you are a different person new thoughtseven a new voice what do you mean by a new voice she asked seized with incontrollable anger
i mean that a new person seems speaking through you said he
then she lost her balance
she cried if you think i am in love with some one else you are very much mistaken of course i dont think that
you are not that kind lucy oh yes you do think it
its your old idea the idea that has kept europe backi mean the idea that women are always thinking of men
if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says oh she had someone else in her mind she hopes to get someone else its disgusting brutal
as if a girl cant break it off for the sake of freedom he answered reverently i may have said that in the past
i shall never say it again
you have taught me better she began to redden and pretended to examine the windows again
of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity
i beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was
i only meant that there was a force in you that i hadnt known of up till now all right cecil that will do
dont apologize to me
it was my mistake it is a question between ideals yours and minepure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler
i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new his voice broke
i must actually thank you for what you have donefor showing me what i really am
solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman
will you shake hands of course i will said lucy twisting up her other hand in the curtains
goodnight cecil
goodbye
thats all right
im sorry about it
thank you very much for your gentleness let me light your candle shall i they went into the hall
thank you
goodnight again
god bless you lucy goodbye cecil she watched him steal upstairs while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings
on the landing he paused strong in his renunciation and gave her a look of memorable beauty
for all his culture cecil was an ascetic at heart and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it
she could never marry
in the tumult of her soul that stood firm
cecil believed in her she must some day believe in herself
she must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently who care for liberty and not for men she must forget that george loved her that george had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release that george had gone away intowhat was itthe darkness
she put out the lamp
it did not do to think nor for the matter of that to feel
she gave up trying to understand herself and joined the vast armies of the benighted who follow neither the heart nor the brain and march to their destiny by catchwords
the armies are full of pleasant and pious folk
but they have yielded to the only enemy that mattersthe enemy within
they have sinned against passion and truth and vain will be their strife after virtue
as the years pass they are censured
their pleasantry and their piety show cracks their wit becomes cynicism their unselfishness hypocrisy they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go
they have sinned against eros and against pallas athene and not by any heavenly intervention but by the ordinary course of nature those allied deities will be avenged
lucy entered this army when she pretended to george that she did not love him and pretended to cecil that she loved no one
the night received her as it had received miss bartlett thirty years before
chapter xviii lying to mr beebe mrs honeychurch freddy and the servants windy corner lay not on the summit of the ridge but a few hundred feet down the southern slope at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill
on either side of it was a shallow ravine filled with ferns and pinetrees and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the weald
whenever mr beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth and poised in the middle of them windy cornerhe laughed
the situation was so glorious the house so commonplace not to say impertinent
the late mr honeychurch had affected the cube because it gave him the most accommodation for his money and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret shaped like a rhinoceros horn where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road
so impertinentand yet the house did for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly
other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously yet all these suggested the accidental the temporary while windy corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of natures own creation
one might laugh at the house but one never shuddered
mr beebe was bicycling over this monday afternoon with a piece of gossip
he had heard from the miss alans
these admirable ladies since they could not go to cissie villa had changed their plans
they were going to greece instead
since florence did my poor sister so much good wrote miss catharine we do not see why we should not try athens this winter
of course athens is a plunge and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread but after all we can take that with us and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train
but is there an english church and the letter went on to say i do not expect we shall go any further than athens but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at constantinople we should be so grateful lucy would enjoy this letter and the smile with which mr beebe greeted windy corner was partly for her
she would see the fun of it and some of its beauty for she must see some beauty
though she was hopeless about pictures and though she dressed so unevenlyoh that cerise frock yesterday at churchshe must see some beauty in life or she could not play the piano as she did
he had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends that their psychology is a modern development and has not yet been understood
this theory had he known it had possibly just been illustrated by facts
ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea to see his niece and to observe whether miss honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit athens
a carriage was drawn up outside windy corner and just as he caught sight of the house it started bowled up the drive and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road
therefore it must be the horse who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him
the door opened obediently and two men emerged whom mr beebe recognized as cecil and freddy
they were an odd couple to go driving but he saw a trunk beside the coachmans legs
cecil who wore a bowler must be going away while freddy a capwas seeing him to the station
they walked rapidly taking the short cuts and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road
they shook hands with the clergyman but did not speak
so youre off for a minute mr vyse he asked
cecil said yes while freddy edged away
i was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of miss honeychurch he quoted from it
isnt it wonderful
isnt it romance
most certainly they will go to constantinople
they are taken in a snare that cannot fail
they will end by going round the world cecil listened civilly and said he was sure that lucy would be amused and interested
isnt romance capricious
i never notice it in you young people you do nothing but play lawn tennis and say that romance is dead while the miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing
a really comfortable pension at constantinople so they call it out of decency but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn
no ordinary view will content the miss alans
they want the pension keats im awfully sorry to interrupt mr beebe said freddy but have you any matches i have said cecil and it did not escape mr beebes notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly
you have never met these miss alans have you mr vyse never then you dont see the wonder of this greek visit
i havent been to greece myself and dont mean to go and i cant imagine any of my friends going
it is altogether too big for our little lot
dont you think so
italy is just about as much as we can manage
italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilishi am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus
all right freddyi am not being clever upon my word i am noti took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when youve done with them he lit a cigarette and went on talking to the two young men
i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian
big enough in all conscience
the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me
there the contrast is just as much as i can realize
but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria youre quite right said cecil
greece is not for our little lot and he got in
freddy followed nodding to the clergyman whom he trusted not to be pulling ones leg really
and before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out and came running back for vyses matchbox which had not been returned
as he took it he said im so glad you only talked about books
cecils hard hit
lucy wont marry him
if youd gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down but when late last night
i must go perhaps they wont want me down there nogo on
goodbye thank goodness exclaimed mr beebe to himself and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly it was the one foolish thing she ever did
oh what a glorious riddance and after a little thought he negotiated the slope into windy corner light of heart
the house was again as it ought to becut off forever from cecils pretentious world
he would find miss minnie down in the garden
in the drawingroom lucy was tinkling at a mozart sonata
he hesitated a moment but went down the garden as requested
there he found a mournful company
it was a blustering day and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias
mrs honeychurch who looked cross was tying them up while miss bartlett unsuitably dressed impeded her with offers of assistance
at a little distance stood minnie and the gardenchild a minute importation each holding either end of a long piece of bass
oh how do you do mr beebe
gracious what a mess everything is
look at my scarlet pompoms and the wind blowing your skirts about and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in and then the carriage having to go out when i had counted on having powell whogive everyone their duedoes tie up dahlias properly evidently mrs honeychurch was shattered
how do you do said miss bartlett with a meaning glance as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales
here lennie the bass cried mrs honeychurch
the gardenchild who did not know what bass was stood rooted to the path with horror
minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable today and that it was not her fault if dahliastrings would tear longways instead of across
come for a walk with me he told her
you have worried them as much as they can stand
mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly
i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may oh must you
yes donot the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full alreadyim perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it mr beebe who was an adept at relieving situations invited miss bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity
yes charlotte i dont want youdo go theres nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it miss bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed but when she had exasperated everyone except minnie by a refusal she turned round and exasperated minnie by an acceptance
as they walked up the garden the orange cactus fell and mr beebes last vision was of the gardenchild clasping it like a lover his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom
it is terrible this havoc among the flowers he remarked
it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment enunciated miss bartlett
perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother
or will she come with us i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits theyre angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast whispered minnie and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy wont play with me
in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday dont be a prig said her uncle arthur
go and put on your boots he stepped into the drawingroom where lucy was still attentively pursuing the sonatas of mozart
she stopped when he entered
how do you do
miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at the beehive
would you come too i dont think i will thank you no i didnt suppose you would care to much lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords
how delicate those sonatas are said mr beebe though at the bottom of his heart he thought them silly little things
lucy passed into schumann
miss honeychurch yes i met them on the hill
your brother told me oh he did she sounded annoyed
mr beebe felt hurt for he had thought that she would like him to be told
i neednt say that it will go no further mother charlotte cecil freddy you said lucy playing a note for each person who knew and then playing a sixth note
if youll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing so i hoped other people would think but they dont seem to i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise so does mother
mother minds dreadfully i am very sorry for that said mr beebe with feeling
mrs honeychurch who hated all changes did mind but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended and only for the minute
it was really a ruse of lucys to justify her despondencya ruse of which she was not herself conscious for she was marching in the armies of darkness
and freddy minds still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he
i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you boys are so odd minnie could be heard arguing with miss bartlett through the floor
tea at the beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel
mr beebe saw that lucyvery properlydid not wish to discuss her action so after a sincere expression of sympathy he said i have had an absurd letter from miss alan
that was really what brought me over
i thought it might amuse you all how delightful said lucy in a dull voice
for the sake of something to do he began to read her the letter
after a few words her eyes grew alert and soon she interrupted him with going abroad
when do they start next week i gather did freddy say whether he was driving straight back no he didnt because i do hope he wont go gossiping so she did want to talk about her broken engagement
always complaisant he put the letter away
but she at once exclaimed in a high voice oh do tell me more about the miss alans
how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast she laughed heartily
oh delightful
i wish theyd take me has italy filled you with the fever of travel
perhaps george emerson is right
he says that italy is only an euphuism for fate oh not italy but constantinople
i have always longed to go to constantinople
constantinople is practically asia isnt it mr beebe reminded her that constantinople was still unlikely and that the miss alans only aimed at athens with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe but this made no difference to her enthusiasm
she had always longed to go to greece even more it seemed
he saw to his surprise that she was apparently serious
i didnt realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa oh thats nothing i assure you cissie villas nothing to me i would give anything to go with them would your mother spare you again so soon
you have scarcely been home three months she must spare me cried lucy in growing excitement
i simply must go away
i have to she ran her fingers hysterically through her hair
dont you see that i have to go away
i didnt realize at the timeand of course i want to see constantinople so particularly you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel yes yes
i knew youd understand mr beebe did not quite understand
why could not miss honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family
cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line and was not going to annoy her
then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying
he hinted this to her and she accepted the hint eagerly
yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down i am afraid it has been a bothersome business he said gently
no not at all
cecil was very kind indeed onlyi had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a littleit was that he is so masterful
i found that he wouldnt let me go my own way
he would improve me in places where i cant be improved
cecil wont let a woman decide for herselfin fact he darent
what nonsense i do talk
but that is the kind of thing it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you
i do sympathize and agree most profoundly
i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece but i must go somewhere she cried
i have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing she struck her knees with clenched fists and repeated i must
and the time i shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring
you all think much too highly of me
i wish you werent so kind at this moment miss bartlett entered and her nervousness increased
i must get away ever so far
i must know my own mind and where i want to go come along tea tea tea said mr beebe and bustled his guests out of the frontdoor
he hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat
when he returned for it he heard to his relief and surprise the tinkling of a mozart sonata
she is playing again he said to miss bartlett
lucy can always play was the acid reply
one is very thankful that she has such a resource
she is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be
i know all about it
the marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak miss bartlett gave a kind of wriggle and he prepared for a discussion
he had never fathomed miss bartlett
as he had put it to himself at florence she might yet reveal depths of strangeness if not of meaning but she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable
he assumed that much and he had no hesitation in discussing lucy with her
minnie was fortunately collecting ferns
she opened the discussion with we had much better let the matter drop i wonder it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street
it would be death to gossip about mr vyses dismissal at the present moment mr beebe raised his eyebrows
death is a strong wordsurely too strong
there was no question of tragedy
he said of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses
freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind i know said miss bartlett civilly
yet freddy ought not to have told even you
one cannot be too careful quite so i do implore absolute secrecy
a chance word to a chattering friend and exactly he was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words
a rector lives in a web of petty secrets and confidences and warnings and the wiser he is the less he will regard them
he will change the subject as did mr beebe saying cheerfully have you heard from any bertolini people lately
i believe you keep up with miss lavish
it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one anothers lives
two three four six of usno eight i had forgotten the emersonshave kept more or less in touch
we must really give the signora a testimonial and miss bartlett not favouring the scheme they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern
on the summit they paused
the sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in surrey
grey clouds were charging across tissues of white which stretched and shredded and tore slowly until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue
summer was retreating
the wind roared the trees groaned yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven
the weather was breaking up breaking broken and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery
mr beebes eyes rested on windy corner where lucy sat practising mozart
no smile came to his lips and changing the subject again he said we shant have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on
the darkness last night was appalling they reached the beehive tavern at about five oclock
that amiable hostelry possesses a verandah in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room and have tea at a table comfortably
mr beebe saw that miss bartlett would be cold if she sat out and that minnie would be dull if she sat in so he proposed a division of forces
they would hand the child her food through the window
thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of lucy
i have been thinking miss bartlett he said and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion she bowed
nothing about the past
i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousins credit
she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her
but the future
seriously what do you think of this greek plan he pulled out the letter again
i dont know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career
its alli cant explainits wrong miss bartlett read the letter in silence laid it down seemed to hesitate and then read it again
i cant see the point of it myself to his astonishment she replied there i cannot agree with you
in it i spy lucys salvation really
now why she wanted to leave windy corner i knowbut it seems so odd so unlike her soi was going to sayselfish it is natural surelyafter such painful scenesthat she should desire a change here apparently was one of those points that the male intellect misses
mr beebe exclaimed so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced
perhaps she must have a change
i have no sisters orand i dont understand these things
but why need she go as far as greece you may well ask that replied miss bartlett who was evidently interested and had almost dropped her evasive manner
why greece
what is it minnie dearjam
why not tunbridge wells
oh mr beebe
i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this morning
i cannot help her
i will say no more
perhaps i have already said too much
i am not to talk
i wanted her to spend six months with me at tunbridge wells and she refused mr beebe poked at a crumb with his knife
but my feelings are of no importance
i know too well that i get on lucys nerves
our tour was a failure
she wanted to leave florence and when we got to rome she did not want to be in rome and all the time i felt that i was spending her mothers money let us keep to the future though interrupted mr beebe
i want your advice very well said charlotte with a choky abruptness that was new to him though familiar to lucy
i for one will help her to go to greece
will you mr beebe considered
it is absolutely necessary she continued lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion an intensity that surprised him
i knowi know the darkness was coming on and he felt that this odd woman really did know
she must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes
i trust that the servants know nothing
afterwardsbut i may have said too much already
only lucy and i are helpless against mrs honeychurch alone
if you help we may succeed
otherwise otherwise otherwise she repeated as if the word held finality
yes i will help her said the clergyman setting his jaw firm
come let us go back now and settle the whole thing up miss bartlett burst into florid gratitude
the tavern signa beehive trimmed evenly with beescreaked in the wind outside as she thanked him
mr beebe did not quite understand the situation but then he did not desire to understand it nor to jump to the conclusion of another man that would have attracted a grosser mind
he only felt that miss bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form
its very vagueness spurred him into knighterrantry
his belief in celibacy so reticent so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower
they that marry do well but they that refrain do better so ran his belief and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure
in the case of lucy the feeling was intensified through dislike of cecil and he was willing to go furtherto place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity
the feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement
yet it existed and it alone explains his action subsequently and his influence on the action of others
the compact that he made with miss bartlett in the tavern was to help not only lucy but religion also
they hurried home through a world of black and grey
he conversed on indifferent topics the emersons need of a housekeeper servants italian servants novels about italy novels with a purpose could literature influence life
windy corner glimmered
in the garden mrs honeychurch now helped by freddy still wrestled with the lives of her flowers
it gets too dark she said hopelessly
this comes of putting off
we might have known the weather would break up soon and now lucy wants to go to greece
i dont know what the worlds coming to mrs
honeychurch he said go to greece she must
come up to the house and lets talk it over
do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse mr
beebe im thankfulsimply thankful so am i said freddy
good
now come up to the house they conferred in the diningroom for half an hour
lucy would never have carried the greek scheme alone
it was expensive and dramaticboth qualities that her mother loathed
nor would charlotte have succeeded
the honours of the day rested with mr beebe
by his tact and common sense and by his influence as a clergymanfor a clergyman who was not a fool influenced mrs honeychurch greatlyhe bent her to their purpose i dont see why greece is necessary she said but as you do i suppose it is all right
it must be something i cant understand
lucy
lets tell her
lucy she is playing the piano mr beebe said
he opened the door and heard the words of a song look not thou on beautys charming i didnt know that miss honeychurch sang too sit thou still when kings are arming taste not when the winecup glistens its a song that cecil gave her
how odd girls are whats that called lucy stopping short
all right dear said mrs honeychurch kindly
she went into the drawingroom and mr beebe heard her kiss lucy and say i am sorry i was so cross about greece but it came on the top of the dahlias rather a hard voice said thank you mother that doesnt matter a bit and you are right toogreece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you oh splendid
oh thank you mr beebe followed
lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys
she was glad but he had expected greater gladness
her mother bent over her
freddy to whom she had been singing reclined on the floor with his head against her and an unlit pipe between his lips
oddly enough the group was beautiful
mr beebe who loved the art of the past was reminded of a favourite theme the santa conversazione in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble thingsa theme neither sensual nor sensational and therefore ignored by the art of today
why should lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home
taste not when the winecup glistens speak not when the people listens she continued
heres mr beebe mr
beebe knows my rude ways its a beautiful song and a wise one said he
go on it isnt very good she said listlessly
i forget whyharmony or something i suspected it was unscholarly
its so beautiful the tunes right enough said freddy but the words are rotten
why throw up the sponge how stupidly you talk said his sister
the santa conversazione was broken up
after all there was no reason that lucy should talk about greece or thank him for persuading her mother so he said goodbye
freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch and with his usual felicity of phrase said this has been a day and a half stop thine ear against the singer wait a minute she is finishing from the red gold keep thy finger vacant heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet die i love weather like this said freddy
mr beebe passed into it
the two main facts were clear
she had behaved splendidly and he had helped her
he could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girls life
if here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled he must acquiesce she was choosing the better part
vacant heart and hand and eye perhaps the song stated the better part rather too strongly
he half fancied that the soaring accompanimentwhich he did not lose in the shout of the galereally agreed with freddy and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned vacant heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet die however for the fourth time windy corner lay poised below himnow as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness
chapter xix lying to mr emerson the miss alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near bloomsburya clean airless establishment much patronized by provincial england
they always perched there before crossing the great seas and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes guidebooks mackintosh squares digestive bread and other continental necessaries
that there are shops abroad even in athens never occurred to them for they regarded travel as a species of warfare only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the haymarket stores
miss honeychurch they trusted would take care to equip herself duly
quinine could now be obtained in tabloids paper soap was a great help towards freshening up ones face in the train
lucy promised a little depressed
but of course you know all about these things and you have mr vyse to help you
a gentleman is such a standby mrs honeychurch who had come up to town with her daughter began to drum nervously upon her cardcase
we think it so good of mr vyse to spare you miss catharine continued
it is not every young man who would be so unselfish
but perhaps he will come out and join you later on or does his work keep him in london said miss teresa the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters
however we shall see him when he sees you off
i do so long to see him no one will see lucy off interposed mrs honeychurch
she doesnt like it no i hate seeingsoff said lucy
really
how funny
i should have thought that in this case oh mrs honeychurch you arent going
it is such a pleasure to have met you they escaped and lucy said with relief thats all right
we just got through that time but her mother was annoyed
i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic
but i cannot see why you didnt tell your friends about cecil and be done with it
there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant lucy had plenty to say in reply
she described the miss alans character they were such gossips and if one told them the news would be everywhere in no time
but why shouldnt it be everywhere in no time because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england
i shall tell them then
its much pleasanter
how wet it is
lets turn in here here was the british museum
mrs honeychurch refused
if they must take shelter let it be in a shop
lucy felt contemptuous for she was on the tack of caring for greek sculpture and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from mr beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods
oh well let it be shop then
lets go to mudies
ill buy a guidebook you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me im so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this holeandcorner work
youve got rid of cecilwell and good and im thankful hes gone though i did feel angry for the minute
but why not announce it
why this hushing up and tiptoeing its only for a few days but why at all lucy was silent
she was drifting away from her mother
it was quite easy to say because george emerson has been bothering me and if he hears ive given up cecil may begin againquite easy and it had the incidental advantage of being true
but she could not say it
she disliked confidences for they might lead to selfknowledge and to that king of terrorslight
ever since that last evening at florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul
mrs honeychurch too was silent
she was thinking my daughter wont answer me she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with freddy and me
any rag tag and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home and as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long she burst out with youre tired of windy corner this was perfectly true
lucy had hoped to return to windy corner when she escaped from cecil but she discovered that her home existed no longer
it might exist for freddy who still lived and thought straight but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain
she did not acknowledge that her brain was warped for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment and she was disordering the very instruments of life
she only felt i do not love george i broke off my engagement because i did not love george i must go to greece because i do not love george it is more important that i should look up gods in the dictionary than that i should help my mother everyone else is behaving very badly she only felt irritable and petulant and anxious to do what she was not expected to do and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation
oh mother what rubbish you talk
of course im not tired of windy corner then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour she laughed faintly half a minute would be nearer perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether hush mother
people will hear you for they had entered mudies
she bought baedeker and then continued of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been
you see i come into my money next year tears came into her mothers eyes
driven by nameless bewilderment by what is in older people termed eccentricity lucy determined to make this point clear
ive seen the world so littlei felt so out of things in italy
i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london morenot a cheap ticket like today but to stop
i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl and mess with typewriters and latchkeys exploded mrs honeychurch
and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police
and call it a missionwhen no one wants you
and call it dutywhen it means that you cant stand your own home
and call it workwhen thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is
and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them i want more independence said lucy lamely she knew that she wanted something and independence is a useful cry we can always say that we have not got it
she tried to remember her emotions in florence those had been sincere and passionate and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latchkeys
but independence was certainly her cue
very well
take your independence and be gone
rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food
despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear viewand then share a flat with another girl lucy screwed up her mouth and said perhaps i spoke hastily oh goodness her mother flashed
how you do remind me of charlotte bartlett charlotte flashed lucy in her turn pierced at last by a vivid pain
more every moment i dont know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike well i see the likeness
the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words
you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters what rubbish
and if you dislike charlotte so its rather a pity you asked her to stop
i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to there you go i beg your pardon charlotte again my dear thats all her very words lucy clenched her teeth
my point is that you oughtnt to have asked charlotte to stop
i wish you would keep to the point and the conversation died off into a wrangle
she and her mother shopped in silence spoke little in the train little again in the carriage which met them at dorking station
it had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep surrey lanes showers of water fell from the overhanging beechtrees and rattled on the hood
lucy complained that the hood was stuffy
leaning forward she looked out into the steaming dusk and watched the carriagelamp pass like a searchlight over mud and leaves and reveal nothing beautiful
the crush when charlotte gets in will be abominable she remarked
for they were to pick up miss bartlett at summer street where she had been dropped as the carriage went down to pay a call on mr beebes old mother
we shall have to sit three a side because the trees drop and yet it isnt raining
oh for a little air then she listened to the horses hoofshe has not toldhe has not told that melody was blurred by the soft road
cant we have the hood down she demanded and her mother with sudden tenderness said very well old lady stop the horse and the horse was stopped and lucy and powell wrestled with the hood and squirted water down mrs honeychurchs neck
but now that the hood was down she did see something that she would have missedthere were no lights in the windows of cissie villa and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock
is that house to let again powell she called
yes miss he replied
have they gone it is too far out of town for the young gentleman and his fathers rheumatism has come on so he cant stop on alone so they are trying to let furnished was the answer
they have gone then yes miss they have gone lucy sank back
the carriage stopped at the rectory
she got out to call for miss bartlett
so the emersons had gone and all this bother about greece had been unnecessary
waste
that word seemed to sum up the whole of life
wasted plans wasted money wasted love and she had wounded her mother
was it possible that she had muddled things away
quite possible
other people had
when the maid opened the door she was unable to speak and stared stupidly into the hall
miss bartlett at once came forward and after a long preamble asked a great favour might she go to church
mr beebe and his mother had already gone but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostesss full sanction for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more
certainly said the hostess wearily
i forgot it was friday
lets all go
powell can go round to the stables lucy dearest no church for me thank you a sigh and they departed
the church was invisible but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour
this was a stained window through which some feeble light was shining and when the door opened lucy heard mr beebes voice running through the litany to a minute congregation
even their church built upon the slope of the hill so artfully with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingleeven their church had lost its charm and the thing one never talked aboutreligionwas fading like all the other things
she followed the maid into the rectory
would she object to sitting in mr beebes study
there was only that one fire
she would not object
some one was there already for lucy heard the words a lady to wait sir old mr emerson was sitting by the fire with his foot upon a goutstool
oh miss honeychurch that you should come he quavered and lucy saw an alteration in him since last sunday
not a word would come to her lips
george she had faced and could have faced again but she had forgotten how to treat his father
miss honeychurch dear we are so sorry
george is so sorry
he thought he had a right to try
i cannot blame my boy and yet i wish he had told me first
he ought not to have tried
i knew nothing about it at all if only she could remember how to behave
he held up his hand
but you must not scold him lucy turned her back and began to look at mr beebes books
i taught him he quavered to trust in love
i said when love comes that is reality i said passion does not blind
no
passion is sanity and the woman you love she is the only person you will ever really understand he sighed true everlastingly true though my day is over and though there is the result
poor boy
he is so sorry
he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in that whatever you felt you did not mean
yethis voice gathered strength he spoke out to make certainmiss honeychurch do you remember italy lucy selected a booka volume of old testament commentaries
holding it up to her eyes she said i have no wish to discuss italy or any subject connected with your son but you do remember it he has misbehaved himself from the first i only was told that he loved you last sunday
i never could judge behaviour
iisuppose he has feeling a little steadier she put the book back and turned round to him
his face was drooping and swollen but his eyes though they were sunken deep gleamed with a childs courage
why he has behaved abominably she said
i am glad he is sorry
do you know what he did not abominably was the gentle correction
he only tried when he should not have tried
you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love
do not go out of georges life saying he is abominable no of course said lucy ashamed at the reference to cecil
abominable is much too strong
i am sorry i used it about your son
i think i will go to church after all
my mother and my cousin have gone
i shall not be so very late especially as he has gone under he said quietly
what was that gone under naturally he beat his palms together in silence his head fell on his chest
i dont understand as his mother did but mr emersonmr
emersonwhat are you talking about when i wouldnt have george baptized said he
lucy was frightened
and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round
she thought it a judgement he shuddered
oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents
oh horribleworst of allworse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again
a judgement
and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church
is it possible miss honeychurch
shall we slip back into the darkness for ever i dont know gasped lucy
i dont understand this sort of thing
i was not meant to understand it but mr eagerhe came when i was out and acted according to his principles
i dont blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill
he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it it was thus that mr emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of god
oh how terrible said lucy forgetting her own affairs at last
he was not baptized said the old man
i did hold firm and he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books as ifat what costhe had won a victory over them
my boy shall go back to the earth untouched she asked whether young mr emerson was ill ohlast sunday he started into the present
george last sundayno not ill just gone under
he is never ill
but he is his mothers son
her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live
it was always touch and go
he will live but he will not think it worth while to live
he will never think anything worth while
you remember that church at florence lucy did remember and how she had suggested that george should collect postage stamps
after you left florencehorrible
then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better
you saw him bathing i am so sorry but it is no good discussing this affair
i am deeply sorry about it then there came something about a novel
i didnt follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old
ah well one must have failures
george comes down tomorrow and takes me up to his london rooms
he cant bear to be about here and i must be where he is mr
emerson cried the girl dont leave at least not on my account
i am going to greece
dont leave your comfortable house it was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled
how good everyone is
and look at mr beebe housing mecame over this morning and heard i was going
here i am so comfortable with a fire yes but you wont go back to london
its absurd i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he cant
he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about youi am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened oh mr emersonshe took hold of his handyou mustnt
ive been bother enough to the world by now
i cant have you moving out of your house when you like it and perhaps losing money through itall on my account
you must stop
i am just going to greece all the way to greece her manner altered
to greece so you must stop
you wont talk about this business i know
i can trust you both certainly you can
we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen i shouldnt want i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george
no it was wrong of george to try
we have pushed our beliefs too far
i fancy that we deserve sorrow she looked at the books againblack brown and that acrid theological blue
they surrounded the visitors on every side they were piled on the tables they pressed against the very ceiling
to lucy who could not see that mr emerson was profoundly religious and differed from mr beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passionit seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum when he was unhappy and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman
more certain than ever that she was tired he offered her his chair
no please sit still
i think i will sit in the carriage miss honeychurch you do sound tired not a bit said lucy with trembling lips
but you are and theres a look of george about you
and what were you saying about going abroad she was silent
greeceand she saw that he was thinking the word overgreece but you were to be married this year i thought not till january it wasnt said lucy clasping her hands
would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point
i suppose that mr vyse is going with you
i hopeit isnt because george spoke that you are both going no i hope that you will enjoy greece with mr vyse thank you at that moment mr beebe came back from church
his cassock was covered with rain
thats all right he said kindly
i counted on you two keeping each other company
its pouring again
the entire congregation which consists of your cousin your mother and my mother stands waiting in the church till the carriage fetches it
did powell go round i think so ill see noof course ill see
how are the miss alans very well thank you did you tell mr emerson about greece ii did dont you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans
now miss honeychurch go backkeep warm
i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling and he hurried off to the stables
he is not going she said hoarsely
i made a slip
mr vyse does stop behind in england somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man
to george to cecil she would have lied again but he seemed so near the end of things so dignified in his approach to the gulf of which he gave one account and the books that surrounded him another so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed that the true chivalrynot the wornout chivalry of sex but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the oldawoke in her and at whatever risk she told him that cecil was not her companion to greece
and she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty and he lifting his eyes said you are leaving him
you are leaving the man you love ii had to why miss honeychurch why terror came over her and she lied again
she made the long convincing speech that she had made to mr beebe and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more
he heard her in silence and then said my dear i am worried about you
it seems to medreamily she was not alarmedthat you are in a muddle she shook her head
take an old mans word theres nothing worse than a muddle in all the world
it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful
it is on my muddles that i look back with horroron the things that i might have avoided
we can help one another but little
i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle
do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and werent
do you remember before when you refused the room with the view
those were muddleslittle but ominousand i am fearing that you are in one now she was silent
dont trust me miss honeychurch
though life is very glorious it is difficult she was still silent
life wrote a friend of mine is a public performance on the violin in which you must learn the instrument as you go along i think he puts it well
man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes alongespecially the function of love then he burst out excitedly thats it thats what i mean
you love george and after his long preamble the three words burst against lucy like waves from the open sea
but you do he went on not waiting for contradiction
you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it
you wont marry the other man for his sake how dare you gasped lucy with the roaring of waters in her ears
oh how like a mani mean to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man but you are she summoned physical disgust
youre shocked but i mean to shock you
its the only hope at times
i can reach you no other way
you must marry or your life will be wasted
you have gone too far to retreat
i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry
i know that with george you will find them and that you love him
then be his wife
he is already part of you
though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die
it isnt possible to love and to part
you will wish that it was
you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you
i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal lucy began to cry with anger and though her anger passed away soon her tears remained
i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body
ah
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that
ah
for a little directness to liberate the soul
your soul dear lucy
i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round
but we have souls
i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours
i cannot bear it
it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell then he checked himself
what nonsense i have talkedhow abstract and remote
and i have made you cry
dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy
when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by lovemarry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made she could not understand him the words were indeed remote
yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn veil after veil and she saw to the bottom of her soul
then lucy youve frightened me she moaned
cecilmr
beebethe tickets boughteverything she fell sobbing into the chair
im caught in the tangle
i must suffer and grow old away from him
i cannot break the whole of life for his sake
they trusted me a carriage drew up at the frontdoor
give george my loveonce only
tell him muddle then she arranged her veil while the tears poured over her cheeks inside
lucy nothey are in the halloh please not mr emersonthey trust me but why should they when you have deceived them mr beebe opened the door saying heres my mother youre not worthy of their trust whats that said mr beebe sharply
i was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you one minute mother he came in and shut the door
i dont follow you mr emerson
to whom do you refer
trust whom i mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george
they have loved one another all along mr beebe looked at the sobbing girl
he was very quiet and his white face with its ruddy whiskers seemed suddenly inhuman
a long black column he stood and awaited her reply
i shall never marry him quavered lucy
a look of contempt came over him and he said why not mr
beebei have misled youi have misled myself oh rubbish miss honeychurch it is not rubbish said the old man hotly
its the part of people that you dont understand mr beebe laid his hand on the old mans shoulder pleasantly
lucy
lucy called voices from the carriage
mr
beebe could you help me he looked amazed at the request and said in a low stern voice i am more grieved than i can possibly express
it is lamentable lamentableincredible whats wrong with the boy fired up the other again
nothing mr emerson except that he no longer interests me
marry george miss honeychurch
he will do admirably he walked out and left them
they heard him guiding his mother upstairs
lucy the voices called
she turned to mr emerson in despair
but his face revived her
it was the face of a saint who understood
now it is all dark
now beauty and passion seem never to have existed
i know
but remember the mountains over florence and the view
ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave
you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise
george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him
am i justified into his own eyes tears came
yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth
truth counts truth does count you kiss me said the girl
you kiss me
i will try he gave her a sense of deities reconciled a feeling that in gaining the man she loved she would gain something for the whole world
throughout the squalor of her homeward driveshe spoke at oncehis salutation remained
he had robbed the body of its taint the worlds taunts of their sting he had shown her the holiness of direct desire
she never exactly understood she would say in after years how he managed to strengthen her
it was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once chapter xx the end of the middle ages the miss alans did go to greece but they went by themselves
they alone of this little company will double malea and plough the waters of the saronic gulf
they alone will visit athens and delphi and either shrine of intellectual songthat upon the acropolis encircled by blue seas that under parnassus where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity
trembling anxious cumbered with much digestive bread they did proceed to constantinople they did go round the world
the rest of us must be contented with a fair but a less arduous goal
italiam petimus we return to the pension bertolini
george said it was his old room
no it isnt said lucy because it is the room i had and i had your fathers room
i forget why charlotte made me for some reason he knelt on the tiled floor and laid his face in her lap
george you baby get up why shouldnt i be a baby murmured george
unable to answer this question she put down his sock which she was trying to mend and gazed out through the window
it was evening and again the spring
oh bother charlotte she said thoughtfully
what can such people be made of same stuff as parsons are made of nonsense quite right
it is nonsense now you get up off the cold floor or youll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly why shouldnt i laugh he asked pinning her with his elbows and advancing his face to hers
whats there to cry at
kiss me here he indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome
he was a boy after all
when it came to the point it was she who remembered the past she into whose soul the iron had entered she who knew whose room this had been last year
it endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong
any letters he asked
just a line from freddy now kiss me here then here then threatened again with rheumatism he strolled to the window opened it as the english will and leant out
there was the parapet there the river there to the left the beginnings of the hills
the cabdriver who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent might be that very phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago
a passion of gratitudeall feelings grow to passions in the southcame over the husband and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool
he had helped himself it is true but how stupidly
all the fighting that mattered had been done by othersby italy by his father by his wife
lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows san miniato
ill just finish your sock signorino domani faremo uno giro called the cabman with engaging certainty
george told him that he was mistaken they had no money to throw away on driving
and the people who had not meant to helpthe miss lavishes the cecils the miss bartletts
ever prone to magnify fate george counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment
anything good in freddys letter not yet his own content was absolute but hers held bitterness the honeychurches had not forgiven them they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy she had alienated windy corner perhaps for ever
what does he say silly boy
he thinks hes being dignified
he knew we should go off in the springhe has known it for six monthsthat if mother wouldnt give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands
they had fair warning and now he calls it an elopement
ridiculous boy signorino domani faremo uno giro but it will all come right in the end
he has to build us both up from the beginning again
i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women
he has for the second time quite altered
why will men have theories about women
i havent any about men
i wish too that mr beebe you may well wish that he will never forgive usi mean he will never be interested in us again
i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner
i wish he hadntbut if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run perhaps then he said more gently well i acted the truththe only thing i did doand you came back to me
so possibly you know he turned back into the room
nonsense with that sock he carried her to the window so that she too saw all the view
they sank upon their knees invisible from the road they hoped and began to whisper one anothers names
ah
it was worth while it was the great joy that they had expected and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt
they were silent
signorino domani faremo oh bother that man but lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said no dont be rude to him then with a catching of her breath she murmured mr
eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte
how cruel she would be to a man like that look at the lights going over the bridge but this room reminds me of charlotte
how horrible to grow old in charlottes way
to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldnt have heard your father was in the house
for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense
you couldnt have made me
when i am very happyshe kissed himi remember on how little it all hangs
if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever but she did know said george she did see my father surely
he said so oh no she didnt see him
she was upstairs with old mrs beebe dont you remember and then went straight to the church
she said so george was obstinate again
my father said he saw her and i prefer his word
he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett
a few minutes before you came in
she was turning to go as he woke up
he didnt speak to her then they spoke of other thingsthe desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another and whose reward is to rest quietly in each others arms
it was long ere they returned to miss bartlett but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting
george who disliked any darkness said its clear that she knew
then why did she risk the meeting
she knew he was there and yet she went to church they tried to piece the thing together
as they talked an incredible solution came into lucys mind
she rejected it and said how like charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment but something in the dying evening in the roar of the river in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life and george whispered or did she mean it mean what signorino domani faremo uno giro lucy bent forward and said with gentleness lascia prego lascia
siamo sposati scusi tanto signora he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse
buona serae grazie niente the cabman drove away singing
mean what george he whispered is it this
is this possible
ill put a marvel to you
that your cousin has always hoped
that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like thisof course very far down
that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped
i cant explain her any other way
can you
look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable
the sight of us haunted heror she couldnt have described us as she did to her friend
there are detailsit burnt
i read the book afterwards
she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through
she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy
we can never make friends with her or thank her
but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad it is impossible murmured lucy and then remembering the experiences of her own heart she said noit is just possible youth enwrapped them the song of phaethon announced passion requited love attained
but they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this
the song died away they heard the river bearing down the snows of winter into the mediterranean
illustration a room with a view by e m forster contents part one chapter i the bertolini the signora had no business to do it said miss bartlett no business at all
she promised us south rooms with a view close together instead of which here are north rooms looking into a courtyard and a long way apart
oh lucy and a cockney besides said lucy who had been further saddened by the signoras unexpected accent
it might be london she looked at the two rows of english people who were sitting at the table at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the english people at the portraits of the late queen and the late poet laureate that hung behind the english people heavily framed at the notice of the english church rev
cuthbert eager m a
oxon
that was the only other decoration of the wall
charlotte dont you feel too that we might be in london
i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside
i suppose it is ones being so tired this meat has surely been used for soup said miss bartlett laying down her fork
i want so to see the arno
the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno
the signora had no business to do it at all
oh it is a shame any nook does for me miss bartlett continued but it does seem hard that you shouldnt have a view lucy felt that she had been selfish
charlotte you mustnt spoil me of course you must look over the arno too
i meant that
the first vacant room in the front you must have it said miss bartlett part of whose travelling expenses were paid by lucys mothera piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion
no no
you must have it i insist on it
your mother would never forgive me lucy she would never forgive me the ladies voices grew animated andif the sad truth be owneda little peevish
they were tired and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled
some of their neighbours interchanged glances and one of themone of the ill bred people whom one does meet abroadleant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument
he said i have a view i have a view miss bartlett was startled
generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking and often did not find out that they would do till they had gone
she knew that the intruder was ill bred even before she glanced at him
he was an old man of heavy build with a fair shaven face and large eyes
there was something childish in those eyes though it was not the childishness of senility
what exactly it was miss bartlett did not stop to consider for her glance passed on to his clothes
these did not attract her
he was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim
so she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her and then said a view
oh a view
how delightful a view is this is my son said the old man his names george
he has a view too ah said miss bartlett repressing lucy who was about to speak
what i mean he continued is that you can have our rooms and well have yours
well change the better class of tourist was shocked at this and sympathized with the new comers
miss bartlett in reply opened her mouth as little as possible and said thank you very much indeed that is out of the question why said the old man with both fists on the table
because it is quite out of the question thank you you see we dont like to take began lucy
her cousin again repressed her
but why he persisted
women like looking at a view men dont and he thumped with his fists like a naughty child and turned to his son saying george persuade them its so obvious they should have the rooms said the son
theres nothing else to say he did not look at the ladies as he spoke but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful
lucy too was perplexed but she saw that they were in for what is known as quite a scene and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt not with rooms and views but withwell with something quite different whose existence she had not realized before
now the old man attacked miss bartlett almost violently why should she not change
what possible objection had she
they would clear out in half an hour
miss bartlett though skilled in the delicacies of conversation was powerless in the presence of brutality
it was impossible to snub any one so gross
her face reddened with displeasure
she looked around as much as to say are you all like this and two little old ladies who were sitting further up the table with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs looked back clearly indicating we are not we are genteel eat your dinner dear she said to lucy and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured
lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite
eat your dinner dear
this pension is a failure
to morrow we will make a change hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it
the curtains at the end of the room parted and revealed a clergyman stout but attractive who hurried forward to take his place at the table cheerfully apologizing for his lateness
lucy who had not yet acquired decency at once rose to her feet exclaiming oh oh
why its mr beebe
oh how perfectly lovely
oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are
oh miss bartlett said with more restraint how do you do mr beebe
i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peters that very cold easter the clergyman who had the air of one on a holiday did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him
but he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by lucy
i am so glad to see you said the girl who was in a state of spiritual starvation and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it
just fancy how small the world is
summer street too makes it so specially funny miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street said miss bartlett filling up the gap and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living yes i heard from mother so last week
she didnt know that i knew you at tunbridge wells but i wrote back at once and i said mr
beebe is quite right said the clergyman
i move into the rectory at summer street next june
i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood oh how glad i am
the name of our house is windy corner mr beebe bowed
there is mother and me generally and my brother though its not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner i am eating it thank you and enjoying it he preferred to talk to lucy whose playing he remembered rather than to miss bartlett who probably remembered his sermons
he asked the girl whether she knew florence well and was informed at some length that she had never been there before
it is delightful to advise a newcomer and he was first in the field
dont neglect the country round his advice concluded
the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort no cried a voice from the top of the table
mr
beebe you are wrong
the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato that lady looks so clever whispered miss bartlett to her cousin
we are in luck and indeed a perfect torrent of information burst on them
people told them what to see when to see it how to stop the electric trams how to get rid of the beggars how much to give for a vellum blotter how much the place would grow upon them
the pension bertolini had decided almost enthusiastically that they would do
whichever way they looked kind ladies smiled and shouted at them
and above all rose the voice of the clever lady crying prato
they must go to prato
that place is too sweetly squalid for words
i love it i revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know the young man named george glanced at the clever lady and then returned moodily to his plate
obviously he and his father did not do
lucy in the midst of her success found time to wish they did
it gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold and when she rose to go she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow
the father did not see it the son acknowledged it not by another bow but by raising his eyebrows and smiling he seemed to be smiling across something
she hastened after her cousin who had already disappeared through the curtainscurtains which smote one in the face and seemed heavy with more than cloth
beyond them stood the unreliable signora bowing good evening to her guests and supported by enery her little boy and victorier her daughter
it made a curious little scene this attempt of the cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the south
and even more curious was the drawing room which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a bloomsbury boarding house
was this really italy
miss bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm chair which had the colour and the contours of a tomato
she was talking to mr beebe and as she spoke her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards slowly regularly as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle
we are most grateful to you she was saying
the first evening means so much
when you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart dheure he expressed his regret
do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner emerson is he a friend of yours we are friendlyas one is in pensions then i will say no more he pressed her very slightly and she said more
i am as it were she concluded the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing
his manner was somewhat unfortunate
i hope i acted for the best you acted very naturally said he
he seemed thoughtful and after a few moments added all the same i dont think much harm would have come of accepting no harm of course
but we could not be under an obligation he is rather a peculiar man again he hesitated and then said gently i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude
he has the meritif it is oneof saying exactly what he means
he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them
he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite
it is so difficultat least i find it difficultto understand people who speak the truth lucy was pleased and said i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice i think he is nice and tiresome
i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expecti may say i hopeyou will differ
but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores
when he first came here he not unnaturally put peoples backs up
he has no tact and no mannersi dont mean by that that he has bad mannersand he will not keep his opinions to himself
we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it am i to conclude said miss bartlett that he is a socialist mr beebe accepted the convenient word not without a slight twitching of the lips
and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too i hardly know george for he hasnt learnt to talk yet
he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains
of course he has all his fathers mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist oh you relieve me said miss bartlett
so you think i ought to have accepted their offer
you feel i have been narrow minded and suspicious not at all he answered i never suggested that but ought i not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness he replied with some irritation that it would be quite unnecessary and got up from his seat to go to the smoking room
was i a bore said miss bartlett as soon as he had disappeared
why didnt you talk lucy
he prefers young people im sure
i do hope i havent monopolized him
i hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinner time he is nice exclaimed lucy
just what i remember
he seems to see good in everyone
no one would take him for a clergyman my dear lucia well you know what i mean
and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man funny girl
how you do remind me of your mother
i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe im sure she will and so will freddy i think everyone at windy corner will approve it is the fashionable world
i am used to tunbridge wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times yes said lucy despondently
there was a haze of disapproval in the air but whether the disapproval was of herself or of mr beebe or of the fashionable world at windy corner or of the narrow world at tunbridge wells she could not determine
she tried to locate it but as usual she blundered
miss bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one and added i am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion and the girl again thought i must have been selfish or unkind i must be more careful
it is so dreadful for charlotte being poor fortunately one of the little old ladies who for some time had been smiling very benignly now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where mr beebe had sat
permission granted she began to chatter gently about italy the plunge it had been to come there the gratifying success of the plunge the improvement in her sisters health the necessity of closing the bed room windows at night and of thoroughly emptying the water bottles in the morning
she handled her subjects agreeably and they were perhaps more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon guelfs and ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room
it was a real catastrophe not a mere episode that evening of hers at venice when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea though one better than something else
but here you are as safe as in england
signora bertolini is so english yet our rooms smell said poor lucy
we dread going to bed ah then you look into the court she sighed
if only mr emerson was more tactful
we were so sorry for you at dinner i think he was meaning to be kind undoubtedly he was said miss bartlett
mr
beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature
of course i was holding back on my cousins account of course said the little old lady and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl
lucy tried to look demure but could not help feeling a great fool
no one was careful with her at home or at all events she had not noticed it
about old mr emersoni hardly know
no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same timebeautiful beautiful said miss bartlett puzzled at the word
are not beauty and delicacy the same so one would have thought said the other helplessly
but things are so difficult i sometimes think she proceeded no further into things for mr beebe reappeared looking extremely pleasant
miss bartlett he cried its all right about the rooms
im so glad
mr emerson was talking about it in the smoking room and knowing what i did i encouraged him to make the offer again
he has let me come and ask you
he would be so pleased oh charlotte cried lucy to her cousin we must have the rooms now
the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be miss bartlett was silent
i fear said mr beebe after a pause that i have been officious
i must apologize for my interference gravely displeased he turned to go
not till then did miss bartlett reply my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours
it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness
if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it
would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally she raised her voice as she spoke it was heard all over the drawing room and silenced the guelfs and the ghibellines
the clergyman inwardly cursing the female sex bowed and departed with her message
remember lucy i alone am implicated in this
i do not wish the acceptance to come from you
grant me that at all events mr beebe was back saying rather nervously mr
emerson is engaged but here is his son instead the young man gazed down on the three ladies who felt seated on the floor so low were their chairs
my father he said is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally
but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out miss bartlett was unequal to the bath
all her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first
young mr emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of mr beebe and to the secret delight of lucy
poor young man said miss bartlett as soon as he had gone
how angry he is with his father about the rooms
it is all he can do to keep polite in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready said mr beebe
then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins he retired to his own rooms to write up his philosophic diary
oh dear breathed the little old lady and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment
gentlemen sometimes do not realize her voice faded away but miss bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part
lucy not realizing either was reduced to literature
taking up baedekers handbook to northern italy she committed to memory the most important dates of florentine history
for she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow
thus the half hour crept profitably away and at last miss bartlett rose with a sigh and said i think one might venture now
no lucy do not stir
i will superintend the move how you do do everything said lucy
naturally dear
it is my affair but i would like to help you no dear charlottes energy
and her unselfishness
she had been thus all her life but really on this italian tour she was surpassing herself
so lucy felt or strove to feel
and yetthere was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful
at all events she entered her own room without any feeling of joy
i want to explain said miss bartlett why it is that i have taken the largest room
naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it lucy was bewildered
if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him
i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to
however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this mother wouldnt mind im sure said lucy but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues
miss bartlett only sighed and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good night
it gave lucy the sensation of a fog and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the arno and the cypresses of san miniato and the foot hills of the apennines black against the rising moon
miss bartlett in her room fastened the window shutters and locked the door and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances
it was then that she saw pinned up over the washstand a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation
nothing more
what does it mean she thought and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle
meaningless at first it gradually became menacing obnoxious portentous with evil
she was seized with an impulse to destroy it but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so since it must be the property of young mr emerson
so she unpinned it carefully and put it between two pieces of blotting paper to keep it clean for him
then she completed her inspection of the room sighed heavily according to her habit and went to bed
chapter ii in santa croce with no baedeker it was pleasant to wake up in florence to open the eyes upon a bright bare room with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons
it was pleasant too to fling wide the windows pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite and close below the arno gurgling against the embankment of the road
over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore and on the river was a boat also diligently employed for some mysterious end
an electric tram came rushing underneath the window
no one was inside it except one tourist but its platforms were overflowing with italians who preferred to stand
children tried to hang on behind and the conductor with no malice spat in their faces to make them let go
then soldiers appearedgood looking undersized menwearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur and a great coat which had been cut for some larger soldier
beside them walked officers looking foolish and fierce and before them went little boys turning somersaults in time with the band
the tramcar became entangled in their ranks and moved on painfully like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants
one of the little boys fell down and some white bullocks came out of an archway
indeed if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button hooks the road might never have got clear
over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away and the traveller who has gone to italy to study the tactile values of giotto or the corruption of the papacy may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it
so it was as well that miss bartlett should tap and come in and having commented on lucys leaving the door unlocked and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed should urge her to hasten herself or the best of the day would be gone
by the time lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs
a conversation then ensued on not unfamiliar lines
miss bartlett was after all a wee bit tired and thought they had better spend the morning settling in unless lucy would at all like to go out
lucy would rather like to go out as it was her first day in florence but of course she could go alone
miss bartlett could not allow this
of course she would accompany lucy everywhere
oh certainly not lucy would stop with her cousin
oh no
that would never do
oh yes
at this point the clever lady broke in
if it is mrs grundy who is troubling you i do assure you that you can neglect the good person
being english miss honeychurch will be perfectly safe
italians understand
a dear friend of mine contessa baroncelli has two daughters and when she cannot send a maid to school with them she lets them go in sailor hats instead
every one takes them for english you see especially if their hair is strained tightly behind miss bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of contessa baroncellis daughters
she was determined to take lucy herself her head not being so very bad
the clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in santa croce and if lucy would come too she would be delighted
i will take you by a dear dirty back way miss honeychurch and if you bring me luck we shall have an adventure lucy said that this was most kind and at once opened the baedeker to see where santa croce was
tut tut
miss lucy
i hope we shall soon emancipate you from baedeker
he does but touch the surface of things
as to the true italyhe does not even dream of it
the true italy is only to be found by patient observation this sounded very interesting and lucy hurried over her breakfast and started with her new friend in high spirits
italy was coming at last
the cockney signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream
miss lavishfor that was the clever ladys nameturned to the right along the sunny lung arno
how delightfully warm
but a wind down the side streets cut like a knife didnt it
ponte alle grazieparticularly interesting mentioned by dante
san miniatobeautiful as well as interesting the crucifix that kissed a murderermiss honeychurch would remember the story
the men on the river were fishing
untrue but then so is most information
then miss lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks and she stopped and she cried a smell
a true florentine smell
every city let me teach you has its own smell is it a very nice smell said lucy who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt
one doesnt come to italy for niceness was the retort one comes for life
buon giorno
buon giorno bowing right and left
look at that adorable wine cart
how the driver stares at us dear simple soul so miss lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of florence short fidgety and playful as a kitten though without a kittens grace
it was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful and a blue military cloak such as an italian officer wears only increased the sense of festivity
buon giorno
take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors
that is the true democracy
though i am a real radical as well
there now youre shocked indeed im not exclaimed lucy
we are radicals too out and out
my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland i see i see
and now you have gone over to the enemy oh please
if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right
and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp shameful
a manufacturing district i suppose noin the surrey hills
about five miles from dorking looking over the weald miss lavish seemed interested and slackened her trot
what a delightful part i know it so well
it is full of the very nicest people
do you know sir harry otwaya radical if ever there was very well indeed and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist why she rents a field of us
how funny miss lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky and murmured oh you have property in surrey hardly any said lucy fearful of being thought a snob
only thirty acresjust the garden all downhill and some fields miss lavish was not disgusted and said it was just the size of her aunts suffolk estate
italy receded
they tried to remember the last name of lady louisa someone who had taken a house near summer street the other year but she had not liked it which was odd of her
and just as miss lavish had got the name she broke off and exclaimed bless us
bless us and save us
weve lost the way certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching santa croce the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window
but miss lavish had said so much about knowing her florence by heart that lucy had followed her with no misgivings
lost
lost
my dear miss lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning
how those horrid conservatives would jeer at us
what are we to do
two lone females in an unknown town
now this is what i call an adventure lucy who wanted to see santa croce suggested as a possible solution that they should ask the way there
oh but that is the word of a craven
and no you are not not not to look at your baedeker
give it to me i shant let you carry it
we will simply drift accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey brown streets neither commodious nor picturesque in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds
lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of lady louisa and became discontented herself
for one ravishing moment italy appeared
she stood in the square of the annunziata and saw in the living terra cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale
there they stood with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven
lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful but miss lavish with a shriek of dismay dragged her forward declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile
the hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins or rather ceases to tell and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop because it looked so typical
it tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped partly of hair oil partly of the great unknown
but it gave them strength to drift into another piazza large and dusty on the farther side of which rose a black and white faade of surpassing ugliness
miss lavish spoke to it dramatically
it was santa croce
the adventure was over
stop a minute let those two people go on or i shall have to speak to them
i do detest conventional intercourse
nasty
they are going into the church too
oh the britisher abroad we sat opposite them at dinner last night
they have given us their rooms
they were so very kind look at their figures laughed miss lavish
they walk through my italy like a pair of cows
its very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldnt pass it what would you ask us miss lavish laid her hand pleasantly on lucys arm as if to suggest that she at all events would get full marks
in this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church and were about to enter it when miss lavish stopped squeaked flung up her arms and cried there goes my local colour box
i must have a word with him and in a moment she was away over the piazza her military cloak flapping in the wind nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers and nipped him playfully upon the arm
lucy waited for nearly ten minutes
then she began to get tired
the beggars worried her the dust blew in her eyes and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places
she descended slowly into the piazza with the intention of rejoining miss lavish who was really almost too original
but at that moment miss lavish and her local colour box moved also and disappeared down a side street both gesticulating largely
tears of indignation came to lucys eyes partly because miss lavish had jilted her partly because she had taken her baedeker
how could she find her way home
how could she find her way about in santa croce
her first morning was ruined and she might never be in florence again
a few minutes ago she had been all high spirits talking as a woman of culture and half persuading herself that she was full of originality
now she entered the church depressed and humiliated not even able to remember whether it was built by the franciscans or the dominicans
of course it must be a wonderful building
but how like a barn
and how very cold
of course it contained frescoes by giotto in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper
but who was to tell her which they were
she walked about disdainfully unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date
there was no one even to tell her which of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts was the one that was really beautiful the one that had been most praised by mr ruskin
then the pernicious charm of italy worked on her and instead of acquiring information she began to be happy
she puzzled out the italian noticesthe notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the churchthe notice that prayed people in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves not to spit
she watched the tourists their noses were as red as their baedekers so cold was santa croce
she beheld the horrible fate that overtook three papiststwo he babies and a she babywho began their career by sousing each other with the holy water and then proceeded to the machiavelli memorial dripping but hallowed
advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances they touched the stone with their fingers with their handkerchiefs with their heads and then retreated
what could this mean
they did it again and again
then lucy realized that they had mistaken machiavelli for some saint hoping to acquire virtue
punishment followed quickly
the smallest he baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by mr ruskin and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop
protestant as she was lucy darted forward
she was too late
he fell heavily upon the prelates upturned toes
hateful bishop exclaimed the voice of old mr emerson who had darted forward also
hard in life hard in death
go out into the sunshine little boy and kiss your hand to the sun for that is where you ought to be
intolerable bishop the child screamed frantically at these words and at these dreadful people who picked him up dusted him rubbed his bruises and told him not to be superstitious
look at him said mr emerson to lucy
heres a mess a baby hurt cold and frightened
but what else can you expect from a church the childs legs had become as melting wax
each time that old mr emerson and lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar
fortunately an italian lady who ought to have been saying her prayers came to the rescue
by some mysterious virtue which mothers alone possess she stiffened the little boys back bone and imparted strength to his knees
he stood
still gibbering with agitation he walked away
you are a clever woman said mr emerson
you have done more than all the relics in the world
i am not of your creed but i do believe in those who make their fellow creatures happy
there is no scheme of the universe he paused for a phrase
niente said the italian lady and returned to her prayers
im not sure she understands english suggested lucy
in her chastened mood she no longer despised the emersons
she was determined to be gracious to them beautiful rather than delicate and if possible to erase miss bartletts civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms
that woman understands everything was mr emersons reply
but what are you doing here
are you doing the church
are you through with the church no cried lucy remembering her grievance
i came here with miss lavish who was to explain everything and just by the doorit is too badshe simply ran away and after waiting quite a time i had to come in by myself why shouldnt you said mr emerson
yes why shouldnt you come by yourself said the son addressing the young lady for the first time
but miss lavish has even taken away baedeker baedeker said mr emerson
im glad its that you minded
its worth minding the loss of a baedeker
thats worth minding lucy was puzzled
she was again conscious of some new idea and was not sure whither it would lead her
if youve no baedeker said the son youd better join us was this where the idea would lead
she took refuge in her dignity
thank you very much but i could not think of that
i hope you do not suppose that i came to join on to you
i really came to help with the child and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night
i hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience my dear said the old man gently i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say
you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really
stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see
to take you to it will be a real pleasure now this was abominably impertinent and she ought to have been furious
but it is sometimes as difficult to lose ones temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it
lucy could not get cross
mr emerson was an old man and surely a girl might humour him
on the other hand his son was a young man and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him or at all events be offended before him
it was at him that she gazed before replying
i am not touchy i hope
it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are the son nodded
with a look of sombre satisfaction he led the way to the peruzzi chapel
there was a hint of the teacher about him
she felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly
the chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer directing them how to worship giotto not by tactful valuations but by the standards of the spirit
remember he was saying the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared
observe how giotto in these frescoesnow unhappily ruined by restorationis untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective
could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true
how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels no exclaimed mr emerson in much too loud a voice for church
remember nothing of the sort
built by faith indeed
that simply means the workmen werent paid properly
and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them
look at that fat man in blue
he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon he was referring to the fresco of the ascension of st john inside the lecturers voice faltered as well it might
the audience shifted uneasily and so did lucy
she was sure that she ought not to be with these men but they had cast a spell over her
they were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave
now did this happen or didnt it
yes or no george replied it happened like this if it happened at all
i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here you will never go up said his father
you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up
it did happen like that if it happened at all pardon me said a frigid voice
the chapel is somewhat small for two parties
we will incommode you no longer the lecturer was a clergyman and his audience must be also his flock for they held prayer books as well as guide books in their hands
they filed out of the chapel in silence
amongst them were the two little old ladies of the pension bertolinimiss teresa and miss catherine alan
stop cried mr emerson
theres plenty of room for us all
stop the procession disappeared without a word
soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel describing the life of st francis
george i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate george went into the next chapel and returned saying perhaps he is
i dont remember then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am
its that mr
eager
why did he go
did we talk too loud
how vexatious
i shall go and say we are sorry
hadnt i better
then perhaps he will come back he will not come back said george
but mr emerson contrite and unhappy hurried away to apologize to the rev
cuthbert eager
lucy apparently absorbed in a lunette could hear the lecture again interrupted the anxious aggressive voice of the old man the curt injured replies of his opponent
the son who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy was listening also
my father has that effect on nearly everyone he informed her
he will try to be kind i hope we all try said she smiling nervously
because we think it improves our characters
but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened how silly of them said lucy though in her heart she sympathized i think that a kind action done tactfully tact he threw up his head in disdain
apparently she had given the wrong answer
she watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel
for a young man his face was rugged anduntil the shadows fell upon ithard
enshadowed it sprang into tenderness
she saw him once again at rome on the ceiling of the sistine chapel carrying a burden of acorns
healthy and muscular he yet gave her the feeling of greyness of tragedy that might only find solution in the night
the feeling soon passed it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle
born of silence and of unknown emotion it passed when mr emerson returned and she could re enter the world of rapid talk which was alone familiar to her
were you snubbed asked his son tranquilly
but we have spoilt the pleasure of i dont know how many people
they wont come back full of innate sympathyquickness to perceive good in othersvision of the brotherhood of man scraps of the lecture on st francis came floating round the partition wall
dont let us spoil yours he continued to lucy
have you looked at those saints yes said lucy
they are lovely
do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in ruskin he did not know and suggested that they should try to guess it
george rather to her relief refused to move and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about santa croce which though it is like a barn has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls
there were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars and an old lady with her dog and here and there a priest modestly edging to his mass through the groups of tourists
but mr emerson was only half interested
he watched the lecturer whose success he believed he had impaired and then he anxiously watched his son
why will he look at that fresco he said uneasily
i saw nothing in it i like giotto she replied
it is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values
though i like things like the della robbia babies better so you ought
a baby is worth a dozen saints
and my babys worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell lucy again felt that this did not do
in hell he repeated
hes unhappy oh dear said lucy
how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive
what more is one to give him
and think how he has been brought upfree from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god
with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy she was no theologian but she felt that here was a very foolish old man as well as a very irreligious one
she also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person and that charlotte would object most strongly
what are we to do with him he asked
he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaveslike that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone
eh
what did you say lucy had made no suggestion
suddenly he said now dont be stupid over this
i dont require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him
you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible
you might help me
he has known so few women and you have the time
you stop here several weeks i suppose
but let yourself go
you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night
let yourself go
pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them
by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself
it will be good for both of you to this extraordinary speech lucy found no answer
i only know what it is thats wrong with him not why it is and what is it asked lucy fearfully expecting some harrowing tale
the old trouble things wont fit what things the things of the universe
it is quite true
they dont oh mr emerson whatever do you mean in his ordinary voice so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry he said from far from eve and morning the stuff of life to knit me george and i both know this but why does it distress him
we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness
but why should this make us unhappy
let us rather love one another and work and rejoice
i dont believe in this world sorrow miss honeychurch assented
then make my boy think like us
make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yesa transitory yes if you like but a yes suddenly she laughed surely one ought to laugh
a young man melancholy because the universe wouldnt fit because life was a tangle or a wind or a yes or something
im very sorry she cried
youll think me unfeeling butbut then she became matronly
oh but your son wants employment
has he no particular hobby
why i myself have worries but i can generally forget them at the piano and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother
perhaps italy bores him you ought to try the alps or the lakes the old mans face saddened and he touched her gently with his hand
this did not alarm her she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it
indeed he no longer alarmed her at all she regarded him as a kind thing but quite silly
her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically before she lost baedeker
the dear george now striding towards them over the tombstones seemed both pitiable and absurd
he approached his face in the shadow
he said miss bartlett oh good gracious me said lucy suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective
where
where in the nave i see
those gossiping little miss alans must have she checked herself
poor girl exploded mr emerson
poor girl she could not let this pass for it was just what she was feeling herself
poor girl
i fail to understand the point of that remark
i think myself a very fortunate girl i assure you
im thoroughly happy and having a splendid time
pray dont waste time mourning over me
theres enough sorrow in the world isnt there without trying to invent it
good bye
thank you both so much for all your kindness
ah yes
there does come my cousin
a delightful morning
santa croce is a wonderful church she joined her cousin
chapter iii music violets and the letter s it so happened that lucy who found daily life rather chaotic entered a more solid world when she opened the piano
she was then no longer either deferential or patronizing no longer either a rebel or a slave
the kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected
the commonplace person begins to play and shoots into the empyrean without effort whilst we look up marvelling how he has escaped us and thinking how we could worship him and love him would he but translate his visions into human words and his experiences into human actions
perhaps he cannot certainly he does not or does so very seldom
lucy had done so never
she was no dazzling excutante her runs were not at all like strings of pearls and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation
nor was she the passionate young lady who performs so tragically on a summers evening with the window open
passion was there but it could not be easily labelled it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy and all the furniture of the pictorial style
and she was tragical only in the sense that she was great for she loved to play on the side of victory
victory of what and over whatthat is more than the words of daily life can tell us
but that some sonatas of beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides and lucy had decided that they should triumph
a very wet afternoon at the bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked and after lunch she opened the little draped piano
a few people lingered round and praised her playing but finding that she made no reply dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep
she took no notice of mr emerson looking for his son nor of miss bartlett looking for miss lavish nor of miss lavish looking for her cigarette case
like every true performer she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes they were fingers caressing her own and by touch not by sound alone did she come to her desire
mr beebe sitting unnoticed in the window pondered this illogical element in miss honeychurch and recalled the occasion at tunbridge wells when he had discovered it
it was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower
the seats were filled with a respectful audience and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish under the auspices of their vicar sang or recited or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork
among the promised items was miss honeychurch
piano
beethoven and mr beebe was wondering whether it would be adelaida or the march of the ruins of athens when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of opus iii
he was in suspense all through the introduction for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends
with the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory
he was glad that she only played the first movement for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine sixteen
the audience clapped no less respectful
it was mr beebe who started the stamping it was all that one could do
who is she he asked the vicar afterwards
cousin of one of my parishioners
i do not consider her choice of a piece happy
beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs introduce me she will be delighted
she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon my sermon cried mr beebe
why ever did she listen to it when he was introduced he understood why for miss honeychurch disjoined from her music stool was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty pale undeveloped face
she loved going to concerts she loved stopping with her cousin she loved iced coffee and meringues
he did not doubt that she loved his sermon also
but before he left tunbridge wells he made a remark to the vicar which he now made to lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him if miss honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays it will be very exciting both for us and for her lucy at once re entered daily life
oh what a funny thing
some one said just the same to mother and she said she trusted i should never live a duet doesnt mrs honeychurch like music she doesnt mind it
but she doesnt like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it
she thinksi cant make out
once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any ones
she has never got over it
of course i didnt mean that i played well i only meant of course said he wondering why she bothered to explain
music said lucy as if attempting some generality
she could not complete it and looked out absently upon italy in the wet
the whole life of the south was disorganized and the most graceful nation in europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes
the street and the river were dirty yellow the bridge was dirty grey and the hills were dirty purple
somewhere in their folds were concealed miss lavish and miss bartlett who had chosen this afternoon to visit the torre del gallo
what about music said mr beebe
poor charlotte will be sopped was lucys reply
the expedition was typical of miss bartlett who would return cold tired hungry and angelic with a ruined skirt a pulpy baedeker and a tickling cough in her throat
on another day when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth like wine she would refuse to stir from the drawing room saying that she was an old thing and no fit companion for a hearty girl
miss lavish has led your cousin astray
she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe miss lavish is so original murmured lucy
this was a stock remark the supreme achievement of the pension bertolini in the way of definition
miss lavish was so original
mr beebe had his doubts but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness
for that and for other reasons he held his peace
is it true continued lucy in awe struck tone that miss lavish is writing a book they do say so what is it about it will be a novel replied mr beebe dealing with modern italy
let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know i wish miss lavish would tell me herself
we started such friends
but i dont think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce
charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldnt help being a little annoyed with miss lavish the two ladies at all events have made it up he was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as miss bartlett and miss lavish
they were always in each others company with lucy a slighted third
miss lavish he believed he understood but miss bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness though not perhaps of meaning
was italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon which he had assigned to her at tunbridge wells
all his life he had loved to study maiden ladies they were his specialty and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work
girls like lucy were charming to look at but mr beebe was from rather profound reasons somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled
lucy for the third time said that poor charlotte would be sopped
the arno was rising in flood washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore
but in the south west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse
she opened the window to inspect and a cold blast entered the room drawing a plaintive cry from miss catharine alan who entered at the same moment by the door
oh dear miss honeychurch you will catch a chill
and mr beebe here besides
who would suppose this is italy
there is my sister actually nursing the hot water can no comforts or proper provisions she sidled towards them and sat down self conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man or a man and one woman
i could hear your beautiful playing miss honeychurch though i was in my room with the door shut
doors shut indeed most necessary
no one has the least idea of privacy in this country
and one person catches it from another lucy answered suitably
mr beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at modena where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath exclaiming cheerfully fa niente sono vecchia he contented himself with saying i quite agree with you miss alan
the italians are a most unpleasant people
they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves
we are at their mercy
they read our thoughts they foretell our desires
from the cab driver down toto giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it
yet in their heart of hearts they arehow superficial
they have no conception of the intellectual life
how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day ho mr beebe if you knew what i suffer over the childrens edjucaishion
hi wont ave my little victorier taught by a hignorant italian what cant explain nothink miss alan did not follow but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way
her sister was a little disappointed in mr beebe having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers
indeed who would have supposed that tolerance sympathy and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form
in the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle and at last the cause was disclosed
from the chair beneath her she extracted a gun metal cigarette case on which were powdered in turquoise the initials e
l that belongs to lavish said the clergyman
a good fellow lavish but i wish shed start a pipe oh mr beebe said miss alan divided between awe and mirth
indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose
she took to it practically in despair after her lifes work was carried away in a landslip
surely that makes it more excusable what was that asked lucy
mr beebe sat back complacently and miss alan began as follows it was a noveland i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel
it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do
anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink
she said can i have a little ink please but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written
the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes
it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel
she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colourthis novel is to be about modern italy the other was historicalbut that she could not start till she had an idea
first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came herethis must on no account get round
and so cheerful through it all
i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them miss alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement
a delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks giving them unexpected beauty just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring
she felt she had made almost too many allowances and apologized hurriedly for her toleration
all the same she is a little tooi hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived mr beebe smiled as miss alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman
i dont know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade
that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely her jaw dropped
she was silent
mr beebe whose social resources were endless went out to order some tea and she continued to lucy in a hasty whisper stomach
he warned miss pole of her stomach acidity he called itand he may have meant to be kind
i must say i forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden
as teresa truly said it was no laughing matter
but the point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning s and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought
she thought they were commercial travellersdrummers was the word she usedand all through dinner she tried to prove that england our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce
teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so there miss lavish is one who can confute you better than i and pointed to that beautiful picture of lord tennyson
then miss lavish said tut
the early victorians just imagine
tut
the early victorians my sister had gone and i felt bound to speak
i said miss lavish i am an early victorian at least that is to say i will hear no breath of censure against our dear queen it was horrible speaking
i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did not want to go and i must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply
but unluckily mr emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice quite so quite so
i honour the woman for her irish visit the woman
i tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of s having been mentioned in the first place
but that was not all
after dinner miss lavish actually came up and said miss alan i am going into the smoking room to talk to those two nice men
come too needless to say i refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all university men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers let me finish the story said mr beebe who had returned
miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said i shall go alone she went
at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience whatever happened cried lucy
no one knows
no one will ever know
miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling mr
beebeold mr emerson is he nice or not nice
i do so want to know mr beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself
no but it is so difficult
sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him
miss alan what do you think
is he nice the little old lady shook her head and sighed disapprovingly
mr beebe whom the conversation amused stirred her up by saying i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets violets
oh dear
who told you about the violets
how do things get round
a pension is a bad place for gossips
no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eagers lecture at santa croce
oh poor miss honeychurch
it really was too bad
no i have quite changed
i do not like the emersons
they are not nice mr beebe smiled nonchalantly
he had made a gentle effort to introduce the emersons into bertolini society and the effort had failed
he was almost the only person who remained friendly to them
miss lavish who represented intellect was avowedly hostile and now the miss alans who stood for good breeding were following her
miss bartlett smarting under an obligation would scarcely be civil
the case of lucy was different
she had given him a hazy account of her adventures in santa croce and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her to show her the world from their own strange standpoint to interest her in their private sorrows and joys
this was impertinent he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl he would rather it should fail
after all he knew nothing about them and pension joys pension sorrows are flimsy things whereas lucy would be his parishioner
lucy with one eye upon the weather finally said that she thought the emersons were nice not that she saw anything of them now
even their seats at dinner had been moved
but arent they always waylaying you to go out with them dear said the little lady inquisitively
only once
charlotte didnt like it and said somethingquite politely of course most right of her
they dont understand our ways
they must find their level mr beebe rather felt that they had gone under
they had given up their attemptif it was oneto conquer society and now the father was almost as silent as the son
he wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they leftsome expedition perhaps with lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them
it was one of mr beebes chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories
evening approached while they chatted the air became brighter the colours on the trees and hills were purified and the arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle
there were a few streaks of bluish green among the clouds a few patches of watery light upon the earth and then the dripping faade of san miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun
too late to go out said miss alan in a voice of relief
all the galleries are shut i think i shall go out said lucy
i want to go round the town in the circular tramon the platform by the driver her two companions looked grave
mr beebe who felt responsible for her in the absence of miss bartlett ventured to say i wish we could
unluckily i have letters
if you do want to go out alone wont you be better on your feet italians dear you know said miss alan
perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through but they still looked disapproval and she so far conceded to mr beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk and keep to the street frequented by tourists
she oughtnt really to go at all said mr beebe as they watched her from the window and she knows it
i put it down to too much beethoven chapter iv fourth chapter mr beebe was right
lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music
she had not really appreciated the clergymans wit nor the suggestive twitterings of miss alan
conversation was tedious she wanted something big and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind swept platform of an electric tram
this she might not attempt
it was unladylike
why
why were most big things unladylike
charlotte had once explained to her why
it was not that ladies were inferior to men it was that they were different
their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves
indirectly by means of tact and a spotless name a lady could accomplish much
but if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured then despised and finally ignored
poems had been written to illustrate this point
there is much that is immortal in this medieval lady
the dragons have gone and so have the knights but still she lingers in our midst
she reigned in many an early victorian castle and was queen of much early victorian song
it is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well
but alas
the creature grows degenerate
in her heart also there are springing up strange desires
she too is enamoured of heavy winds and vast panoramas and green expanses of the sea
she has marked the kingdom of this world how full it is of wealth and beauty and wara radiant crust built around the central fires spinning towards the receding heavens
men declaring that she inspires them to it move joyfully over the surface having the most delightful meetings with other men happy not because they are masculine but because they are alive
before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the eternal woman and go there as her transitory self
lucy does not stand for the medieval lady who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious
nor has she any system of revolt
here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly and she would transgress it and perhaps be sorry that she had done so
this afternoon she was peculiarly restive
she would really like to do something of which her well wishers disapproved
as she might not go on the electric tram she went to alinaris shop
there she bought a photograph of botticellis birth of venus venus being a pity spoilt the picture otherwise so charming and miss bartlett had persuaded her to do without it
a pity in art of course signified the nude
giorgiones tempesta the idolino some of the sistine frescoes and the apoxyomenos were added to it
she felt a little calmer then and bought fra angelicos coronation giottos ascension of st john some della robbia babies and some guido reni madonnas
for her taste was catholic and she extended uncritical approval to every well known name
but though she spent nearly seven lire the gates of liberty seemed still unopened
she was conscious of her discontent it was new to her to be conscious of it
the world she thought is certainly full of beautiful things if only i could come across them it was not surprising that mrs honeychurch disapproved of music declaring that it always left her daughter peevish unpractical and touchy
nothing ever happens to me she reflected as she entered the piazza signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels now fairly familiar to her
the great square was in shadow the sunshine had come too late to strike it
neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight half god half ghost and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge
the loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave wherein many a deity shadowy but immortal looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind
it was the hour of unrealitythe hour that is when unfamiliar things are real
an older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him and rest content
lucy desired more
she fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold
it seemed no longer a tower no longer supported by earth but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky
its brightness mesmerized her still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home
then something did happen
two italians by the loggia had been bickering about a debt
cinque lire they had cried cinque lire they sparred at each other and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest
he frowned he bent towards lucy with a look of interest as if he had an important message for her
he opened his lips to deliver it and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin
that was all
a crowd rose out of the dusk
it hid this extraordinary man from her and bore him away to the fountain
mr george emerson happened to be a few paces away looking at her across the spot where the man had been
how very odd
across something
even as she caught sight of him he grew dim the palace itself grew dim swayed above her fell on to her softly slowly noiselessly and the sky fell with it
she thought oh what have i done oh what have i done she murmured and opened her eyes
george emerson still looked at her but not across anything
she had complained of dullness and lo
one man was stabbed and another held her in his arms
they were sitting on some steps in the uffizi arcade
he must have carried her
he rose when she spoke and began to dust his knees
she repeated oh what have i done you fainted ii am very sorry how are you now perfectly wellabsolutely well and she began to nod and smile
then let us come home
theres no point in our stopping he held out his hand to pull her up
she pretended not to see it
the cries from the fountainthey had never ceasedrang emptily
the whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning
how very kind you have been
i might have hurt myself falling
but now i am well
i can go alone thank you his hand was still extended
oh my photographs she exclaimed suddenly
what photographs i bought some photographs at alinaris
i must have dropped them out there in the square she looked at him cautiously
would you add to your kindness by fetching them he added to his kindness
as soon as he had turned his back lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the arno
miss honeychurch she stopped with her hand on her heart
you sit still you arent fit to go home alone yes i am thank you so very much no you arent
youd go openly if you were but i had rather then i dont fetch your photographs i had rather be alone he said imperiously the man is deadthe man is probably dead sit down till you are rested she was bewildered and obeyed him
and dont move till i come back in the distance she saw creatures with black hoods such as appear in dreams
the palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day and joined itself to earth
how should she talk to mr emerson when he returned from the shadowy square
again the thought occurred to her oh what have i donethe thought that she as well as the dying man had crossed some spiritual boundary
he returned and she talked of the murder
oddly enough it was an easy topic
she spoke of the italian character she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before
being strong physically she soon overcame the horror of blood
she rose without his assistance and though wings seemed to flutter inside her she walked firmly enough towards the arno
there a cabman signalled to them they refused him
and the murderer tried to kiss him you sayhow very odd italians areand gave himself up to the police
mr beebe was saying that italians know everything but i think they are rather childish
when my cousin and i were at the pitti yesterdaywhat was that he had thrown something into the stream
what did you throw in things i didnt want he said crossly
mr
emerson well where are the photographs he was silent
i believe it was my photographs that you threw away i didnt know what to do with them he cried and his voice was that of an anxious boy
her heart warmed towards him for the first time
they were covered with blood
there
im glad ive told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them he pointed down stream
theyve gone the river swirled under the bridge i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the seai dont know i may just mean that they frightened me then the boy verged into a man
for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled
it isnt exactly that a man has died something warned lucy that she must stop him
it has happened he repeated and i mean to find out what it is mr
emerson he turned towards her frowning as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest
i want to ask you something before we go in they were close to their pension
she stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment
he did likewise
there is at times a magic in identity of position it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship
she moved her elbows before saying i have behaved ridiculously he was following his own thoughts
i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me i nearly fainted myself he said but she felt that her attitude repelled him
well i owe you a thousand apologies oh all right andthis is the real pointyou know how silly people are gossipingladies especially i am afraidyou understand what i mean im afraid i dont i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour your behaviour
oh yes all rightall right thank you so much
and would you she could not carry her request any further
the river was rushing below them almost black in the advancing night
he had thrown her photographs into it and then he had told her the reason
it struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man
he would do her no harm by idle gossip he was trustworthy intelligent and even kind he might even have a high opinion of her
but he lacked chivalry his thoughts like his behaviour would not be modified by awe
it was useless to say to him and would you and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture
she had been in his arms and he remembered it just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in alinaris shop
it was not exactly that a man had died something had happened to the living they had come to a situation where character tells and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of youth
well thank you so much she repeated how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life i dont anxiety moved her to question him
his answer was puzzling i shall probably want to live but why mr emerson
what do you mean i shall want to live i say leaning her elbows on the parapet she contemplated the river arno whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears
chapter v possibilities of a pleasant outing it was a family saying that you never knew which way charlotte bartlett would turn she was perfectly pleasant and sensible over lucys adventure found the abridged account of it quite adequate and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of mr george emerson
she and miss lavish had had an adventure also
they had been stopped at the dazio coming back and the young officials there who seemed impudent and dsuvr had tried to search their reticules for provisions
it might have been most unpleasant
fortunately miss lavish was a match for any one
for good or for evil lucy was left to face her problem alone
none of her friends had seen her either in the piazza or later on by the embankment
mr beebe indeed noticing her startled eyes at dinner time had again passed to himself the remark of too much beethoven but he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure not that she had encountered it
this solitude oppressed her she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or at all events contradicted it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong
at breakfast next morning she took decisive action
there were two plans between which she had to choose
mr beebe was walking up to the torre del gallo with the emersons and some american ladies
would miss bartlett and miss honeychurch join the party
charlotte declined for herself she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon
but she thought it an admirable idea for lucy who hated shopping changing money fetching letters and other irksome dutiesall of which miss bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone
no charlotte cried the girl with real warmth
its very kind of mr beebe but i am certainly coming with you
i had much rather very well dear said miss bartlett with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of lucy
how abominably she behaved to charlotte now as always
but now she should alter
all morning she would be really nice to her
she slipped her arm into her cousins and they started off along the lung arno
the river was a lion that morning in strength voice and colour
miss bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it
she then made her usual remark which was how i do wish freddy and your mother could see this too lucy fidgeted it was tiresome of charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did
look lucia
oh you are watching for the torre del gallo party
i feared you would repent you of your choice serious as the choice had been lucy did not repent
yesterday had been a muddlequeer and odd the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paperbut she had a feeling that charlotte and her shopping were preferable to george emerson and the summit of the torre del gallo
since she could not unravel the tangle she must take care not to re enter it
she could protest sincerely against miss bartletts insinuations
but though she had avoided the chief actor the scenery unfortunately remained
charlotte with the complacency of fate led her from the river to the piazza signoria
she could not have believed that stones a loggia a fountain a palace tower would have such significance
for a moment she understood the nature of ghosts
the exact site of the murder was occupied not by a ghost but by miss lavish who had the morning newspaper in her hand
she hailed them briskly
the dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book
oh let me congratulate you said miss bartlett
after your despair of yesterday
what a fortunate thing aha
miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck
now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning lucy poked at the ground with her parasol
but perhaps you would rather not im sorryif you could manage without it i think i would rather not the elder ladies exchanged glances not of disapproval it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply
it is i who am sorry said miss lavish literary hacks are shameless creatures
i believe theres no secret of the human heart into which we wouldnt pry she marched cheerfully to the fountain and back and did a few calculations in realism
then she said that she had been in the piazza since eight oclock collecting material
a good deal of it was unsuitable but of course one always had to adapt
the two men had quarrelled over a five franc note
for the five franc note she should substitute a young lady which would raise the tone of the tragedy and at the same time furnish an excellent plot
what is the heroines name asked miss bartlett
leonora said miss lavish her own name was eleanor
i do hope shes nice that desideratum would not be omitted
and what is the plot love murder abduction revenge was the plot
but it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun
i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this miss lavish concluded
it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people
of course this is the barest outline
there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters
and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist oh you wicked woman cried miss bartlett
i am sure you are thinking of the emersons miss lavish gave a machiavellian smile
i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen
it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can
for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterdays is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life there was a fitting silence when miss lavish had concluded
then the cousins wished success to her labours and walked slowly away across the square
she is my idea of a really clever woman said miss bartlett
that last remark struck me as so particularly true
it should be a most pathetic novel lucy assented
at present her great aim was not to get put into it
her perceptions this morning were curiously keen and she believed that miss lavish had her on trial for an ingenu
she is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word continued miss bartlett slowly
none but the superficial would be shocked at her
we had a long talk yesterday
she believes in justice and truth and human interest
she told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of womanmr
eager
why how nice
what a pleasant surprise ah not for me said the chaplain blandly for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time we were chatting to miss lavish his brow contracted
so i saw
were you indeed
andate via
sono occupato the last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile
i am about to venture a suggestion
would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this weeka drive in the hills
we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano
there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hours ramble on the hillside
the view thence of florence is most beautifulfar better than the hackneyed view of fiesole
it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures
that man had a decided feeling for landscape
decidedly
but who looks at it to day
ah the world is too much for us miss bartlett had not heard of alessio baldovinetti but she knew that mr
eager was no commonplace chaplain
he was a member of the residential colony who had made florence their home
he knew the people who never walked about with baedekers who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them
living in delicate seclusion some in furnished flats others in renaissance villas on fiesoles slope they read wrote studied and exchanged ideas thus attaining to that intimate knowledge or rather perception of florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of cook
therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of
between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent
tea at a renaissance villa
nothing had been said about it yet
but if it did come to thathow lucy would enjoy it
a few days ago and lucy would have felt the same
but the joys of life were grouping themselves anew
a drive in the hills with mr
eager and miss bartletteven if culminating in a residential tea partywas no longer the greatest of them
she echoed the raptures of charlotte somewhat faintly
only when she heard that mr beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere
so we shall be a partie carre said the chaplain
in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity
andate via
andate presto presto
ah the town
beautiful as it is it is the town they assented
this very squareso i am toldwitnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies
to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecrationportentous and humiliating humiliating indeed said miss bartlett
miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened
she can hardly bear to speak of it she glanced at lucy proudly
and how came we to have you here asked the chaplain paternally
miss bartletts recent liberalism oozed away at the question
do not blame her please mr
eager
the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned so you were here alone miss honeychurch his voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable
his dark handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply
practically one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home said miss bartlett adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver
for her also it must have been a terrible experience
i trust that neither of you was at allthat it was not in your immediate proximity of the many things lucy was noticing to day not the least remarkable was this the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood
george emerson had kept the subject strangely pure
he died by the fountain i believe was her reply
and you and your friend were over at the loggia that must have saved you much
you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter pressthis man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views surely the vendor of photographs was in league with lucyin the eternal league of italy with youth
he had suddenly extended his book before miss bartlett and mr
eager binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches pictures and views
this is too much cried the chaplain striking petulantly at one of fra angelicos angels
she tore
a shrill cry rose from the vendor
the book it seemed was more valuable than one would have supposed
willingly would i purchase began miss bartlett
ignore him said mr
eager sharply and they all walked rapidly away from the square
but an italian can never be ignored least of all when he has a grievance
his mysterious persecution of mr
eager became relentless the air rang with his threats and lamentations
he appealed to lucy would not she intercede
he was poorhe sheltered a familythe tax on bread
he waited he gibbered he was recompensed he was dissatisfied he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant
shopping was the topic that now ensued
under the chaplains guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoesflorid little picture frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry other little frames more severe that stood on little easels and were carven out of oak a blotting book of vellum a dante of the same material cheap mosaic brooches which the maids next christmas would never tell from real pins pots heraldic saucers brown art photographs eros and psyche in alabaster st peter to matchall of which would have cost less in london
this successful morning left no pleasant impressions on lucy
she had been a little frightened both by miss lavish and by mr
eager she knew not why
and as they frightened her she had strangely enough ceased to respect them
she doubted that miss lavish was a great artist
she doubted that mr
eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose
they were tried by some new test and they were found wanting
as for charlotteas for charlotte she was exactly the same
it might be possible to be nice to her it was impossible to love her
the son of a labourer i happen to know it for a fact
a mechanic of some sort himself when he was young then he took to writing for the socialistic press
i came across him at brixton they were talking about the emersons
how wonderfully people rise in these days sighed miss bartlett fingering a model of the leaning tower of pisa
generally replied mr
eager one has only sympathy for their success
the desire for education and for social advancein these things there is something not wholly vile
there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florencelittle as they would make of it is he a journalist now miss bartlett asked
he is not he made an advantageous marriage he uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning and ended with a sigh
oh so he has a wife dead miss bartlett dead
i wonderyes i wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me
he was in my london parish long ago
the other day in santa croce when he was with miss honeychurch i snubbed him
let him beware that he does not get more than a snub what cried lucy flushing
exposure hissed mr
eager
he tried to change the subject but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended
miss bartlett was full of very natural curiosity
lucy though she wished never to see the emersons again was not disposed to condemn them on a single word
do you mean she asked that he is an irreligious man
we know that already lucy dear said miss bartlett gently reproving her cousins penetration
i should be astonished if you knew all
the boyan innocent child at the timei will exclude
god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him perhaps said miss bartlett it is something that we had better not hear to speak plainly said mr
eager it is
i will say no more for the first time lucys rebellious thoughts swept out in wordsfor the first time in her life
you have said very little it was my intention to say very little was his frigid reply
he gazed indignantly at the girl who met him with equal indignation
she turned towards him from the shop counter her breast heaved quickly
he observed her brow and the sudden strength of her lips
it was intolerable that she should disbelieve him
murder if you want to know he cried angrily
that man murdered his wife how she retorted
to all intents and purposes he murdered her
that day in santa crocedid they say anything against me not a word mr eagernot a single word oh i thought they had been libelling me to you
but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them im not defending them said lucy losing her courage and relapsing into the old chaotic methods
theyre nothing to me how could you think she was defending them said miss bartlett much discomfited by the unpleasant scene
the shopman was possibly listening
she will find it difficult
for that man has murdered his wife in the sight of god the addition of god was striking
but the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark
a silence followed which might have been impressive but was merely awkward
then miss bartlett hastily purchased the leaning tower and led the way into the street
i must be going said he shutting his eyes and taking out his watch
miss bartlett thanked him for his kindness and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive
drive
oh is our drive to come off lucy was recalled to her manners and after a little exertion the complacency of mr
eager was restored
bother the drive exclaimed the girl as soon as he had departed
it is just the drive we had arranged with mr beebe without any fuss at all
why should he invite us in that absurd manner
we might as well invite him
we are each paying for ourselves miss bartlett who had intended to lament over the emersons was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts
if that is so dearif the drive we and mr beebe are going with mr
eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr beebe then i foresee a sad kettle of fish how because mr beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come too that will mean another carriage far worse
mr
eager does not like eleanor
she knows it herself
the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him they were now in the newspaper room at the english bank
lucy stood by the central table heedless of punch and the graphic trying to answer or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain
the well known world had broken up and there emerged florence a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things
murder accusations of murder a lady clinging to one man and being rude to anotherwere these the daily incidents of her streets
was there more in her frank beauty than met the eyethe power perhaps to evoke passions good and bad and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment
happy charlotte who though greatly troubled over things that did not matter seemed oblivious to things that did who could conjecture with admirable delicacy where things might lead to but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it
now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck
she had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in italy it must only be broached within the walls of the english bank
as she groped she murmured whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr
eager or mr
eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogetherwhich they could scarcely dobut in any case we must be prepared
it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances
you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind
a one horse carriage would do for us
yet how difficult it is it is indeed replied the girl with a gravity that sounded sympathetic
what do you think about it asked miss bartlett flushed from the struggle and buttoning up her dress
i dont know what i think nor what i want oh dear lucy
i do hope florence isnt boring you
speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth to morrow thank you charlotte said lucy and pondered over the offer
there were letters for her at the bureauone from her brother full of athletics and biology one from her mother delightful as only her mothers letters could be
she had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce of the new parlour maid who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade of the semi detached cottages which were ruining summer street and breaking the heart of sir harry otway
she recalled the free pleasant life of her home where she was allowed to do everything and where nothing ever happened to her
the road up through the pine woods the clean drawing room the view over the sussex wealdall hung before her bright and distinct but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which after much experience a traveller returns
and the news asked miss bartlett
mrs
vyse and her son have gone to rome said lucy giving the news that interested her least
do you know the vyses oh not that way back
we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria theyre nice people the vyses
so clevermy idea of whats really clever
dont you long to be in rome i die for it the piazza signoria is too stony to be brilliant
it has no grass no flowers no frescoes no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick
by an odd chanceunless we believe in a presiding genius of placesthe statues that relieve its severity suggest not the innocence of childhood nor the glorious bewilderment of youth but the conscious achievements of maturity
perseus and judith hercules and thusnelda they have done or suffered something and though they are immortal immortality has come to them after experience not before
here not only in the solitude of nature might a hero meet a goddess or a heroine a god
charlotte cried the girl suddenly
heres an idea
what if we popped off to rome to morrowstraight to the vyses hotel
for i do know what i want
im sick of florence
no you said youd go to the ends of the earth
do
do miss bartlett with equal vivacity replied oh you droll person
pray what would become of your drive in the hills they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square laughing over the unpractical suggestion
chapter vi the reverend arthur beebe the reverend cuthbert eager mr emerson mr george emerson miss eleanor lavish miss charlotte bartlett and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a view italians drive them
it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day a youth all irresponsibility and fire recklessly urging his masters horses up the stony hill
mr beebe recognized him at once
neither the ages of faith nor the age of doubt had touched him he was phaethon in tuscany driving a cab
and it was persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way saying that she was his sisterpersephone tall and slender and pale returning with the spring to her mothers cottage and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light
to her mr
eager objected saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge and one must guard against imposition
but the ladies interceded and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god
phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist
she did not mind
mr
eager who sat with his back to the horses saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding and continued his conversation with lucy
the other two occupants of the carriage were old mr emerson and miss lavish
for a dreadful thing had happened mr beebe without consulting mr
eager had doubled the size of the party
and though miss bartlett and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads and miss lavish got in with lucy while miss bartlett with george emerson and mr beebe followed on behind
it was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carre thus transformed
tea at a renaissance villa if he had ever meditated it was now impossible
lucy and miss bartlett had a certain style about them and mr beebe though unreliable was a man of parts
but a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of godthey should enter no villa at his introduction
lucy elegantly dressed in white sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients attentive to mr
eager repressive towards miss lavish watchful of old mr emerson hitherto fortunately asleep thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of spring
she looked on the expedition as the work of fate
but for it she would have avoided george emerson successfully
in an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy
she had refused not because she disliked him but because she did not know what had happened and suspected that he did know
and this frightened her
for the real eventwhatever it washad taken place not in the loggia but by the river
to behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable
but to discuss it afterwards to pass from discussion into silence and through silence into sympathy that is an error not of a startled emotion but of the whole fabric
there was really something blameworthy she thought in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word
this sense of wickedness had been slight at first
she had nearly joined the party to the torre del gallo
but each time that she avoided george it became more imperative that she should avoid him again
and now celestial irony working through her cousin and two clergymen did not suffer her to leave florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills
meanwhile mr
eager held her in civil converse their little tiff was over
so miss honeychurch you are travelling
as a student of art oh dear me nooh no perhaps as a student of human nature interposed miss lavish like myself oh no
i am here as a tourist oh indeed said mr
eager
are you indeed
if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a littlehanded about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else
the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl
you know the american girl in punch who says say poppa what did we see at rome and the father replies why guess rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog theres travelling for you
ha
ha
ha i quite agree said miss lavish who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit
the narrowness and superficiality of the anglo saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace quite so
now the english colony at florence miss honeychurchand it is of considerable size though of course not all equallya few are here for trade for example
but the greater part are students
lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico
i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left
no you can only see it if you standno do not stand you will fall
she is very proud of that thick hedge
inside perfect seclusion
one might have gone back six hundred years
some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not it does indeed cried miss lavish
tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day but mr
eager proceeded to tell miss honeychurch that on the right lived mr
someone something an american of the best typeso rareand that the somebody elses were farther down the hill
doubtless you know her monographs in the series of medival byways
he is working at gemistus pletho
sometimes as i take tea in their beautiful grounds i hear over the wall the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot dusty unintelligent tourists who are going to do fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there and i thinkthinki think how little they think what lies so near them during this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully
lucy had a spasm of envy
granted that they wished to misbehave it was pleasant for them to be able to do so
they were probably the only people enjoying the expedition
the carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the piazza of fiesole and into the settignano road
piano
piano said mr
eager elegantly waving his hand over his head
va bene signore va bene va bene crooned the driver and whipped his horses up again
now mr
eager and miss lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of alessio baldovinetti
was he a cause of the renaissance or was he one of its manifestations
the other carriage was left behind
as the pace increased to a gallop the large slumbering form of mr emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine
piano
piano said he with a martyred look at lucy
an extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat
phaethon who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss persephone had just succeeded
a little scene ensued which as miss bartlett said afterwards was most unpleasant
the horses were stopped the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves the boy was to lose his pourboire the girl was immediately to get down
she is my sister said he turning round on them with piteous eyes
mr
eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar
phaethon hung down his head not at the matter of the accusation but at its manner
at this point mr emerson whom the shock of stopping had awoke declared that the lovers must on no account be separated and patted them on the back to signify his approval
and miss lavish though unwilling to ally him felt bound to support the cause of bohemianism
most certainly i would let them be she cried
but i dare say i shall receive scant support
i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life
this is what i call an adventure we must not submit said mr
eager
i knew he was trying it on
he is treating us as if we were a party of cooks tourists surely no said miss lavish her ardour visibly decreasing
the other carriage had drawn up behind and sensible mr beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly
leave them alone mr emerson begged the chaplain of whom he stood in no awe
do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there
to be driven by loversa king might envy us and if we part them its more like sacrilege than anything i know here the voice of miss bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect
mr
eager who suffered from an over fluent tongue rather than a resolute will was determined to make himself heard
he addressed the driver again
italian in the mouth of italians is a deep voiced stream with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony
in mr eagers mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher and quicker and quicker and more and more shrilly till abruptly it was turned off with a click
signorina said the man to lucy when the display had ceased
why should he appeal to lucy
signorina echoed persephone in her glorious contralto
she pointed at the other carriage
why
for a moment the two girls looked at each other
then persephone got down from the box
victory at last said mr
eager smiting his hands together as the carriages started again
it is not victory said mr emerson
it is defeat
you have parted two people who were happy mr
eager shut his eyes
he was obliged to sit next to mr emerson but he would not speak to him
the old man was refreshed by sleep and took up the matter warmly
he commanded lucy to agree with him he shouted for support to his son
we have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money
he has bargained to drive us and he is doing it
we have no rights over his soul miss lavish frowned
it is hard when a person you have classed as typically british speaks out of his character
he was not driving us well she said
he jolted us that i deny
it was as restful as sleeping
aha
he is jolting us now
can you wonder
he would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified
and if i were superstitious id be frightened of the girl too
it doesnt do to injure young people
have you ever heard of lorenzo de medici miss lavish bristled
most certainly i have
do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature the lord knows
possibly he does know for i refer to lorenzo the poet
he wrote a lineso i heard yesterdaywhich runs like this dont go fighting against the spring mr
eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition
non fate guerra al maggio he murmured
war not with the may would render a correct meaning the point is we have warred with it
look he pointed to the val darno which was visible far below them through the budding trees
fifty miles of spring and weve come up to admire them
do you suppose theres any difference between spring in nature and spring in man
but there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both no one encouraged him to talk
presently mr
eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill
a hollow like a great amphitheatre full of terraced steps and misty olives now lay between them and the heights of fiesole and the road still following its curve was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain
it was this promontory uncultivated wet covered with bushes and occasional trees which had caught the fancy of alessio baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before
he had ascended it that diligent and rather obscure master possibly with an eye to business possibly for the joy of ascending
standing there he had seen that view of the val darno and distant florence which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work
but where exactly had he stood
that was the question which mr
eager hoped to solve now
and miss lavish whose nature was attracted by anything problematical had become equally enthusiastic
but it is not easy to carry the pictures of alessio baldovinetti in your head even if you have remembered to look at them before starting
and the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest
the party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions
finally they split into groups
lucy clung to miss bartlett and miss lavish the emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers while the two clergymen who were expected to have topics in common were left to each other
the two elder ladies soon threw off the mask
in the audible whisper that was now so familiar to lucy they began to discuss not alessio baldovinetti but the drive
miss bartlett had asked mr george emerson what his profession was and he had answered the railway she was very sorry that she had asked him
she had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer or she would not have asked him
mr beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him
the railway gasped miss lavish
oh but i shall die
of course it was the railway she could not control her mirth
he is the image of a porteron on the south eastern eleanor be quiet plucking at her vivacious companion
hush
theyll hearthe emersons i cant stop
let me go my wicked way
a porter eleanor im sure its all right put in lucy
the emersons wont hear and they wouldnt mind if they did miss lavish did not seem pleased at this
miss honeychurch listening she said rather crossly
pouf
wouf
you naughty girl
go away oh lucy you ought to be with mr
eager im sure i cant find them now and i dont want to either mr
eager will be offended
it is your party please id rather stop here with you no i agree said miss lavish
its like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls
miss lucy you are to go
we wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear the girl was stubborn
as her time at florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent
such a one was miss lavish and such for the moment was charlotte
she wished she had not called attention to herself they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her
how tired one gets said miss bartlett
oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here unselfishness with miss bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm
lucy did not look at the view either
she would not enjoy anything till she was safe at rome
then sit you down said miss lavish
observe my foresight with many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps
she sat on one who was to sit on the other
lucy without a moments doubt lucy
the ground will do for me
really i have not had rheumatism for years
if i do feel it coming on i shall stand
imagine your mothers feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen she sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist
here we are all settled delightfully
even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown
sit down dear you are too unselfish you dont assert yourself enough she cleared her throat
now dont be alarmed this isnt a cold
its the tiniest cough and i have had it three days
its nothing to do with sitting here at all there was only one way of treating the situation
at the end of five minutes lucy departed in search of mr beebe and mr
eager vanquished by the mackintosh square
she addressed herself to the drivers who were sprawling in the carriages perfuming the cushions with cigars
the miscreant a bony young man scorched black by the sun rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative
dove said lucy after much anxious thought
his face lit up
of course he knew where
not so far either
his arm swept three fourths of the horizon
he should just think he did know where
he pressed his finger tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge
more seemed necessary
what was the italian for clergyman
dove buoni uomini said she at last
good
scarcely the adjective for those noble beings
he showed her his cigar
unopiupiccolo was her next remark implying has the cigar been given to you by mr beebe the smaller of the two good men she was correct as usual
he tied the horse to a tree kicked it to make it stay quiet dusted the carriage arranged his hair remoulded his hat encouraged his moustache and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her
italians are born knowing the way
it would seem that the whole earth lay before them not as a map but as a chess board whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares
any one can find places but the finding of people is a gift from god
he only stopped once to pick her some great blue violets
she thanked him with real pleasure
in the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct
for the first time she felt the influence of spring
his arm swept the horizon gracefully violets like other things existed in great profusion there would she like to see them ma buoni uomini he bowed
certainly
good men first violets afterwards
they proceeded briskly through the undergrowth which became thicker and thicker
they were nearing the edge of the promontory and the view was stealing round them but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces
he was occupied in his cigar and in holding back the pliant boughs
she was rejoicing in her escape from dullness
not a step not a twig was unimportant to her
what is that there was a voice in the wood in the distance behind them
the voice of mr
eager
he shrugged his shoulders
an italians ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge
she could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen
the view was forming at last she could discern the river the golden plain other hills
eccolo he exclaimed
at the same moment the ground gave way and with a cry she fell out of the wood
light and beauty enveloped her
she had fallen on to a little open terrace which was covered with violets from end to end
courage cried her companion now standing some six feet above
courage and love she did not answer
from her feet the ground sloped sharply into view and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts irrigating the hillside with blue eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows covering the grass with spots of azure foam
but never again were they in such profusion this terrace was the well head the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth
standing at its brink like a swimmer who prepares was the good man
but he was not the good man that she had expected and he was alone
george had turned at the sound of her arrival
for a moment he contemplated her as one who had fallen out of heaven
he saw radiant joy in her face he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves
the bushes above them closed
he stepped quickly forward and kissed her
before she could speak almost before she could feel a voice called lucy
lucy
lucy the silence of life had been broken by miss bartlett who stood brown against the view
chapter vii they return some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon
what it was and exactly how the players had sided lucy was slow to discover
mr
eager had met them with a questioning eye
charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk
mr emerson seeking his son was told whereabouts to find him
mr beebe who wore the heated aspect of a neutral was bidden to collect the factions for the return home
there was a general sense of groping and bewilderment
pan had been amongst themnot the great god pan who has been buried these two thousand years but the little god pan who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics
mr beebe had lost everyone and had consumed in solitude the tea basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise
miss lavish had lost miss bartlett
lucy had lost mr
eager
mr emerson had lost george
miss bartlett had lost a mackintosh square
phaethon had lost the game
that last fact was undeniable
he climbed on to the box shivering with his collar up prophesying the swift approach of bad weather
let us go immediately he told them
the signorino will walk all the way
he will be hours said mr beebe
apparently
i told him it was unwise he would look no one in the face perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him
he alone had played skilfully using the whole of his instinct while the others had used scraps of their intelligence
he alone had divined what things were and what he wished them to be
he alone had interpreted the message that lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man
persephone who spends half her life in the graveshe could interpret it also
not so these english
they gain knowledge slowly and perhaps too late
the thoughts of a cab driver however just seldom affect the lives of his employers
he was the most competent of miss bartletts opponents but infinitely the least dangerous
once back in the town he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble english ladies no more
of course it was most unpleasant she had seen his black head in the bushes he might make a tavern story out of it
but after all what have we to do with taverns
real menace belongs to the drawing room
it was of drawing room people that miss bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun
lucy sat beside her mr
eager sat opposite trying to catch her eye he was vaguely suspicious
they spoke of alessio baldovinetti
rain and darkness came on together
the two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol
there was a lightning flash and miss lavish who was nervous screamed from the carriage in front
at the next flash lucy screamed also
mr
eager addressed her professionally courage miss honeychurch courage and faith
if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements
are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me noof course even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous
the steel knives the only articles which might attract the current are in the other carriage
and in any case we are infinitely safer than if we were walking
couragecourage and faith under the rug lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousins hand
at times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards
miss bartlett by this timely exercise of her muscles gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination
she renewed it when the two carriages stopped half into florence
mr
eager called mr beebe
we want your assistance
will you interpret for us george cried mr emerson
ask your driver which way george went
the boy may lose his way
he may be killed go mr eager said miss bartlett dont ask our driver our driver is no help
go and support poor mr beebe he is nearly demented he may be killed cried the old man
he may be killed typical behaviour said the chaplain as he quitted the carriage
in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down what does he know whispered lucy as soon as they were alone
charlotte how much does mr
eager know nothing dearest he knows nothing
but she pointed at the driverhe knows everything
dearest had we better
shall i she took out her purse
it is dreadful to be entangled with low class people
he saw it all tapping phaethons back with her guide book she said silenzio and offered him a franc
va bene he replied and accepted it
as well this ending to his day as any
but lucy a mortal maid was disappointed in him
there was an explosion up the road
the storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline and one of the great supports had fallen
if they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt
they chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation and the floods of love and sincerity which fructify every hour of life burst forth in tumult
they descended from the carriages they embraced each other
it was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them
for a moment they realized vast possibilities of good
the older people recovered quickly
in the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike
miss lavish calculated that even if they had continued they would not have been caught in the accident
mr
eager mumbled a temperate prayer
but the drivers through miles of dark squalid road poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints and lucy poured out hers to her cousin
charlotte dear charlotte kiss me
kiss me again
only you can understand me
you warned me to be careful
and ii thought i was developing do not cry dearest
take your time i have been obstinate and sillyworse than you know far worse
once by the riveroh but he isnt killedhe wouldnt be killed would he the thought disturbed her repentance
as a matter of fact the storm was worst along the road but she had been near danger and so she thought it must be near to everyone
i trust not
one would always pray against that he is reallyi think he was taken by surprise just as i was before
but this time im not to blame i want you to believe that
i simply slipped into those violets
no i want to be really truthful
i am a little to blame
i had silly thoughts
the sky you know was gold and the ground all blue and for a moment he looked like someone in a book in a book heroesgodsthe nonsense of schoolgirls and then but charlotte you know what happened then miss bartlett was silent
indeed she had little more to learn
with a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her
all the way back lucys body was shaken by deep sighs which nothing could repress
i want to be truthful she whispered
it is so hard to be absolutely truthful dont be troubled dearest
wait till you are calmer
we will talk it over before bed time in my room so they re entered the city with hands clasped
it was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others
the storm had ceased and mr emerson was easier about his son
mr beebe had regained good humour and mr
eager was already snubbing miss lavish
charlotte alone she was sure ofcharlotte whose exterior concealed so much insight and love
the luxury of self exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening
she thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it
all her sensations her spasms of courage her moments of unreasonable joy her mysterious discontent should be carefully laid before her cousin
and together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all
at last thought she i shall understand myself
i shant again be troubled by things that come out of nothing and mean i dont know what miss alan asked her to play
she refused vehemently
music seemed to her the employment of a child
she sat close to her cousin who with commendable patience was listening to a long story about lost luggage
when it was over she capped it by a story of her own
lucy became rather hysterical with the delay
in vain she tried to check or at all events to accelerate the tale
it was not till a late hour that miss bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach well dear i at all events am ready for bedfordshire
come into my room and i will give a good brush to your hair with some solemnity the door was shut and a cane chair placed for the girl
then miss bartlett said so what is to be done she was unprepared for the question
it had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything
a detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon
what is to be done
a point dearest which you alone can settle the rain was streaming down the black windows and the great room felt damp and chilly one candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to miss bartletts toque which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door
a tram roared by in the dark and lucy felt unaccountably sad though she had long since dried her eyes
she lifted them to the ceiling where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague the very ghosts of joy
it has been raining for nearly four hours she said at last
miss bartlett ignored the remark
how do you propose to silence him the driver my dear girl no mr george emerson lucy began to pace up and down the room
i dont understand she said at last
she understood very well but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful
how are you going to stop him talking about it i have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do i too intend to judge him charitably
but unfortunately i have met the type before
they seldom keep their exploits to themselves exploits cried lucy wincing under the horrible plural
my poor dear did you suppose that this was his first
come here and listen to me
i am only gathering it from his own remarks
do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with miss alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another yes said lucy whom at the time the argument had pleased
well i am no prude
there is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined
let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish
but we are no farther on with our question
what do you propose to do an idea rushed across lucys brain which had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her might have proved victorious
i propose to speak to him said she
miss bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm
you see charlotte your kindnessi shall never forget it
butas you saidit is my affair
mine and his and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence certainly not
there would be no difficulty
whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over
i have been frightened of him
but now i am not one little bit but we fear him for you dear
you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can behow they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round
this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened i cant think said lucy gravely
something in her voice made miss bartlett repeat her question intoning it more vigorously
what would have happened if i hadnt arrived i cant think said lucy again
when he insulted you how would you have replied i hadnt time to think
you came yes but wont you tell me now what you would have done i should have she checked herself and broke the sentence off
she went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness
she could not think what she would have done
come away from the window dear said miss bartlett
you will be seen from the road lucy obeyed
she was in her cousins power
she could not modulate out the key of self abasement in which she had started
neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to george and settle the matter whatever it was with him
miss bartlett became plaintive
oh for a real man
we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless
there is mr
eager but you do not trust him
oh for your brother
he is young but i know that his sisters insult would rouse in him a very lion
thank god chivalry is not yet dead
there are still left some men who can reverence woman as she spoke she pulled off her rings of which she wore several and ranged them upon the pin cushion
then she blew into her gloves and said it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try what train the train to rome she looked at her gloves critically
the girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given
when does the train to rome go at eight signora bertolini would be upset we must face that said miss bartlett not liking to say that she had given notice already
she will make us pay for a whole weeks pension i expect she will
however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel
isnt afternoon tea given there for nothing yes but they pay extra for wine after this remark she remained motionless and silent
to her tired eyes charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream
they began to sort their clothes for packing for there was no time to lose if they were to catch the train to rome
lucy when admonished began to move to and fro between the rooms more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill charlotte who was practical without ability knelt by the side of an empty trunk vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size
she gave two or three sighs for the stooping posture hurt her back and for all her diplomacy she felt that she was growing old
the girl heard her as she entered the room and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause
she only felt that the candle would burn better the packing go easier the world be happier if she could give and receive some human love
the impulse had come before to day but never so strongly
she knelt down by her cousins side and took her in her arms
miss bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth
but she was not a stupid woman and she knew perfectly well that lucy did not love her but needed her to love
for it was in ominous tones that she said after a long pause dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me lucy was on her guard at once knowing by bitter experience what forgiving miss bartlett meant
her emotion relaxed she modified her embrace a little and she said charlotte dear what do you mean
as if i have anything to forgive you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too
i know well how much i vex you at every turn but no miss bartlett assumed her favourite role that of the prematurely aged martyr
ah but yes
i feel that our tour together is hardly the success i had hoped
i might have known it would not do
you want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you
i am too uninteresting and old fashionedonly fit to pack and unpack your things please my only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home
i had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but i hope i did not inflict them on you more than was necessary
you had your own way about these rooms at all events you mustnt say these things said lucy softly
she still clung to the hope that she and charlotte loved each other heart and soul
they continued to pack in silence
i have been a failure said miss bartlett as she struggled with the straps of lucys trunk instead of strapping her own
failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother
she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster but mother will understand
it is not your fault this trouble and it isnt a disaster either it is my fault it is a disaster
she will never forgive me and rightly
for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish every right when i was here for your sake
if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you
your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her lucy from a cowardly wish to improve the situation said why need mother hear of it but you tell her everything i suppose i do generally i dare not break your confidence
there is something sacred in it
unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her the girl would not be degraded to this
naturally i should have told her
but in case she should blame you in any way i promise i will not i am very willing not to
i will never speak of it either to her or to any one her promise brought the long drawn interview to a sudden close
miss bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks wished her good night and sent her to her own room
for a moment the original trouble was in the background
george would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually
at present she neither acquitted nor condemned him she did not pass judgement
at the moment when she was about to judge him her cousins voice had intervened and ever since it was miss bartlett who had dominated miss bartlett who even now could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall miss bartlett who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent
she had worked like a great artist for a timeindeed for yearsshe had been meaningless but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn bettera shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil but which do not seem to bring good if we may judge from those who have used them most
lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity of her craving for sympathy and love
such a wrong is not easily forgotten
never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff
and such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul
the door bell rang and she started to the shutters
before she reached them she hesitated turned and blew out the candle
thus it was that though she saw someone standing in the wet below he though he looked up did not see her
to reach his room he had to go by hers
she was still dressed
it struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up and that their extraordinary intercourse was over
whether she would have dared to do this was never proved
at the critical moment miss bartlett opened her own door and her voice said i wish one word with you in the drawing room mr emerson please soon their footsteps returned and miss bartlett said good night mr emerson his heavy tired breathing was the only reply the chaperon had done her work
lucy cried aloud it isnt true
it cant all be true
i want not to be muddled
i want to grow older quickly miss bartlett tapped on the wall
go to bed at once dear
you need all the rest you can get in the morning they left for rome
part two chapter viii medieval the drawing room curtains at windy corner had been pulled to meet for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the august sun
they were heavy curtains reaching almost to the ground and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied
a poetnone was presentmight have quoted life like a dome of many coloured glass or might have compared the curtains to sluice gates lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven
without was poured a sea of radiance within the glory though visible was tempered to the capacities of man
two pleasant people sat in the room
onea boy of nineteenwas studying a small manual of anatomy and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano
from time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned for the day was hot and the print small and the human frame fearfully made and his mother who was writing a letter did continually read out to him what she had written
and continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet and make the remark that they were still there
where arent they said the boy who was freddy lucys brother
i tell you im getting fairly sick for goodness sake go out of my drawing room then cried mrs honeychurch who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally
freddy did not move or reply
i think things are coming to a head she observed rather wanting her sons opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication
time they did i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more its his third go isnt it freddy i do call the way you talk unkind i didnt mean to be unkind then he added but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy
i dont know how girls manage things but she cant have said no properly before or she wouldnt have to say it again now
over the whole thingi cant explaini do feel so uncomfortable do you indeed dear
how interesting i feelnever mind he returned to his work
just listen to what i have written to mrs vyse
i said dear mrs vyse yes mother you told me
a jolly good letter i said dear mrs vyse cecil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it
but she stopped reading i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all
he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth
when it comes to the point he cant get on without me nor me you freddy nodded
what do you mean he asked me for my permission also she exclaimed how very odd of him why so asked the son and heir
why shouldnt my permission be asked what do you know about lucy or girls or anything
what ever did you say i said to cecil take her or leave her its no business of mine what a helpful answer but her own answer though more normal in its wording had been to the same effect
the bother is this began freddy
then he took up his work again too shy to say what the bother was
mrs honeychurch went back to the window
freddy you must come
there they still are i dont see you ought to go peeping like that peeping like that
cant i look out of my own window but she returned to the writing table observing as she passed her son still page freddy snorted and turned over two leaves
for a brief space they were silent
close by beyond the curtains the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased
the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully he gave a nervous gulp
not content with permission which i did givethat is to say i said i dont mindwell not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasnt off my head with joy
he practically put it like this wasnt it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her
and he would have an answerhe said it would strengthen his hand i hope you gave a careful answer dear i answered no said the boy grinding his teeth
there
fly into a stew
i cant help ithad to say it
i had to say no
he ought never to have asked me ridiculous child cried his mother
you think youre so holy and truthful but really its only abominable conceit
do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say
i hope he boxed your ears
how dare you say no oh do keep quiet mother
i had to say no when i couldnt say yes
i tried to laugh as if i didnt mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right
but i feel my foots in it
oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work no said mrs honeychurch with the air of one who has considered the subject i shall not keep quiet
you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house not a bit he pleaded
i only let out i didnt like him
i dont hate him but i dont like him
what i mind is that hell tell lucy he glanced at the curtains dismally
well i like him said mrs honeychurch
i know his mother hes good hes clever hes rich hes well connectedoh you neednt kick the piano
hes well connectedill say it again if you like hes well connected she paused as if rehearsing her eulogy but her face remained dissatisfied
she added and he has beautiful manners i liked him till just now
i suppose its having him spoiling lucys first week at home and its also something that mr beebe said not knowing mr
beebe said his mother trying to conceal her interest
i dont see how mr beebe comes in you know mr beebes funny way when you never quite know what he means
he said mr
vyse is an ideal bachelor i was very cute i asked him what he meant
he said oh hes like mebetter detached i couldnt make him say any more but it set me thinking
since cecil has come after lucy he hasnt been so pleasant at leasti cant explain you never can dear
but i can
you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties the explanation seemed plausible and freddy tried to accept it
but at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust
cecil praised one too much for being athletic
was that it
cecil made one talk in ones own way
this tired one
was that it
and cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellows cap
unaware of his own profundity freddy checked himself
he must be jealous or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons
will this do called his mother
dear mrs vysececil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it then i put in at the top and i have told lucy so i must write the letter out againand i have told lucy so
but lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves i said that because i didnt want mrs vyse to think us old fashioned
she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maids dirty thumb marks where you turn on the electric light
she keeps that flat abominably suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country dont interrupt so foolishly
where was i
oh yesyoung people must decide for themselves
i know that lucy likes your son because she tells me everything and she wrote to me from rome when he asked her first no ill cross that last bit outit looks patronizing
ill stop at because she tells me everything or shall i cross that out too cross it out too said freddy
mrs honeychurch left it in
then the whole thing runs dear mrs vysececil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it and i have told lucy so
but lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves
i know that lucy likes your son because she tells me everything
but i do not know look out cried freddy
the curtains parted
cecils first movement was one of irritation
he couldnt bear the honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture
instinctively he give the curtains a twitch and sent them swinging down their poles
light entered
there was revealed a terrace such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it and on it a little rustic seat and two flower beds
but it was transfigured by the view beyond for windy corner was built on the range that overlooks the sussex weald
lucy who was in the little seat seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world
cecil entered
appearing thus late in the story cecil must be at once described
he was medieval
like a gothic statue
tall and refined with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a french cathedral
well educated well endowed and not deficient physically he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self consciousness and whom the medieval with dimmer vision worshipped as asceticism
a gothic statue implies celibacy just as a greek statue implies fruition and perhaps this was what mr beebe meant
and freddy who ignored history and art perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine cecil wearing another fellows cap
mrs honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance
oh cecil she exclaimedoh cecil do tell me i promessi sposi said he
they stared at him anxiously
she has accepted me he said and the sound of the thing in english made him flush and smile with pleasure and look more human
i am so glad said mrs honeychurch while freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals
they wished that they also knew italian for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones
we are obliged to become vaguely poetic or to take refuge in scriptural reminiscences
welcome as one of the family said mrs honeychurch waving her hand at the furniture
this is indeed a joyous day
i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy i hope so replied the young man shifting his eyes to the ceiling
we mothers simpered mrs honeychurch and then realized that she was affected sentimental bombasticall the things she hated most
why could she not be freddy who stood stiff in the middle of the room looking very cross and almost handsome
i say lucy called cecil for conversation seemed to flag
lucy rose from the seat
she moved across the lawn and smiled in at them just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis
then she saw her brothers face
her lips parted and she took him in her arms
he said steady on not a kiss for me asked her mother
lucy kissed her also
would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it cecil suggested
and id stop here and tell my mother we go with lucy said freddy as if taking orders
yes you go with lucy they passed into the sunlight
cecil watched them cross the terrace and descend out of sight by the steps
they would descendhe knew their wayspast the shrubbery and past the tennis lawn and the dahlia bed until they reached the kitchen garden and there in the presence of the potatoes and the peas the great event would be discussed
smiling indulgently he lit a cigarette and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion
he had known lucy for several years but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical
he could still remember his depression that afternoon at rome when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue and demanded to be taken to st peters
that day she had seemed a typical touristshrill crude and gaunt with travel
but italy worked some marvel in her
it gave her light andwhich he held more preciousit gave her shadow
soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence
she was like a woman of leonardo da vincis whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us
the things are assuredly not of this life no woman of leonardos could have anything so vulgar as a story she did develop most wonderfully day by day
so it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion at least to a profound uneasiness
already at rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other
it had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion
her refusal had been clear and gentle after itas the horrid phrase wentshe had been exactly the same to him as before
three months later on the margin of italy among the flower clad alps he had asked her again in bald traditional language
she reminded him of a leonardo more than ever her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her
he walked home with her unashamed feeling not at all like a rejected suitor
the things that really mattered were unshaken
so now he had asked her once more and clear and gentle as ever she had accepted him giving no coy reasons for her delay but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy
his mother too would be pleased she had counselled the step he must write her a long account
glancing at his hand in case any of freddys chemicals had come off on it he moved to the writing table
there he saw dear mrs vyse followed by many erasures
he recoiled without reading any more and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere and pencilled a note on his knee
then he lit another cigarette which did not seem quite as divine as the first and considered what might be done to make windy corner drawing room more distinctive
with that outlook it should have been a successful room but the trail of tottenham court road was upon it he could almost visualize the motor vans of messrs shoolbred and messrs
maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair those varnished book cases that writing table
the table recalled mrs honeychurchs letter
he did not want to read that letterhis temptations never lay in that direction but he worried about it none the less
it was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win lucy he wanted to feel that others no matter who they were agreed with him and so he had asked their permission
mrs honeychurch had been civil but obtuse in essentials while as for freddyhe is only a boy he reflected
i represent all that he despises
why should he want me for a brother in law the honeychurches were a worthy family but he began to realize that lucy was of another clay and perhapshe did not put it very definitelyhe ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible
mr
beebe said the maid and the new rector of summer street was shown in he had at once started on friendly relations owing to lucys praise of him in her letters from florence
cecil greeted him rather critically
ive come for tea mr vyse
do you suppose that i shall get it i should say so
food is the thing one does get heredont sit in that chair young honeychurch has left a bone in it pfui i know said cecil
i know
i cant think why mrs honeychurch allows it for cecil considered the bone and the maples furniture separately he did not realize that taken together they kindled the room into the life that he desired
ive come for tea and for gossip
isnt this news news
i dont understand you said cecil
news mr beebe whose news was of a very different nature prattled forward
i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field
he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack has he indeed said cecil trying to recover himself
into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen
was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant
but his stiffness remained and though he asked who cissie and albert might be he still thought mr beebe rather a bounder
unpardonable question
to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semi detached villas that have been run up opposite the church
ill set mrs honeychurch after you im shockingly stupid over local affairs said the young man languidly
i cant even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board
perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those arent the right names
i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery
it is very remiss of me
italy and london are the only places where i dont feel to exist on sufferance mr beebe distressed at this heavy reception of cissie and albert determined to shift the subject
let me see mr vysei forgetwhat is your profession i have no profession said cecil
it is another example of my decadence
my attitudequite an indefensible oneis that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like
i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i dont care a straw about but somehow ive not been able to begin you are very fortunate said mr beebe
it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure his voice was rather parochial but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally
he felt as all who have regular occupation must feel that others should have it also
i am glad that you approve
i darent face the healthy personfor example freddy honeychurch oh freddys a good sort isnt he admirable
the sort who has made england what she is cecil wondered at himself
why on this day of all others was he so hopelessly contrary
he tried to get right by inquiring effusively after mr beebes mother an old lady for whom he had no particular regard
then he flattered the clergyman praised his liberal mindedness his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science
where are the others said mr beebe at last i insist on extracting tea before evening service i suppose anne never told them you were here
in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives
the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chair legs with her feet
the faults of maryi forget the faults of mary but they are very grave
shall we look in the garden i know the faults of mary
she leaves the dust pans standing on the stairs the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small they both laughed and things began to go better
the faults of freddy cecil continued
ah he has too many
no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy
try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable she has none said the young man with grave sincerity
i quite agree
at present she has none at present im not cynical
im only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch
does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly
i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both
the water tight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle
then we shall have her heroically good heroically badtoo heroic perhaps to be good or bad cecil found his companion interesting
and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes well i must say ive only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence
since i came to summer street she has been away
you saw her didnt you at rome and in the alps
oh i forgot of course you knew her before
no she wasnt wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be in what way conversation had become agreeable to them and they were pacing up and down the terrace
i could as easily tell you what tune shell play next
there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them
i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string
picture number two the string breaks the sketch was in his diary but it had been made afterwards when he viewed things artistically
at the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself
but the string never broke no
i mightnt have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall it has broken now said the young man in low vibrating tones
immediately he realized that of all the conceited ludicrous contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst
he cursed his love of metaphor had he suggested that he was a star and that lucy was soaring up to reach him
broken
what do you mean i meant said cecil stiffly that she is going to marry me the clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice
i am sorry i must apologize
i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way
mr vyse you ought to have stopped me and down the garden he saw lucy herself yes he was disappointed
cecil who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies drew down his mouth at the corners
was this the reception his action would get from the world
of course he despised the world as a whole every thoughtful man should it is almost a test of refinement
but he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered
occasionally he could be quite crude
i am sorry i have given you a shock he said dryly
i fear that lucys choice does not meet with your approval not that
but you ought to have stopped me
i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes
perhaps i oughtnt to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you you are conscious of having said something indiscreet mr beebe pulled himself together
really mr vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions
he was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession
no i have said nothing indiscreet
i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended
i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step
she has taken it
she has learntyou will let me talk freely as i have begun freelyshe has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides it was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio
he did not omit to do so
she has learnt through you and if his voice was still clerical it was now also sincere let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her grazie tante said cecil who did not like parsons
have you heard shouted mrs honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden
oh mr beebe have you heard the news freddy now full of geniality whistled the wedding march
youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact
indeed i have he cried
he looked at lucy
in her presence he could not act the parson any longerat all events not without apology
mrs
honeychurch im going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally im too shy
i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small
i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother
and now i want my tea you only asked for it just in time the lady retorted
how dare you be serious at windy corner he took his tone from her
there was no more heavy beneficence no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the scriptures
none of them dared or was able to be serious any more
an engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe
away from it in the solitude of their rooms mr beebe and even freddy might again be critical
but in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious
it has a strange power for it compels not only the lips but the very heart
the chief parallel to compare one great thing with anotheris the power over us of a temple of some alien creed
standing outside we deride or oppose it or at the most feel sentimental
inside though the saints and gods are not ours we become true believers in case any true believer should be present
so it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea party
if they were hypocrites they did not know it and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true
anne putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present stimulated them greatly
they could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing room door
mr beebe chirruped
freddy was at his wittiest referring to cecil as the fiascofamily honoured pun on fiance
mrs honeychurch amusing and portly promised well as a mother in law
as for lucy and cecil for whom the temple had been built they also joined in the merry ritual but waited as earnest worshippers should for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy
chapter ix lucy as a work of art a few days after the engagement was announced mrs honeychurch made lucy and her fiasco come to a little garden party in the neighbourhood for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man
cecil was more than presentable he looked distinguished and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with lucy and his long fair face responding when lucy spoke to him
people congratulated mrs honeychurch which is i believe a social blunder but it pleased her and she introduced cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers
at tea a misfortune took place a cup of coffee was upset over lucys figured silk and though lucy feigned indifference her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid
they were gone some time and cecil was left with the dowagers
when they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been
do you go to much of this sort of thing he asked when they were driving home
oh now and then said lucy who had rather enjoyed herself
is it typical of country society i suppose so
mother would it be plenty of society said mrs honeychurch who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses
seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere cecil bent towards lucy and said to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous i am so sorry that you were stranded not that but the congratulations
it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public propertya kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment
all those old women smirking one has to go through it i suppose
they wont notice us so much next time but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong
an engagementhorrid word in the first placeis a private matter and should be treated as such yet the smirking old women however wrong individually were racially correct
the spirit of the generations had smiled through them rejoicing in the engagement of cecil and lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth
to cecil and lucy it promised something quite differentpersonal love
hence cecils irritation and lucys belief that his irritation was just
how tiresome she said
couldnt you have escaped to tennis i dont play tennisat least not in public
the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic
such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato inglese italianato e un diavolo incarnato
you know the proverb she did not
nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in rome with his mother
but cecil since his engagement had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing
well said he i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me
there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them we all have our limitations i suppose said wise lucy
sometimes they are forced on us though said cecil who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position
how it makes a difference doesnt it whether we fully fence ourselves in or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others she thought a moment and agreed that it did make a difference
difference cried mrs honeychurch suddenly alert
i dont see any difference
fences are fences especially when they are in the same place we were speaking of motives said cecil on whom the interruption jarred
my dear cecil look here she spread out her knees and perched her card case on her lap
this is me
thats windy corner
the rest of the pattern is the other people
motives are all very well but the fence comes here we werent talking of real fences said lucy laughing
oh i see dearpoetry she leant placidly back
cecil wondered why lucy had been amused
i tell you who has no fences as you call them she said and thats mr beebe a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless lucy was slow to follow what people said but quick enough to detect what they meant
she missed cecils epigram but grasped the feeling that prompted it
dont you like mr beebe she asked thoughtfully
i never said so he cried
i consider him far above the average
i only denied and he swept off on the subject of fences again and was brilliant
now a clergyman that i do hate said she wanting to say something sympathetic a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr
eager the english chaplain at florence
he was truly insincerenot merely the manner unfortunate
he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things what sort of things there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife perhaps he had no why no he was such a nice old man im sure cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence
well i did try to sift the thing
mr
eager would never come to the point
he prefers it vaguesaid the old man had practically murdered his wifehad murdered her in the sight of god hush dear said mrs honeychurch absently
but isnt it intolerable that a person whom were told to imitate should go round spreading slander
it was i believe chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped
people pretended he was vulgar but he certainly wasnt that poor old man
what was his name harris said lucy glibly
lets hope that mrs harris there warnt no sich person said her mother
cecil nodded intelligently
isnt mr
eager a parson of the cultured type he asked
i dont know
i hate him
ive heard him lecture on giotto
i hate him
nothing can hide a petty nature
i hate him my goodness gracious me child said mrs honeychurch
youll blow my head off
whatever is there to shout over
i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen he smiled
there was indeed something rather incongruous in lucys moral outburst over mr
eager
it was as if one should see the leonardo on the ceiling of the sistine
he longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation that a womans power and charm reside in mystery not in muscular rant
but possibly rant is a sign of vitality it mars the beautiful creature but shows that she is alive
after a moment he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval
he forebore to repress the sources of youth
naturesimplest of topics he thoughtlay around them
he praised the pine woods the deep lasts of bracken the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt bushes the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road
the outdoor world was not very familiar to him and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact
mrs honeychurchs mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch
i count myself a lucky person he concluded when im in london i feel i could never live out of it
when im in the country i feel the same about the country
after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best
its true that in nine cases out of ten they dont seem to notice anything
the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions
yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town
do you feel that mrs honeychurch mrs honeychurch started and smiled
she had not been attending
cecil who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria felt irritable and determined not to say anything interesting again
lucy had not attended either
her brow was wrinkled and she still looked furiously crossthe result he concluded of too much moral gymnastics
it was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an august wood
come down o maid from yonder mountain height he quoted and touched her knee with his own
she flushed again and said what height come down o maid from yonder mountain height what pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang
in height and in the splendour of the hills let us take mrs honeychurchs advice and hate clergymen no more
whats this place summer street of course said lucy and roused herself
the woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow
pretty cottages lined it on two sides and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church expensively simple a charming shingled spire
mr beebes house was near the church
in height it scarcely exceeded the cottages
some great mansions were at hand but they were hidden in the trees
the scene suggested a swiss alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world and was marred only by two ugly little villasthe villas that had competed with cecils engagement having been acquired by sir harry otway the very afternoon that lucy had been acquired by cecil
cissie was the name of one of these villas albert of the other
these titles were not only picked out in shaded gothic on the garden gates but appeared a second time on the porches where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals
albert was inhabited
his tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells
his little windows were chastely swathed in nottingham lace
cissie was to let
three notice boards belonging to dorking agents lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact
her paths were already weedy her pocket handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions
the place is ruined said the ladies mechanically
summer street will never be the same again as the carriage passed cissies door opened and a gentleman came out of her
stop cried mrs honeychurch touching the coachman with her parasol
heres sir harry
now we shall know
sir harry pull those things down at once sir harry otwaywho need not be describedcame to the carriage and said mrs
honeychurch i meant to
i cant i really cant turn out miss flack am i not always right
she ought to have gone before the contract was signed
does she still live rent free as she did in her nephews time but what can i do he lowered his voice
an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden turn her out said cecil bravely
sir harry sighed and looked at the villas mournfully
he had had full warning of mr flacks intentions and might have bought the plot before building commenced but he was apathetic and dilatory
he had known summer street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt
not till mrs flack had laid the foundation stone and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm
he called on mr flack the local buildera most reasonable and respectful manwho agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof but pointed out that slates were cheaper
he ventured to differ however about the corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows saying that for his part he liked to relieve the faade by a bit of decoration
sir harry hinted that a column if possible should be structural as well as decorative
mr flack replied that all the columns had been ordered adding and all the capitals differentone with dragons in the foliage another approaching to the ionian style another introducing mrs flacks initialsevery one different for he had read his ruskin
he built his villas according to his desire and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did sir harry buy
this futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on mrs honeychurchs carriage
he had failed in his duties to the country side and the country side was laughing at him as well
he had spent money and yet summer street was spoilt as much as ever
all he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for cissiesomeone really desirable
the rent is absurdly low he told them and perhaps i am an easy landlord
but it is such an awkward size
it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise sir harry for despising them
the latter impulse seemed the more fruitful
you ought to find a tenant at once he said maliciously
it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk exactly said sir harry excitedly
that is exactly what i fear mr vyse
it will attract the wrong type of people
the train service has improveda fatal improvement to my mind
and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles rather a strenuous clerk it would be said lucy
cecil who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate
she saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour and roused herself to stop him
sir harry she exclaimed i have an idea
how would you like spinsters my dear lucy it would be splendid
do you know any such yes i met them abroad gentlewomen he asked tentatively
yes indeed and at the present moment homeless
i heard from them last weekmiss teresa and miss catharine alan
im really not joking
they are quite the right people
mr beebe knows them too
may i tell them to write to you indeed you may he cried
here we are with the difficulty solved already
how delightful it is
extra facilitiesplease tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees
oh the agents
the appalling people they have sent me
one woman when i wrotea tactful letter you knowasking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance
as if one cares about that
and several references i took up were most unsatisfactorypeople swindlers or not respectable
and oh the deceit
i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week
the deceit of the most promising people
my dear lucy the deceit she nodded
my advice put in mrs honeychurch is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all
i know the type
preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy
its a sad thing but id far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down i think i follow you said sir harry but it is as you say a very sad thing the misses alan arent that cried lucy
yes they are said cecil
i havent met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood dont listen to him sir harryhes tiresome its i who am tiresome he replied
i oughtnt to come with my troubles to young people
but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help then may i write to my misses alan please but his eye wavered when mrs honeychurch exclaimed beware
they are certain to have canaries
sir harry beware of canaries they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come
beware of women altogether
only let to a man really he murmured gallantly though he saw the wisdom of her remark
men dont gossip over tea cups
if they get drunk theres an end of themthey lie down comfortably and sleep it off
if theyre vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves
it doesnt spread so
give me a manof course provided hes clean sir harry blushed
neither he nor cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex
even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction
he suggested that mrs honeychurch if she had time should descend from the carriage and inspect cissie for herself
she was delighted
nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house
domestic arrangements always attracted her especially when they were on a small scale
cecil pulled lucy back as she followed her mother
mrs
honeychurch he said what if we two walk home and leave you certainly was her cordial reply
sir harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them
he beamed at them knowingly said aha
young people young people and then hastened to unlock the house
hopeless vulgarian exclaimed cecil almost before they were out of earshot
oh cecil i cant help it
it would be wrong not to loathe that man he isnt clever but really he is nice no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life
in london he would keep his place
he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties
but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and every oneeven your motheris taken in all that you say is quite true said lucy though she felt discouraged
i wonder whetherwhether it matters so very much it matters supremely
sir harry is the essence of that garden party
oh goodness how cross i feel
how i do hope hell get some vulgar tenant in that villasome woman so really vulgar that hell notice it
gentlefolks ugh
with his bald head and retreating chin
but lets forget him this lucy was glad enough to do
if cecil disliked sir harry otway and mr beebe what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape
for instance freddy
freddy was neither clever nor subtle nor beautiful and what prevented cecil from saying any minute it would be wrong not to loathe freddy
and what would she reply
further than freddy she did not go but he gave her anxiety enough
she could only assure herself that cecil had known freddy some time and that they had always got on pleasantly except perhaps during the last few days which was an accident perhaps
which way shall we go she asked him
naturesimplest of topics she thoughtwas around them
summer street lay deep in the woods and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad
are there two ways perhaps the road is more sensible as were got up smart id rather go through the wood said cecil with that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon
why is it lucy that you always say the road
do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged havent i
the wood then said lucy startled at his queerness but pretty sure that he would explain later it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning
she led the way into the whispering pines and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards
i had got an ideai dare say wronglythat you feel more at home with me in a room a room she echoed hopelessly bewildered
yes
or at the most in a garden or on a road
never in the real country like this oh cecil whatever do you mean
i have never felt anything of the sort
you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person i dont know that you arent
i connect you with a viewa certain type of view
why shouldnt you connect me with a room she reflected a moment and then said laughing do you know that youre right
i do
i must be a poetess after all
when i think of you its always as in a room
how funny to her surprise he seemed annoyed
a drawing room pray
with no view yes with no view i fancy
why not id rather he said reproachfully that you connected me with the open air she said again oh cecil whatever do you mean as no explanation was forthcoming she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl and led him further into the wood pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees
she had known the wood between summer street and windy corner ever since she could walk alone she had played at losing freddy in it when freddy was a purple faced baby and though she had been to italy it had lost none of its charm
presently they came to a little clearing among the pinesanother tiny green alp solitary this time and holding in its bosom a shallow pool
she exclaimed the sacred lake why do you call it that i cant remember why
i suppose it comes out of some book
its only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it
well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and cant get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful
then freddy used to bathe there
he is very fond of it and you he meant are you fond of it but she answered dreamily i bathed here too till i was found out
then there was a row at another time he might have been shocked for he had depths of prudishness within him
but now
with his momentary cult of the fresh air he was delighted at her admirable simplicity
he looked at her as she stood by the pools edge
she was got up smart as she phrased it and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own but blooms abruptly out of a world of green
who found you out charlotte she murmured
she was stopping with us
charlottecharlotte poor girl she smiled gravely
a certain scheme from which hitherto he had shrunk now appeared practical
lucy yes i suppose we ought to be going was her reply
lucy i want to ask something of you that i have never asked before at the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him
what cecil hitherto nevernot even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me he became self conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed
his courage had gone
yes up to now i have never kissed you she was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately
nomore you have she stammered
then i ask youmay i now of course you may cecil
you might before
i cant run at you you know at that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities
her reply was inadequate
she gave such a business like lift to her veil
as he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil
as he touched her his gold pince nez became dislodged and was flattened between them
such was the embrace
he considered with truth that it had been a failure
passion should believe itself irresistible
it should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature
above all it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way
why could he not do as any labourer or navvynay as any young man behind the counter would have done
he recast the scene
lucy was standing flowerlike by the water he rushed up and took her in his arms she rebuked him permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness
for he believed that women revere men for their manliness
they left the pool in silence after this one salutation
he waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts
at last she spoke and with fitting gravity
emerson was the name not harris what name the old mans what old man that old man i told you about
the one mr
eager was so unkind to he could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had
chapter x cecil as a humourist the society out of which cecil proposed to rescue lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to
her father a prosperous local solicitor had built windy corner as a speculation at the time the district was opening up and falling in love with his own creation had ended by living there himself
soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter
other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others again among the pine trees behind and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs
most of these houses were larger than windy corner and were filled by people who came not from the district but from london and who mistook the honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy
he was inclined to be frightened but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility
i cannot think what people are doing she would say but it is extremely fortunate for the children she called everywhere her calls were returned with enthusiasm and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their milieu they liked her and it did not seem to matter
when mr honeychurch died he had the satisfactionwhich few honest solicitors despiseof leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable
the best obtainable
certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull and lucy realized this more vividly since her return from italy
hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioningtheir kindly affluence their inexplosive religion their dislike of paper bags orange peel and broken bottles
a radical out and out she learnt to speak with horror of suburbia
life so far as she troubled to conceive it was a circle of rich pleasant people with identical interests and identical foes
in this circle one thought married and died
outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter just as the london fog tries to enter the pine woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills
but in italy where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality as in the sun this conception of life vanished
her senses expanded she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like that social barriers were irremovable doubtless but not particularly high
you jump over them just as you jump into a peasants olive yard in the apennines and he is glad to see you
she returned with new eyes
so did cecil but italy had quickened cecil not to tolerance but to irritation
he saw that the local society was narrow but instead of saying does that very much matter he rebelled and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad
he did not realize that lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time and that though her eyes saw its defects her heart refused to despise it entirely
nor did he realize a more important pointthat if she was too great for this society she was too great for all society and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her
a rebel she was but not of the kind he understooda rebel who desired not a wider dwelling room but equality beside the man she loved
for italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessionsher own soul
playing bumble puppy with minnie beebe niece to the rector and aged thirteenan ancient and most honourable game which consists in striking tennis balls high into the air so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce some hit mrs honeychurch others are lost
the sentence is confused but the better illustrates lucys state of mind for she was trying to talk to mr beebe at the same time
oh it has been such a nuisancefirst he then theyno one knowing what they wanted and everyone so tiresome but they really are coming now said mr beebe
i wrote to miss teresa a few days agoshe was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably
they are coming
i heard from them this morning
i shall hate those miss alans mrs honeychurch cried
just because theyre old and silly ones expected to say how sweet i hate their if ing and but ing and and ing
and poor lucyserve her rightworn to a shadow mr beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis court
cecil was absentone did not play bumble puppy when he was there
well if they are comingno minnie not saturn saturn was a tennis ball whose skin was partially unsewn
when in motion his orb was encircled by a ring
if they are coming sir harry will let them move in before the twenty ninth and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings because it made them nervous and put in the fair wear and tear onethat doesnt count
i told you not saturn saturns all right for bumble puppy cried freddy joining them
minnie dont you listen to her saturn doesnt bounce saturn bounces enough no he doesnt well he bounces better than the beautiful white devil hush dear said mrs honeychurch
but look at lucycomplaining of saturn and all the times got the beautiful white devil in her hand ready to plug it in
thats right minnie go for herget her over the shins with the racquetget her over the shins lucy fell the beautiful white devil rolled from her hand
mr beebe picked it up and said the name of this ball is vittoria corombona please but his correction passed unheeded
freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury and in half a minute he had transformed minnie from a well mannered child into a howling wilderness
up in the house cecil heard them and though he was full of entertaining news he did not come down to impart it in case he got hurt
he was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man
but he hated the physical violence of the young
how right it was
sure enough it ended in a cry
i wish the miss alans could see this observed mr beebe just as lucy who was nursing the injured minnie was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother
who are the miss alans freddy panted
they have taken cissie villa that wasnt the name here his foot slipped and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass
an interval elapses
wasnt what name asked lucy with her brothers head in her lap
alan wasnt the name of the people sir harrys let to nonsense freddy
you know nothing about it nonsense yourself
ive this minute seen him
he said to me ahem
honeychurchfreddy was an indifferent mimicahem
ahem
i have at last procured really dee sire rebel tenants i said ooray old boy and slapped him on the back exactly
the miss alans rather not
more like anderson oh good gracious there isnt going to be another muddle mrs honeychurch exclaimed
do you notice lucy im always right
i said dont interfere with cissie villa
im always right
im quite uneasy at being always right so often its only another muddle of freddys
freddy doesnt even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead yes i do
ive got it
emerson what name emerson
ill bet you anything you like what a weathercock sir harry is said lucy quietly
i wish i had never bothered over it at all then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky
mr beebe whose opinion of her rose daily whispered to his niece that that was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong
meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted mrs honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities
emerson freddy
do you know what emersons they are i dont know whether theyre any emersons retorted freddy who was democratic
like his sister and like most young people he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of emersons annoyed him beyond measure
i trust they are the right sort of person
all right lucyshe was sitting up againi see you looking down your nose and thinking your mothers a snob
but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and its affectation to pretend there isnt emersons a common enough name lucy remarked
she was gazing sideways
seated on a promontory herself she could see the pine clad promontories descending one beyond another into the weald
the further one descended the garden the more glorious was this lateral view
i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man
pray does that satisfy you oh yes he grumbled
and you will be satisfied too for theyre friends of cecil soelaborate ironyyou and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety cecil exclaimed lucy
dont be rude dear said his mother placidly
lucy dont screech
its a new bad habit youre getting into but has cecil friends of cecils he repeated and so really dee sire rebel
ahem
honeychurch i have just telegraphed to them she got up from the grass
it was hard on lucy
mr beebe sympathized with her very much
while she believed that her snub about the miss alans came from sir harry otway she had borne it like a good girl
she might well screech when she heard that it came partly from her lover
mr vyse was a teasesomething worse than a tease he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people
the clergyman knowing this looked at miss honeychurch with more than his usual kindness
when she exclaimed but cecils emersonsthey cant possibly be the same onesthere is that he did not consider that the exclamation was strange but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure
he diverted it as follows the emersons who were at florence do you mean
no i dont suppose it will prove to be them
it is probably a long cry from them to friends of mr vyses
oh mrs honeychurch the oddest people
the queerest people
for our part we liked them didnt we he appealed to lucy
there was a great scene over some violets
they picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very miss alans who have failed to come to cissie villa
poor little ladies
so shocked and so pleased
it used to be one of miss catharines great stories
my dear sister loves flowers it began
they found the whole room a mass of bluevases and jugsand the story ends with so ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful it is all very difficult
yes i always connect those florentine emersons with violets fiascos done you this time remarked freddy not seeing that his sisters face was very red
she could not recover herself
mr beebe saw it and continued to divert the conversation
these particular emersons consisted of a father and a sonthe son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immaturepessimism et cetera
our special joy was the fathersuch a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife in his normal state mr beebe would never have repeated such gossip but he was trying to shelter lucy in her little trouble
he repeated any rubbish that came into his head
murdered his wife said mrs honeychurch
lucy dont desert usgo on playing bumble puppy
really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place
thats the second murderer ive heard of as being there
whatever was charlotte doing to stop
by the by we really must ask charlotte here some time mr beebe could recall no second murderer
he suggested that his hostess was mistaken
at the hint of opposition she warmed
she was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told
the name escaped her
what was the name
oh what was the name
she clasped her knees for the name
something in thackeray
she struck her matronly forehead
lucy asked her brother whether cecil was in
oh dont go he cried and tried to catch her by the ankles
i must go she said gravely
dont be silly
you always overdo it when you play as she left them her mothers shout of harris shivered the tranquil air and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right
such a senseless lie too yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these emersons friends of cecils with a pair of nondescript tourists
hitherto truth had come to her naturally
she saw that for the future she must be more vigilant and beabsolutely truthful
well at all events she must not tell lies
she hurried up the garden still flushed with shame
a word from cecil would soothe her she was sure
cecil hullo he called and leant out of the smoking room window
he seemed in high spirits
i was hoping youd come
i heard you all bear gardening but theres better fun up here
i even i have won a great victory for the comic muse
george merediths rightthe cause of comedy and the cause of truth are really the same and i even i have found tenants for the distressful cissie villa
dont be angry
dont be angry
youll forgive me when you hear it all he looked very attractive when his face was bright and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once
i have heard she said
freddy has told us
naughty cecil
i suppose i must forgive you
just think of all the trouble i took for nothing
certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and id rather have nice friends of yours
but you oughtnt to tease one so friends of mine he laughed
but lucy the whole joke is to come
come here but she remained standing where she was
do you know where i met these desirable tenants
in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week what an odd place to meet people she said nervously
i dont quite understand in the umbrian room
absolute strangers
they were admiring luca signorelliof course quite stupidly
however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little
they had been to italy but cecil proceeded hilariously
in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottagethe father to live there the son to run down for week ends
i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they werent actual blackguardsit was great sportand wrote to him making out cecil
no its not fair
ive probably met them before he bore her down
perfectly fair
anything is fair that punishes a snob
that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good
sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time
no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long youll agree with me
there ought to be intermarriageall sorts of things
i believe in democracy no you dont she snapped
you dont know what the word means he stared at her and felt again that she had failed to be leonardesque
no you dont her face was inartisticthat of a peevish virago
it isnt fair cecil
i blame youi blame you very much indeed
you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans and make me look ridiculous
you call it scoring off sir harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense
i consider it most disloyal of you she left him
temper he thought raising his eyebrows
no it was worse than tempersnobbishness
as long as lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the miss alans she had not minded
he perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally
he would tolerate the father and draw out the son who was silent
in the interests of the comic muse and of truth he would bring them to windy corner
chapter xi in mrs vyses well appointed flat the comic muse though able to look after her own interests did not disdain the assistance of mr vyse
his idea of bringing the emersons to windy corner struck her as decidedly good and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch
sir harry otway signed the agreement met mr emerson who was duly disillusioned
the miss alans were duly offended and wrote a dignified letter to lucy whom they held responsible for the failure
mr beebe planned pleasant moments for the new comers and told mrs honeychurch that freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived
indeed so ample was the muses equipment that she permitted mr harris never a very robust criminal to droop his head to be forgotten and to die
lucyto descend from bright heaven to earth whereon there are shadows because there are hillslucy was at first plunged into despair but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least
now that she was engaged the emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood
and cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood
therefore cecil was welcome to bring the emersons into the neighbourhood
but as i say this took a little thinking andso illogical are girlsthe event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done
she was glad that a visit to mrs vyse now fell due the tenants moved into cissie villa while she was safe in the london flat
cecilcecil darling she whispered the evening she arrived and crept into his arms
cecil too became demonstrative
he saw that the needful fire had been kindled in lucy
at last she longed for attention as a woman should and looked up to him because he was a man
so you do love me little thing he murmured
oh cecil i do i do
i dont know what i should do without you several days passed
then she had a letter from miss bartlett
a coolness had sprung up between the two cousins and they had not corresponded since they parted in august
the coolness dated from what charlotte would call the flight to rome and in rome it had increased amazingly
for the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical
charlotte unselfish in the forum would have tried a sweeter temper than lucys and once in the baths of caracalla they had doubted whether they could continue their tour
lucy had said she would join the vysesmrs
vyse was an acquaintance of her mother so there was no impropriety in the plan and miss bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly
finally nothing happened but the coolness remained and for lucy was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows
it had been forwarded from windy corner
tunbridge wells september
dearest lucia i have news of you at last
miss lavish has been bicycling in your parts but was not sure whether a call would be welcome
puncturing her tire near summer street and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard she saw to her astonishment a door open opposite and the younger emerson man come out
he said his father had just taken the house
he said he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood
he never suggested giving eleanor a cup of tea
dear lucy i am much worried and i advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother freddy and mr vyse who will forbid him to enter the house etc
that was a great misfortune and i dare say you have told them already
mr vyse is so sensitive
i remember how i used to get on his nerves at rome
i am very sorry about it all and should not feel easy unless i warned you
believe me your anxious and loving cousin charlotte lucy was much annoyed and replied as follows beauchamp mansions sw
dear charlotte many thanks for your warning
when mr emerson forgot himself on the mountain you made me promise not to tell mother because you said she would blame you for not being always with me
i have kept that promise and cannot possibly tell her now
i have said both to her and cecil that i met the emersons at florence and that they are respectable peoplewhich i do thinkand the reason that he offered miss lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself
she should have tried at the rectory
i cannot begin making a fuss at this stage
you must see that it would be too absurd
if the emersons heard i had complained of them they would think themselves of importance which is exactly what they are not
i like the old father and look forward to seeing him again
as for the son i am sorry for him when we meet rather than for myself
they are known to cecil who is very well and spoke of you the other day
we expect to be married in january
miss lavish cannot have told you much about me for i am not at windy corner at all but here
please do not put private outside your envelope again
no one opens my letters
yours affectionately l
m honeychurch secrecy has this disadvantage we lose the sense of proportion we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not
were lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy cecils life if he discovered it or with a little thing which he would laugh at
miss bartlett suggested the former
perhaps she was right
it had become a great thing now
left to herself lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously and it would have remained a little thing
emerson not harris it was only that a few weeks ago
she tried to tell cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school
but her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped
she and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on
it did her no harm cecil thought to learn the framework of society while society itself was absent on the golf links or the moors
the weather was cool and it did her no harm
in spite of the season mrs vyse managed to scrape together a dinner party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people
the food was poor but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl
one was tired of everything it seemed
one launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter
in this atmosphere the pension bertolini and windy corner appeared equally crude and lucy saw that her london career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past
the grandchildren asked her to play the piano
she played schumann
now some beethoven called cecil when the querulous beauty of the music had died
she shook her head and played schumann again
the melody rose unprofitably magical
it broke it was resumed broken not marching once from the cradle to the grave
the sadness of the incompletethe sadness that is often life but should never be artthrobbed in its disjected phrases and made the nerves of the audience throb
not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the bertolini and too much schumann was not the remark that mr beebe had passed to himself when she returned
when the guests were gone and lucy had gone to bed mrs vyse paced up and down the drawing room discussing her little party with her son
mrs vyse was a nice woman but her personality like many anothers had been swamped by london for it needs a strong head to live among many people
the too vast orb of her fate had crushed her and she had seen too many seasons too many cities too many men for her abilities and even with cecil she was mechanical and behaved as if he was not one son but so to speak a filial crowd
make lucy one of us she said looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence and straining her lips apart until she spoke again
lucy is becoming wonderfulwonderful her music always was wonderful yes but she is purging off the honeychurch taint most excellent honeychurches but you know what i mean
she is not always quoting servants or asking one how the pudding is made italy has done it perhaps she murmured thinking of the museum that represented italy to her
it is just possible
cecil mind you marry her next january
she is one of us already but her music he exclaimed
the style of her
how she kept to schumann when like an idiot i wanted beethoven
schumann was right for this evening
schumann was the thing
do you know mother i shall have our children educated just like lucy
bring them up among honest country folks for freshness send them to italy for subtlety and thennot till thenlet them come to london
i dont believe in these london educations he broke off remembering that he had had one himself and concluded at all events not for women make her one of us repeated mrs vyse and processed to bed
as she was dozing off a crythe cry of nightmarerang from lucys room
lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but mrs vyse thought it kind to go herself
she found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek
i am so sorry mrs vyseit is these dreams bad dreams just dreams the elder lady smiled and kissed her saying very distinctly you should have heard us talking about you dear
he admires you more than ever
dream of that lucy returned the kiss still covering one cheek with her hand
mrs vyse recessed to bed
cecil whom the cry had not awoke snored
darkness enveloped the flat
chapter xii twelfth chapter it was a saturday afternoon gay and brilliant after abundant rains and the spirit of youth dwelt in it though the season was now autumn
all that was gracious triumphed
as the motorcars passed through summer street they raised only a little dust and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines
mr beebe at leisure for lifes amenities leant over his rectory gate
freddy leant by him smoking a pendant pipe
suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little mm they might amuse you freddy whom his fellow creatures never amused suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy and so on since they had only just moved in
i suggested we should hinder them said mr beebe
they are worth it unlatching the gate he sauntered over the triangular green to cissie villa
hullo he cried shouting in at the open door through which much squalor was visible
a grave voice replied hullo ive brought someone to see you ill be down in a minute the passage was blocked by a wardrobe which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs
mr beebe edged round it with difficulty
the sitting room itself was blocked with books
are these people great readers freddy whispered
are they that sort i fancy they know how to reada rare accomplishment
what have they got
byron
exactly
a shropshire lad
never heard of it
the way of all flesh
never heard of it
gibbon
hullo
dear george reads german
umumschopenhauer nietzsche and so we go on
well i suppose your generation knows its own business honeychurch mr
beebe look at that said freddy in awestruck tones
on the cornice of the wardrobe the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes i know
isnt it jolly
i like that
im certain thats the old mans doing how very odd of him surely you agree but freddy was his mothers son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture
pictures the clergyman continued scrambling about the room
giottothey got that at florence ill be bound the same as lucys got oh by the by did miss honeychurch enjoy london she came back yesterday i suppose she had a good time yes very said freddy taking up a book
she and cecil are thicker than ever thats good hearing i wish i wasnt such a fool mr beebe mr beebe ignored the remark
lucy used to be nearly as stupid as i am but itll be very different now mother thinks
she will read all kinds of books so will you only medical books
not books that you can talk about afterwards
cecil is teaching lucy italian and he says her playing is wonderful
there are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed
cecil says what on earth are those people doing upstairs
emersonwe think well come another time george ran down stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking
let me introduce mr honeychurch a neighbour then freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth
perhaps he was shy perhaps he was friendly or perhaps he thought that georges face wanted washing
at all events he greeted him with how dye do
come and have a bathe oh all right said george impassive
mr beebe was highly entertained
how dye do
how dye do
come and have a bathe he chuckled
thats the best conversational opening ive ever heard
but im afraid it will only act between men
can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with how do you do
come and have a bathe
and yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal i tell you that they shall be said mr emerson who had been slowly descending the stairs
good afternoon mr beebe
i tell you they shall be comrades and george thinks the same we are to raise ladies to our level the clergyman inquired
the garden of eden pursued mr emerson still descending which you place in the past is really yet to come
we shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies mr beebe disclaimed placing the garden of eden anywhere
in thisnot in other thingswe men are ahead
we despise the body less than women do
but not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden i say what about this bathe murmured freddy appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him
i believed in a return to nature once
but how can we return to nature when we have never been with her
to day i believe that we must discover nature
after many conquests we shall attain simplicity
it is our heritage let me introduce mr honeychurch whose sister you will remember at florence how do you do
very glad to see you and that you are taking george for a bathe
very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry
marriage is a duty
i am sure that she will be happy for we know mr vyse too
he has been most kind
he met us by chance in the national gallery and arranged everything about this delightful house
though i hope i have not vexed sir harry otway
i have met so few liberal landowners and i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the conservative attitude
ah this wind
you do well to bathe
yours is a glorious country honeychurch not a bit mumbled freddy
i mustthat is to say i have tohave the pleasure of calling on you later on my mother says i hope call my lad
who taught us that drawing room twaddle
call on your grandmother
listen to the wind among the pines
yours is a glorious country mr beebe came to the rescue
mr
emerson he will call i shall call you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed
i trust that you have realized about the ten days interval
it does not count that i helped you with the stair eyes yesterday
it does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon yes go and bathe george
why do you dawdle talking
bring them back to tea
bring back some milk cakes honey
the change will do you good
george has been working very hard at his office
i cant believe hes well george bowed his head dusty and sombre exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture
do you really want this bathe freddy asked him
it is only a pond dont you know
i dare say you are used to something better yesi have said yes already mr beebe felt bound to assist his young friend and led the way out of the house and into the pine woods
how glorious it was
for a little time the voice of old mr emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy
it ceased and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees
mr beebe who could be silent but who could not bear silence was compelled to chatter since the expedition looked like a failure and neither of his companions would utter a word
he spoke of florence
george attended gravely assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree tops above their heads
and what a coincidence that you should meet mr vyse
did you realize that you would find all the pension bertolini down here i did not
miss lavish told me when i was a young man i always meant to write a history of coincidence no enthusiasm
though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose
for example it isnt purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect to his relief george began to talk
it is
i have reflected
it is fate
everything is fate
we are flung together by fate drawn apart by fateflung together drawn apart
the twelve winds blow uswe settle nothing you have not reflected at all rapped the clergyman
let me give you a useful tip emerson attribute nothing to fate
dont say i didnt do this for you did it ten to one
now ill cross question you
where did you first meet miss honeychurch and myself italy and where did you meet mr vyse who is going to marry miss honeychurch national gallery looking at italian art
there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate
you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends
this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it it is fate that i am here persisted george
but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy mr beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject
but he was infinitely tolerant of the young and had no desire to snub george
and so for this and for other reasons my history of coincidence is still to write silence
wishing to round off the episode he added we are all so glad that you have come silence
here we are called freddy
oh good exclaimed mr beebe mopping his brow
in theres the pond
i wish it was bigger he added apologetically
they climbed down a slippery bank of pine needles
there lay the pond set in its little alp of greenonly a pond but large enough to contain the human body and pure enough to reflect the sky
on account of the rains the waters had flooded the surrounding grass which showed like a beautiful emerald path tempting these feet towards the central pool
its distinctly successful as ponds go said mr beebe
no apologies are necessary for the pond george sat down where the ground was dry and drearily unlaced his boots
arent those masses of willow herb splendid
i love willow herb in seed
whats the name of this aromatic plant no one knew or seemed to care
these abrupt changes of vegetationthis little spongeous tract of water plants and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittleheather bracken hurts pines
very charming very charming mr
beebe arent you bathing called freddy as he stripped himself
mr beebe thought he was not
waters wonderful cried freddy prancing in
waters water murmured george
wetting his hair firsta sure sign of apathyhe followed freddy into the divine as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds
it was necessary to use his muscles
it was necessary to keep clean
mr beebe watched them and watched the seeds of the willow herb dance chorically above their heads
apooshoo apooshoo apooshoo went freddy swimming for two strokes in either direction and then becoming involved in reeds or mud
is it worth it asked the other michelangelesque on the flooded margin
the bank broke away and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly
hee poofive swallowed a pollywog mr beebe waters wonderful waters simply ripping waters not so bad said george reappearing from his plunge and sputtering at the sun
waters wonderful
mr beebe do apooshoo kouf mr beebe who was hot and who always acquiesced where possible looked around him
he could detect no parishioners except the pine trees rising up steeply on all sides and gesturing to each other against the blue
how glorious it was
the world of motor cars and rural deans receded inimitably
water sky evergreens a windthese things not even the seasons can touch and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man
i may as well wash too and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward and he too asserted the wonder of the water
it was ordinary water nor was there very much of it and as freddy said it reminded one of swimming in a salad
the three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high after the fashion of the nymphs in gtterdmmerung
but either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spiritfor some reason or other a change came over them and they forgot italy and botany and fate
they began to play
mr beebe and freddy splashed each other
a little deferentially they splashed george
he was quiet they feared they had offended him
then all the forces of youth burst out
he smiled flung himself at them splashed them ducked them kicked them muddied them and drove them out of the pool
race you round it then cried freddy and they raced in the sunshine and george took a short cut and dirtied his shins and had to bathe a second time
then mr beebe consented to runa memorable sight
they ran to get dry they bathed to get cool they played at being indians in the willow herbs and in the bracken they bathed to get clean
and all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward proclaiming no
we are what matters
without us shall no enterprise begin
to us shall all flesh turn in the end a try
a try yelled freddy snatching up georges bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal post
socker rules george retorted scattering freddys bundle with a kick
goal goal pass take care my watch cried mr beebe
clothes flew in all directions
take care my hat
no thats enough freddy
dress now
no i say but the two young men were delirious
away they twinkled into the trees freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm george with a wide awake hat on his dripping hair
thatll do shouted mr beebe remembering that after all he was in his own parish
then his voice changed as if every pine tree was a rural dean
hi
steady on
i see people coming you fellows yells and widening circles over the dappled earth
hi
hi
ladies neither george nor freddy was truly refined
still they did not hear mr beebes last warning or they would have avoided mrs honeychurch cecil and lucy who were walking down to call on old mrs butterworth
freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet and dashed into some bracken
george whooped in their faces turned and scudded away down the path to the pond still clad in mr beebes hat
gracious alive cried mrs honeychurch
whoever were those unfortunate people
oh dears look away
and poor mr beebe too
whatever has happened come this way immediately commanded cecil who always felt that he must lead women though he knew not whither and protect them though he knew not against what
he led them now towards the bracken where freddy sat concealed
oh poor mr beebe
was that his waistcoat we left in the path
cecil mr beebes waistcoat no business of ours said cecil glancing at lucy who was all parasol and evidently minded i fancy mr beebe jumped back into the pond this way please mrs honeychurch this way they followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions
well i cant help it said a voice close ahead and freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds
i cant be trodden on can i good gracious me dear so its you
what miserable management
why not have a comfortable bath at home with hot and cold laid on look here mother a fellow must wash and a fellows got to dry and if another fellow dear no doubt youre right as usual but you are in no position to argue
come lucy they turned
oh lookdont look
oh poor mr beebe
how unfortunate again for mr beebe was just crawling out of the pond on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float while george the world weary george shouted to freddy that he had hooked a fish
and me ive swallowed one answered he of the bracken
ive swallowed a pollywog
it wriggleth in my tummy
i shall dieemerson you beast youve got on my bags hush dears said mrs honeychurch who found it impossible to remain shocked
and do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first
all these colds come of not drying thoroughly mother do come away said lucy
oh for goodness sake do come hullo cried george so that again the ladies stopped
he regarded himself as dressed
barefoot bare chested radiant and personable against the shadowy woods he called hullo miss honeychurch
hullo bow lucy better bow
whoever is it
i shall bow miss honeychurch bowed
that evening and all that night the water ran away
on the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory
it had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will a passing benediction whose influence did not pass a holiness a spell a momentary chalice for youth
chapter xiii how miss bartletts boiler was so tiresome how often had lucy rehearsed this bow this interview
but she had always rehearsed them indoors and with certain accessories which surely we have a right to assume
who could foretell that she and george would meet in the rout of a civilization amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth
she had imagined a young mr emerson who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent
she was prepared for all of these
but she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star
indoors herself partaking of tea with old mrs butterworth she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy that it is impossible to rehearse life
a fault in the scenery a face in the audience an irruption of the audience on to the stage and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing or mean too much
i will bow she had thought
i will not shake hands with him
that will be just the proper thing she had bowedbut to whom
to gods to heroes to the nonsense of school girls
she had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world
so ran her thoughts while her faculties were busy with cecil
it was another of those dreadful engagement calls
mrs butterworth had wanted to see him and he did not want to be seen
he did not want to hear about hydrangeas why they change their colour at the seaside
he did not want to join the c o s when cross he was always elaborate and made long clever answers where yes or no would have done
lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace
no one is perfect and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock
miss bartlett indeed though not in word had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory
lucy though she disliked the teacher regarded the teaching as profound and applied it to her lover
lucy said her mother when they got home is anything the matter with cecil the question was ominous up till now mrs honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint
no i dont think so mother cecils all right perhaps hes tired lucy compromised perhaps cecil was a little tired
because otherwiseshe pulled out her bonnet pins with gathering displeasurebecause otherwise i cannot account for him i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that cecil has told you to think so
you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever
noit is just the same thing everywhere let me just put your bonnet away may i surely he could answer her civilly for one half hour cecil has a very high standard for people faltered lucy seeing trouble ahead
its part of his idealsit is really that that makes him sometimes seem oh rubbish
if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better said mrs honeychurch handing her the bonnet
now mother
ive seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself not in that way
at times i could wring her neck
but not in that way
no
it is the same with cecil all over by the byi never told you
i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london this attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile and mrs honeychurch resented it
since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him
whenever i speak he wincesi see him lucy it is useless to contradict me
no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawing room furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember ii see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtnt to
but he does not mean to be uncivilhe once explainedit is the things that upset himhe is easily upset by ugly thingshe is not uncivil to people is it a thing or a person when freddy sings you cant expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do then why didnt he leave the room
why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyones pleasure we mustnt be unjust to people faltered lucy
something had enfeebled her and the case for cecil which she had mastered so perfectly in london would not come forth in an effective form
the two civilizations had clashedcecil hinted that they mightand she was dazzled and bewildered as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes
good taste and bad taste were only catchwords garments of diverse cut and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine trees where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song
she remained in much embarrassment while mrs honeychurch changed her frock for dinner and every now and then she said a word and made things no better
there was no concealing the fact cecil had meant to be supercilious and he had succeeded
and lucyshe knew not whywished that the trouble could have come at any other time
go and dress dear youll be late all right mother dont say all right and stop
go she obeyed but loitered disconsolately at the landing window
it faced north so there was little view and no view of the sky
now as in the winter the pine trees hung close to her eyes
one connected the landing window with depression
no definite problem menaced her but she sighed to herself oh dear what shall i do what shall i do it seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly
and she ought not to have mentioned miss bartletts letter
she must be more careful her mother was rather inquisitive and might have asked what it was about
oh dear what should she doand then freddy came bounding upstairs and joined the ranks of the ill behaved
i say those are topping people my dear baby how tiresome youve been
you have no business to take them bathing in the sacred lake its much too public
it was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else
do be more careful
you forget the place is growing half suburban i say is anything on to morrow week not that i know of then i want to ask the emersons up to sunday tennis oh i wouldnt do that freddy i wouldnt do that with all this muddle whats wrong with the court
they wont mind a bump or two and ive ordered new balls i meant its better not
i really mean it he seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage
she pretended not to mind but she could have screamed with temper
cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded mary with her brood of hot water cans
then mrs honeychurch opened her door and said lucy what a noise youre making
i have something to say to you
did you say you had had a letter from charlotte and freddy ran away
yes
i really cant stop
i must dress too hows charlotte all right lucy the unfortunate girl returned
youve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of ones sentences
did charlotte mention her boiler her what dont you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible to doings i cant remember all charlottes worries said lucy bitterly
i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil mrs honeychurch might have flamed out
she did not
she said come here old ladythank you for putting away my bonnetkiss me and though nothing is perfect lucy felt for the moment that her mother and windy corner and the weald in the declining sun were perfect
so the grittiness went out of life
it generally did at windy corner
at the last minute when the social machine was clogged hopelessly one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil
cecil despised their methodsperhaps rightly
at all events they were not his own
dinner was at half past seven
freddy gabbled the grace and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to
fortunately the men were hungry
nothing untoward occurred until the pudding
then freddy said lucy whats emerson like i saw him in florence said lucy hoping that this would pass for a reply
is he the clever sort or is he a decent chap ask cecil it is cecil who brought him here he is the clever sort like myself said cecil
freddy looked at him doubtfully
how well did you know them at the bertolini asked mrs honeychurch
oh very slightly
i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did oh that reminds meyou never told me what charlotte said in her letter one thing and another said lucy wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie
among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if shed come up and see us and mercifully didnt lucy i do call the way you talk unkind she was a novelist said lucy craftily
the remark was a happy one for nothing roused mrs honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females
she would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who instead of minding their houses and their children seek notoriety by print
her attitude was if books must be written let them be written by men and she developed it at great length while cecil yawned and freddy played at this year next year now never with his plum stones and lucy artfully fed the flames of her mothers wrath
but soon the conflagration died down and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness
there were too many ghosts about
the original ghostthat touch of lips on her cheekhad surely been laid long ago it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once
but it had begotten a spectral familymr
harris miss bartletts letter mr beebes memories of violetsand one or other of these was bound to haunt her before cecils very eyes
it was miss bartlett who returned now and with appalling vividness
i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlottes
how is she i tore the thing up didnt she say how she was
how does she sound
cheerful oh yes i suppose sononot very cheerful i suppose then depend upon it it is the boiler
i know myself how water preys upon ones mind
i would rather anything elseeven a misfortune with the meat cecil laid his hand over his eyes
so would i asserted freddy backing his mother upbacking up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance
and i have been thinking she added rather nervously surely we could squeeze charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at tunbridge wells finish
i have not seen poor charlotte for so long it was more than her nerves could stand
and she could not protest violently after her mothers goodness to her upstairs
mother no she pleaded
its impossible
we cant have charlotte on the top of the other things were squeezed to death as it is
freddys got a friend coming tuesday theres cecil and youve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare
it simply cant be done nonsense
it can if minnie sleeps in the bath
not otherwise minnie can sleep with you i wont have her then if youre so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett moaned cecil again laying his hand over his eyes
its impossible repeated lucy
i dont want to make difficulties but it really isnt fair on the maids to fill up the house so alas
the truth is dear you dont like charlotte no i dont
and no more does cecil
she gets on our nerves
you havent seen her lately and dont realize how tiresome she can be though so good
so please mother dont worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come hear hear said cecil
mrs honeychurch with more gravity than usual and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself replied this isnt very kind of you two
you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers
you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old cecil crumbled his bread
i must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on my bike put in freddy
she thanked me for coming till i felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right i know dear
she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return but lucy hardened her heart
it was no good being kind to miss bartlett
she had tried herself too often and too recently
one might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt but one enriched neither miss bartlett nor any one else upon earth
she was reduced to saying i cant help it mother
i dont like charlotte
i admit its horrid of me from your own account you told her as much well she would leave florence so stupidly
she flurried the ghosts were returning they filled italy they were even usurping the places she had known as a child
the sacred lake would never be the same again and on sunday week something would even happen to windy corner
how would she fight against ghosts
for a moment the visible world faded away and memories and emotions alone seemed real
i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well said cecil who was in rather a happier frame of mind thanks to the admirable cooking
i didnt mean the egg was well boiled corrected freddy because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i dont care for eggs
i only meant how jolly kind she seemed cecil frowned again
oh these honeychurches
eggs boilers hydrangeas maidsof such were their lives compact
may me and lucy get down from our chairs he asked with scarcely veiled insolence
we dont want no dessert chapter xiv how lucy faced the external situation bravely of course miss bartlett accepted
and equally of course she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance and begged to be given an inferior spare roomsomething with no view anything
her love to lucy
and equally of course george emerson could come to tennis on the sunday week
lucy faced the situation bravely though like most of us she only faced the situation that encompassed her
she never gazed inwards
if at times strange images rose from the depths she put them down to nerves
when cecil brought the emersons to summer street it had upset her nerves
charlotte would burnish up past foolishness and this might upset her nerves
she was nervous at night
when she talked to georgethey met again almost immediately at the rectoryhis voice moved her deeply and she wished to remain near him
how dreadful if she really wished to remain near him
of course the wish was due to nerves which love to play such perverse tricks upon us
once she had suffered from things that came out of nothing and meant she didnt know what now cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed
it is obvious enough for the reader to conclude she loves young emerson a reader in lucys place would not find it obvious
life is easy to chronicle but bewildering to practice and we welcome nerves or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire
she loved cecil george made her nervous will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed
but the external situationshe will face that bravely
the meeting at the rectory had passed off well enough
standing between mr beebe and cecil she had made a few temperate allusions to italy and george had replied
she was anxious to show that she was not shy and was glad that he did not seem shy either
a nice fellow said mr beebe afterwards he will work off his crudities in time
i rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully lucy said he seems in better spirits
he laughs more yes replied the clergyman
he is waking up that was all
but as the week wore on more of her defences fell and she entertained an image that had physical beauty
in spite of the clearest directions miss bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival
she was due at the south eastern station at dorking whither mrs honeychurch drove to meet her
she arrived at the london and brighton station and had to hire a cab up
no one was at home except freddy and his friend who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour
cecil and lucy turned up at four oclock and these with little minnie beebe made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea
i shall never forgive myself said miss bartlett who kept on rising from her seat and had to be begged by the united company to remain
i have upset everything
bursting in on young people
but i insist on paying for my cab up
grant that at any rate our visitors never do such dreadful things said lucy while her brother in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial exclaimed in irritable tones just what ive been trying to convince cousin charlotte of lucy for the last half hour i do not feel myself an ordinary visitor said miss bartlett and looked at her frayed glove
all right if youd really rather
five shillings and i gave a bob to the driver miss bartlett looked in her purse
only sovereigns and pennies
could any one give her change
freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half crowns
miss bartlett accepted their moneys and then said but who am i to give the sovereign to lets leave it all till mother comes back suggested lucy
no dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me
we all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts here freddys friend mr floyd made the one remark of his that need be quoted he offered to toss freddy for miss bartletts quid
a solution seemed in sight and even cecil who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view felt the eternal attraction of chance and turned round
but this did not do either
pleasepleasei know i am a sad spoil sport but it would make me wretched
i should practically be robbing the one who lost freddy owes me fifteen shillings interposed cecil
so it will work out right if you give the pound to me fifteen shillings said miss bartlett dubiously
how is that mr vyse because dont you see freddy paid your cab
give me the pound and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling miss bartlett who was poor at figures became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths
for a moment cecil was happy
he was playing at nonsense among his peers
then he glanced at lucy in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles
in january he would rescue his leonardo from this stupefying twaddle
but i dont see that exclaimed minnie beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction
i dont see why mr vyse is to have the quid because of the fifteen shillings and the five they said solemnly
fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound you see but i dont see they tried to stifle her with cake
no thank you
im done
i dont see whyfreddy dont poke me
miss honeychurch your brothers hurting me
ow
what about mr floyds ten shillings
ow
no i dont see and i never shall see why miss whats her name shouldnt pay that bob for the driver i had forgotten the driver said miss bartlett reddening
thank you dear for reminding me
a shilling was it
can any one give me change for half a crown ill get it said the young hostess rising with decision
cecil give me that sovereign
no give me up that sovereign
ill get euphemia to change it and well start the whole thing again from the beginning lucylucywhat a nuisance i am protested miss bartlett and followed her across the lawn
lucy tripped ahead simulating hilarity
when they were out of earshot miss bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly have you told him about him yet no i havent replied lucy and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant
let me seea sovereigns worth of silver she escaped into the kitchen
miss bartletts sudden transitions were too uncanny
it sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul
no i havent told cecil or any one she remarked when she returned
i promised you i shouldnt
here is your moneyall shillings except two half crowns
would you count it
you can settle your debt nicely now miss bartlett was in the drawing room gazing at the photograph of st john ascending which had been framed
how dreadful she murmured how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source oh no charlotte said the girl entering the battle
george emerson is all right and what other source is there miss bartlett considered
for instance the driver
i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth lucy shuddered a little
we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we arent careful
how could a florentine cab driver ever get hold of cecil we must think of every possibility oh its all right or perhaps old mr emerson knows
in fact he is certain to know i dont care if he does
i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it to contradict it no to laugh at it but she knew in her heart that she could not trust him for he desired her untouched
very well dear you know best
perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young
ladies are certainly different now charlotte she struck at her playfully
you kind anxious thing
what would you have me do
first you say dont tell and then you say tell
which is it to be
quick miss bartlett sighed i am no match for you in conversation dearest
i blush when i think how i interfered at florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than i am
you will never forgive me shall we go out then
they will smash all the china if we dont for the air rang with the shrieks of minnie who was being scalped with a teaspoon
dear one momentwe may not have this chance for a chat again
have you seen the young one yet yes i have what happened we met at the rectory what line is he taking up no line
he talked about italy like any other person
it is really all right
what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly
i do wish i could make you see it my way
he really wont be any nuisance charlotte once a cad always a cad
that is my poor opinion lucy paused
cecil said one dayand i thought it so profoundthat there are two kinds of cadsthe conscious and the subconscious she paused again to be sure of doing justice to cecils profundity
through the window she saw cecil himself turning over the pages of a novel
it was a new one from smiths library
her mother must have returned from the station
once a cad always a cad droned miss bartlett
what i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head
i fell into all those violets and he was silly and surprised
i dont think we ought to blame him very much
it makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly
it really does it makes an enormous difference and he lost his head he doesnt admire me or any of that nonsense one straw
freddy rather likes him and has asked him up here on sunday so you can judge for yourself
he has improved he doesnt always look as if hes going to burst into tears
he is a clerk in the general managers office at one of the big railwaysnot a porter
and runs down to his father for week ends
papa was to do with journalism but is rheumatic and has retired
there
now for the garden she took hold of her guest by the arm
suppose we dont talk about this silly italian business any more
we want you to have a nice restful visit at windy corner with no worriting lucy thought this rather a good speech
the reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it
whether miss bartlett detected the slip one cannot say for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people
she might have spoken further but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess
explanations took place and in the midst of them lucy escaped the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain
chapter xv the disaster within the sunday after miss bartletts arrival was a glorious day like most of the days of that year
in the weald autumn approached breaking up the green monotony of summer touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist the beech trees with russet the oak trees with gold
up on the heights battalions of black pines witnessed the change themselves unchangeable
either country was spanned by a cloudless sky and in either arose the tinkle of church bells
the garden of windy corners was deserted except for a red book which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path
from the house came incoherent sounds as of females preparing for worship
the men say they wont gowell i dont blame themminnie says need she gotell her no nonsenseanne
mary
hook me behinddearest lucia may i trespass upon you for a pin for miss bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church
the sun rose higher on its journey guided not by phaethon but by apollo competent unswerving divine
its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows on mr beebe down at summer street as he smiled over a letter from miss catharine alan on george emerson cleaning his fathers boots and lastly to complete the catalogue of memorable things on the red book mentioned previously
the ladies move mr beebe moves george moves and movement may engender shadow
but this book lies motionless to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly as though acknowledging the caress
presently lucy steps out of the drawing room window
her new cerise dress has been a failure and makes her look tawdry and wan
at her throat is a garnet brooch on her finger a ring set with rubiesan engagement ring
her eyes are bent to the weald
she frowns a littlenot in anger but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry
in all that expanse no human eye is looking at her and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between apollo and the western hills
lucy
lucy
whats that book
whos been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil its only the library book that cecils been reading but pick it up and dont stand idling there like a flamingo lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly under a loggia
she no longer read novels herself devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching cecil up
it was dreadful how little she knew and even when she thought she knew a thing like the italian painters she found she had forgotten it
only this morning she had confused francesco francia with piero della francesca and cecil had said what
you arent forgetting your italy already and this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground and above them scarcely conceivable elsewhere the dear sun
lucyhave you a sixpence for minnie and a shilling for yourself she hastened in to her mother who was rapidly working herself into a sunday fluster
its a special collectioni forget what for
i do beg no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies see that minnie has a nice bright sixpence
where is the child
minnie
that books all warped
gracious how plain you look
put it under the atlas to press
minnie oh mrs honeychurch from the upper regions
minnie dont be late
here comes the horseit was always the horse never the carriage
wheres charlotte
run up and hurry her
why is she so long
she had nothing to do
she never brings anything but blouses
poor charlottehow i do detest blouses
minnie paganism is infectiousmore infectious than diphtheria or pietyand the rectors niece was taken to church protesting
as usual she didnt see why
why shouldnt she sit in the sun with the young men
the young men who had now appeared mocked her with ungenerous words
mrs honeychurch defended orthodoxy and in the midst of the confusion miss bartlett dressed in the very height of the fashion came strolling down the stairs
dear marian i am very sorry but i have no small changenothing but sovereigns and half crowns
could any one give me yes easily
jump in
gracious me how smart you look
what a lovely frock
you put us all to shame if i did not wear my best rags and tatters now when should i wear them said miss bartlett reproachfully
she got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse
the necessary roar ensued and then they drove off
good bye
be good called out cecil
lucy bit her lip for the tone was sneering
on the subject of church and so on they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation
he had said that people ought to overhaul themselves and she did not want to overhaul herself she did not know it was done
honest orthodoxy cecil respected but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis he could not imagine it as a natural birthright that might grow heavenward like flowers
all that he said on this subject pained her though he exuded tolerance from every pore somehow the emersons were different
she saw the emersons after church
there was a line of carriages down the road and the honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite cissie villa
to save time they walked over the green to it and found father and son smoking in the garden
introduce me said her mother
unless the young man considers that he knows me already he probably did but lucy ignored the sacred lake and introduced them formally
old mr emerson claimed her with much warmth and said how glad he was that she was going to be married
she said yes she was glad too and then as miss bartlett and minnie were lingering behind with mr beebe she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic and asked him how he liked his new house
very much he replied but there was a note of offence in his voice she had never known him offended before
he added we find though that the miss alans were coming and that we have turned them out
women mind such a thing
i am very much upset about it i believe that there was some misunderstanding said mrs honeychurch uneasily
our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person said george who seemed disposed to carry the matter further
he thought we should be artistic
he is disappointed and i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to give it up
what do you think he appealed to lucy
oh stop now you have come said lucy lightly
she must avoid censuring cecil
for it was on cecil that the little episode turned though his name was never mentioned
so george says
he says that the miss alans must go to the wall
yet it does seem so unkind there is only a certain amount of kindness in the world said george watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages
yes exclaimed mrs honeychurch
thats exactly what i say
why all this twiddling and twaddling over two miss alans there is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light he continued in measured tones
we cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows
choose a place where you wont do harmyes choose a place where you wont do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine oh mr emerson i see youre clever eh i see youre going to be clever
i hope you didnt go behaving like that to poor freddy georges eyes laughed and lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well
no i didnt he said
he behaved that way to me
it is his philosophy
only he starts life with it and i have tried the note of interrogation first what do you mean
no never mind what you mean
dont explain
he looks forward to seeing you this afternoon
do you play tennis
do you mind tennis on sunday george mind tennis on sunday
george after his education distinguish between sunday very well george doesnt mind tennis on sunday
no more do i thats settled
mr emerson if you could come with your son we should be so pleased he thanked her but the walk sounded rather far he could only potter about in these days
she turned to george and then he wants to give up his house to the miss alans i know said george and put his arm round his fathers neck
the kindness that mr beebe and lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly like sunlight touching a vast landscapea touch of the morning sun
she remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection
miss bartlett approached
you know our cousin miss bartlett said mrs honeychurch pleasantly
you met her with my daughter in florence yes indeed said the old man and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady
miss bartlett promptly got into the victoria
thus entrenched she emitted a formal bow
it was the pension bertolini again the dining table with the decanters of water and wine
it was the old old battle of the room with the view
george did not respond to the bow
like any boy he blushed and was ashamed he knew that the chaperon remembered
he said iill come up to tennis if i can manage it and went into the house
perhaps anything that he did would have pleased lucy but his awkwardness went straight to her heart men were not gods after all but as human and as clumsy as girls even men might suffer from unexplained desires and need help
to one of her upbringing and of her destination the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar but she had surmised it at florence when george threw her photographs into the river arno
george dont go cried his father who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them
george has been in such good spirits today and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon lucy caught her cousins eye
something in its mute appeal made her reckless
yes she said raising her voice i do hope he will then she went to the carriage and murmured the old man hasnt been told i knew it was all right mrs honeychurch followed her and they drove away
satisfactory that mr emerson had not been told of the florence escapade yet lucys spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven
satisfactory yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy
all the way home the horses hoofs sang a tune to her he has not told he has not told her brain expanded the melody he has not told his fatherto whom he tells all things
it was not an exploit
he did not laugh at me when i had gone she raised her hand to her cheek
he does not love me
no
how terrible if he did
but he has not told
he will not tell she longed to shout the words it is all right
its a secret between us two for ever
cecil will never hear she was even glad that miss bartlett had made her promise secrecy that last dark evening at florence when they had knelt packing in his room
the secret big or little was guarded
only three english people knew of it in the world
thus she interpreted her joy
she greeted cecil with unusual radiance because she felt so safe
as he helped her out of the carriage she said the emersons have been so nice
george emerson has improved enormously how are my protgs asked cecil who took no real interest in them and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to windy corner for educational purposes
protgs she exclaimed with some warmth
for the only relationship which cecil conceived was feudal that of protector and protected
he had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girls soul yearned
you shall see for yourself how your protgs are
george emerson is coming up this afternoon
he is a most interesting man to talk to
only dont she nearly said dont protect him but the bell was ringing for lunch and as often happened cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks
charm not argument was to be her forte
lunch was a cheerful meal
generally lucy was depressed at meals
some one had to be soothedeither cecil or miss bartlett or a being not visible to the mortal eyea being who whispered to her soul it will not last this cheerfulness
in january you must go to london to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men but to day she felt she had received a guarantee
her mother would always sit there her brother here
the sun though it had moved a little since the morning would never be hidden behind the western hills
after luncheon they asked her to play
she had seen glucks armide that year and played from memory the music of the enchanted gardenthe music to which renaud approaches beneath the light of an eternal dawn the music that never gains never wanes but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland
such music is not for the piano and her audience began to get restive and cecil sharing the discontent called out now play us the other gardenthe one in parsifal she closed the instrument
not very dutiful said her mothers voice
fearing that she had offended cecil she turned quickly round
there george was
he had crept in without interrupting her
oh i had no idea she exclaimed getting very red and then without a word of greeting she reopened the piano
cecil should have the parsifal and anything else that he liked
our performer has changed her mind said miss bartlett perhaps implying she will play the music to mr emerson
lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do
she played a few bars of the flower maidens song very badly and then she stopped
i vote tennis said freddy disgusted at the scrappy entertainment
yes so do i once more she closed the unfortunate piano
i vote you have a mens four all right not for me thank you said cecil
i will not spoil the set he never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth
oh come along cecil
im bad floyds rotten and so i dare says emerson george corrected him i am not bad one looked down ones nose at this
then certainly i wont play said cecil while miss bartlett under the impression that she was snubbing george added i agree with you mr vyse
you had much better not play
much better not minnie rushing in where cecil feared to tread announced that she would play
i shall miss every ball anyway so what does it matter but sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion
then it will have to be lucy said mrs honeychurch you must fall back on lucy
there is no other way out of it
lucy go and change your frock lucys sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature
she kept it without hypocrisy in the morning and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon
as she changed her frock she wondered whether cecil was sneering at her really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him
mr floyd was her partner
she liked music but how much better tennis seemed
how much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms
once more music appeared to her the employment of a child
george served and surprised her by his anxiety to win
she remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at santa croce because things wouldnt fit how after the death of that obscure italian he had leant over the parapet by the arno and said to her i shall want to live i tell you he wanted to live now to win at tennis to stand for all he was worth in the sunthe sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes and he did win
ah how beautiful the weald looked
the hills stood out above its radiance as fiesole stands above the tuscan plain and the south downs if one chose were the mountains of carrara
she might be forgetting her italy but she was noticing more things in her england
one could play a new game with the view and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for florence
ah how beautiful the weald looked
but now cecil claimed her
he chanced to be in a lucid critical mood and would not sympathize with exaltation
he had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others
he would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out i say listen to this lucy
three split infinitives dreadful said lucy and missed her stroke
when they had finished their set he still went on reading there was some murder scene and really everyone must listen to it
freddy and mr floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels but the other two acquiesced
the scene is laid in florence what fun cecil
read away
come mr emerson sit down after all your energy she had forgiven george as she put it and she made a point of being pleasant to him
he jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking youand are you tired of course im not do you mind being beaten she was going to answer no when it struck her that she did mind so she answered yes she added merrily i dont see youre such a splendid player though
the light was behind you and it was in my eyes i never said i was why you did you didnt attend you saidoh dont go in for accuracy at this house
we all exaggerate and we get very angry with people who dont the scene is laid in florence repeated cecil with an upward note
lucy recollected herself
sunset
leonora was speeding lucy interrupted
leonora
is leonora the heroine
whos the book by joseph emery prank
sunset
leonora speeding across the square
pray the saints she might not arrive too late
sunsetthe sunset of italy
under orcagnas loggiathe loggia de lanzi as we sometimes call it now lucy burst into laughter
joseph emery prank indeed
why its miss lavish
its miss lavishs novel and shes publishing it under somebody elses name who may miss lavish be oh a dreadful personmr
emerson you remember miss lavish excited by her pleasant afternoon she clapped her hands
george looked up
of course i do
i saw her the day i arrived at summer street
it was she who told me that you lived here werent you pleased she meant to see miss lavish but when he bent down to the grass without replying it struck her that she could mean something else
she watched his head which was almost resting against her knee and she thought that the ears were reddening
no wonder the novels bad she added
i never liked miss lavish
but i suppose one ought to read it as ones met her all modern books are bad said cecil who was annoyed at her inattention and vented his annoyance on literature
every one writes for money in these days oh cecil it is so
i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer cecil this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow
the ups and downs in his voice were noticeable but they did not affect her
she had dwelt amongst melody and movement and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his
leaving him to be annoyed she gazed at the black head again
she did not want to stroke it but she saw herself wanting to stroke it the sensation was curious
how do you like this view of ours mr emerson i never notice much difference in views what do you mean because theyre all alike
because all that matters in them is distance and air hm said cecil uncertain whether the remark was striking or not
my fatherhe looked up at her and he was a little flushedsays that there is only one perfect viewthe view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it i expect your father has been reading dante said cecil fingering the novel which alone permitted him to lead the conversation
he told us another day that views are really crowdscrowds of trees and houses and hillsand are bound to resemble each other like human crowdsand that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason lucys lips parted
for a crowd is more than the people who make it up
something gets added to itno one knows howjust as something has got added to those hills he pointed with his racquet to the south downs
what a splendid idea she murmured
i shall enjoy hearing your father talk again
im so sorry hes not so well no he isnt well theres an absurd account of a view in this book said cecil
also that men fall into two classesthose who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms mr
emerson have you any brothers or sisters none
why you spoke of us my mother i was meaning cecil closed the novel with a bang
oh cecilhow you made me jump i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer i can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as hindhead
it is the first thing that i remember cecil got up the man was ill bredhe hadnt put on his coat after tennishe didnt do
he would have strolled away if lucy had not stopped him
cecil do read the thing about the view not while mr emerson is here to entertain us noread away
i think nothings funnier than to hear silly things read out loud
if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go this struck cecil as subtle and pleased him
it put their visitor in the position of a prig
somewhat mollified he sat down again
mr
emerson go and find tennis balls she opened the book
cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked
but her attention wandered to georges mother whoaccording to mr eagerhad been murdered in the sight of god andaccording to her sonhad seen as far as hindhead
am i really to go asked george
no of course not really she answered
chapter two said cecil yawning
find me chapter two if it isnt bothering you chapter two was found and she glanced at its opening sentences
she thought she had gone mad
herehand me the book she heard her voice saying it isnt worth readingits too silly to readi never saw such rubbishit oughtnt to be allowed to be printed he took the book from her
leonora he read sat pensive and alone
before her lay the rich champaign of tuscany dotted over with many a smiling village
the season was spring miss lavish knew somehow and had printed the past in draggled prose for cecil to read and for george to hear
a golden haze he read
he read afar off the towers of florence while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets
all unobserved antonio stole up behind her lest cecil should see her face she turned to george and saw his face
he read there came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use
no eloquence was his nor did he suffer from the lack of it
he simply enfolded her in his manly arms this isnt the passage i wanted he informed them there is another much funnier further on he turned over the leaves
should we go in to tea said lucy whose voice remained steady
she led the way up the garden cecil following her george last
she thought a disaster was averted
but when they entered the shrubbery it came
the book as if it had not worked mischief enough had been forgotten and cecil must go back for it and george who loved passionately must blunder against her in the narrow path
no she gasped and for the second time was kissed by him
as if no more was possible he slipped back cecil rejoined her they reached the upper lawn alone
chapter xvi lying to george but lucy had developed since the spring
that is to say she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove
though the danger was greater she was not shaken by deep sobs
she said to cecil i am not coming in to teatell motheri must write some letters and went up to her room
then she prepared for action
love felt and returned love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet reappeared now as the worlds enemy and she must stifle it
she sent for miss bartlett
the contest lay not between love and duty
perhaps there never is such a contest
it lay between the real and the pretended and lucys first aim was to defeat herself
as her brain clouded over as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves
she conquered her breakdown tampering with the truth she forgot that the truth had ever been
remembering that she was engaged to cecil she compelled herself to confused remembrances of george he was nothing to her he never had been anything he had behaved abominably she had never encouraged him
the armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness and hides a man not only from others but from his own soul
in a few moments lucy was equipped for battle
something too awful has happened she began as soon as her cousin arrived
do you know anything about miss lavishs novel miss bartlett looked surprised and said that she had not read the book nor known that it was published eleanor was a reticent woman at heart
there is a scene in it
the hero and heroine make love
do you know about that dear do you know about it please she repeated
they are on a hillside and florence is in the distance my good lucia i am all at sea
i know nothing about it whatever there are violets
i cannot believe it is a coincidence
charlotte charlotte how could you have told her
i have thought before speaking it must be you told her what she asked with growing agitation
about that dreadful afternoon in february miss bartlett was genuinely moved
oh lucy dearest girlshe hasnt put that in her book lucy nodded
not so that one could recognize it
yes then nevernevernever more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine so you did tell i did just happenwhen i had tea with her at romein the course of conversation but charlottewhat about the promise you gave me when we were packing
why did you tell miss lavish when you wouldnt even let me tell mother i will never forgive eleanor
she has betrayed my confidence why did you tell her though
this is a most serious thing why does any one tell anything
the question is eternal and it was not surprising that miss bartlett should only sigh faintly in response
she had done wrongshe admitted it she only hoped that she had not done harm she had told eleanor in the strictest confidence
lucy stamped with irritation
cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again
behind cecils back
ugh
is it possible that men are such brutes
behind cecils back as we were walking up the garden miss bartlett burst into self accusations and regrets
what is to be done now
can you tell me oh lucyi shall never forgive myself never to my dying day
fancy if your prospects i know said lucy wincing at the word
i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by some other source you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable it was miss bartletts turn to wince
however said the girl despising her cousins shiftiness whats dones done
you have put me in a most awkward position
how am i to get out of it miss bartlett could not think
the days of her energy were over
she was a visitor not a chaperon and a discredited visitor at that
she stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage
he mustthat man must have such a setting down that he wont forget
and whos to give it him
i cant tell mother nowowing to you
nor cecil charlotte owing to you
i am caught up every way
i think i shall go mad
i have no one to help me
thats why ive sent for you
whats wanted is a man with a whip miss bartlett agreed one wanted a man with a whip
yesbut its no good agreeing
whats to be done we women go maundering on
what does a girl do when she comes across a cad i always said he was a cad dear
give me credit for that at all events
from the very first momentwhen he said his father was having a bath oh bother the credit and whos been right or wrong
weve both made a muddle of it
george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isnt he
i want to know miss bartlett was absolutely helpless
her own exposure had unnerved her and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain
she moved feebly to the window and tried to detect the cads white flannels among the laurels
you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome
cant you speak again to him now willingly would i move heaven and earth i want something more definite said lucy contemptuously
will you speak to him
it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine really charlotte was outdoing herself
yes or no please yes or no it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle george emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand
very well said lucy with an angry gesture
no one will help me
i will speak to him myself and immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along
hullo emerson called freddy from below
found the lost ball
good man
want any tea and there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace
oh lucy but that is brave of you
i admire you they had gathered round george who beckoned she felt over the rubbish the sloppy thoughts the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul
her anger faded at the sight of him
ah
the emersons were fine people in their way
she had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying freddy has taken him into the dining room
the others are going down the garden
come
let us get this over quickly
come
i want you in the room of course lucy do you mind doing it how can you ask such a ridiculous question poor lucy she stretched out her hand
i seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever i go lucy nodded
she remembered their last evening at florencethe packing the candle the shadow of miss bartletts toque on the door
she was not to be trapped by pathos a second time
eluding her cousins caress she led the way downstairs
try the jam freddy was saying
the jams jolly good george looking big and dishevelled was pacing up and down the dining room
as she entered he stopped and said nonothing to eat you go down to the others said lucy charlotte and i will give mr emerson all he wants
wheres mother shes started on her sunday writing
shes in the drawing room thats all right
you go away he went off singing
lucy sat down at the table
miss bartlett who was thoroughly frightened took up a book and pretended to read
she would not be drawn into an elaborate speech
she just said i cant have it mr emerson
i cannot even talk to you
go out of this house and never come into it again as long as i live here flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door
i hate a row
go please what no discussion but i cant she shook her head
go please
i do not want to call in mr vyse you dont mean he said absolutely ignoring miss bartlettyou dont mean that you are going to marry that man the line was unexpected
she shrugged her shoulders as if his vulgarity wearied her
you are merely ridiculous she said quietly
then his words rose gravely over hers you cannot live with vyse
hes only for an acquaintance
he is for society and cultivated talk
he should know no one intimately least of all a woman it was a new light on cecils character
have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired i can scarcely discuss no but have you ever
he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to thingsbooks picturesbut kill when they come to people
thats why ill speak out through all this muddle even now
its shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person
i would never have let myself go
but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters
then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour
that is the man all overplaying tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find
next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no
cecil all over again
he darent let a woman decide
hes the type whos kept europe back for a thousand years
every moment of his life hes forming you telling you whats charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own
so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon
thereforenot therefore i kissed you because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more self control
im not ashamed
i dont apologize
but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you
or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly
but thereforetherefore i settled to fight him lucy thought of a very good remark
you say mr vyse wants me to listen to him mr emerson
pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit and he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality
he said yes i have and sank down as if suddenly weary
im the same kind of brute at bottom
this desire to govern a womanit lies very deep and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden
but i do love you surely in a better way than he does he thought
yesreally in a better way
i want you to have your own thoughts even when i hold you in my arms he stretched them towards her
lucy be quicktheres no time for us to talk nowcome to me as you came in the spring and afterwards i will be gentle and explain
i have cared for you since that man died
i cannot live without you no good i thought she is marrying someone else but i meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun
as you came through the wood i saw that nothing else mattered
i called
i wanted to live and have my chance of joy and mr vyse said lucy who kept commendably calm
does he not matter
that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly
a detail of no importance i suppose but he stretched his arms over the table towards her
may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition he said it is our last chance
i shall do all that i can and as if he had done all else he turned to miss bartlett who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening
you wouldnt stop us this second time if you understood he said
i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards as though demolishing some invisible obstacle
she did not answer
it is being young he said quietly picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go
it is being certain that lucy cares for me really
it is that love and youth matter intellectually in silence the two women watched him
his last remark they knew was nonsense but was he going after it or not
would not he the cad the charlatan attempt a more dramatic finish
no
he was apparently content
he left them carefully closing the front door and when they looked through the hall window they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house
their tongues were loosed and they burst into stealthy rejoicings
oh luciacome back hereoh what an awful man lucy had no reactionat least not yet
well he amuses me she said
either im mad or else he is and im inclined to think its the latter
one more fuss through with you charlotte
many thanks
i think though that this is the last
my admirer will hardly trouble me again and miss bartlett too essayed the roguish well it isnt everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it
oh one oughtnt to laugh really
it might have been very serious
but you were so sensible and braveso unlike the girls of my day lets go down to them but once in the open air she paused
some emotionpity terror love but the emotion was strongseized her and she was aware of autumn
summer was ending and the evening brought her odours of decay the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring
that something or other mattered intellectually
a leaf violently agitated danced past her while other leaves lay motionless
that the earth was hastening to re enter darkness and the shadows of those trees over windy corner
hullo lucy
theres still light enough for another set if you twoll hurry mr
emerson has had to go what a nuisance
that spoils the four
i say cecil do play do theres a good chap
its floyds last day
do play tennis with us just this once cecils voice came my dear freddy i am no athlete
as you well remarked this very morning there are some chaps who are no good for anything but books i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you the scales fell from lucys eyes
how had she stood cecil for a moment
he was absolutely intolerable and the same evening she broke off her engagement
chapter xvii lying to cecil he was bewildered
he had nothing to say
he was not even angry but stood with a glass of whiskey between his hands trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion
she had chosen the moment before bed when in accordance with their bourgeois habit she always dispensed drinks to the men
freddy and mr floyd were sure to retire with their glasses while cecil invariably lingered sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard
i am very sorry about it she said i have carefully thought things over
we are too different
i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl it was a suitable speech but she was more angry than sorry and her voice showed it
differenthowhow i havent had a really good education for one thing she continued still on her knees by the sideboard
my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there
i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should i dont understand you
you arent like yourself
youre tired lucy tired she retorted kindling at once
that is exactly like you
you always think women dont mean what they say well you sound tired as if something has worried you what if i do
it doesnt prevent me from realizing the truth
i cant marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day you had that bad headache yesterdayall rightfor she had exclaimed indignantly i see its much more than headaches
but give me a moments time he closed his eyes
you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces
part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other parti find it difficulti am likely to say the wrong thing it struck her that he was not behaving so badly and her irritation increased
she again desired a struggle not a discussion
to bring on the crisis she said there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them
things must come to a breaking point some time and it happens to be to day
if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to youwhen you wouldnt play tennis with freddy i never do play tennis said cecil painfully bewildered i never could play
i dont understand a word you say you can play well enough to make up a four
i thought it abominably selfish of you no i cantwell never mind the tennis
why couldnt youcouldnt you have warned me if you felt anything wrong
you talked of our wedding at lunchat least you let me talk i knew you wouldnt understand said lucy quite crossly
i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations
of course it isnt the tennisthat was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks
surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain she developed this position
often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wifefor instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband
i dont think so
you dont like freddy nor my mother
there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it untilwell until all things came to a point
they have to day
i see clearly
i must speak
thats all i cannot think you were right said cecil gently
i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly
its all too horrible whats the good of a scene no good
but surely i have a right to hear a little more he put down his glass and opened the window
from where she knelt jangling her keys she could see a slit of darkness and peering into it as if it would tell him that little more his long thoughtful face
dont open the window and youd better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside he obeyed
i really think we had better go to bed if you dont mind
i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards
as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking but to cecil now that he was about to lose her she seemed each moment more desirable
he looked at her instead of through her for the first time since they were engaged
from a leonardo she had become a living woman with mysteries and forces of her own with qualities that even eluded art
his brain recovered from the shock and in a burst of genuine devotion he cried but i love you and i did think you loved me i did not she said
i thought i did at first
i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too he began to walk up and down the room and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour
she had counted on his being petty
it would have made things easier for her
by a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition
you dont love me evidently
i dare say you are right not to
but it would hurt a little less if i knew why becausea phrase came to her and she accepted ityoure the sort who cant know any one intimately a horrified look came into his eyes
i dont mean exactly that
but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something
it is that more or less
when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now youre always protecting me her voice swelled
i wont be protected
i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right
to shield me is an insult
cant i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it second hand through you
a womans place
you despise my motheri know you dobecause shes conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodnessshe rose to her feetconventional cecil youre that for you may understand beautiful things but you dont know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me
i wont be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me
thats why i break off my engagement
you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people she stopped
there was a pause
then cecil said with great emotion it is true true on the whole she corrected full of some vague shame
true every word
it is a revelation
it isi anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife he repeated the sort that can know no one intimately it is true
i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged
i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother
you are even greater than i thought she withdrew a step
im not going to worry you
you are far too good to me
i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldnt marry me and so have given me a chance to improve
i have never known you till this evening
i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be
but this evening you are a different person new thoughtseven a new voice what do you mean by a new voice she asked seized with incontrollable anger
i mean that a new person seems speaking through you said he
then she lost her balance
she cried if you think i am in love with some one else you are very much mistaken of course i dont think that
you are not that kind lucy oh yes you do think it
its your old idea the idea that has kept europe backi mean the idea that women are always thinking of men
if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says oh she had someone else in her mind she hopes to get someone else its disgusting brutal
as if a girl cant break it off for the sake of freedom he answered reverently i may have said that in the past
i shall never say it again
you have taught me better she began to redden and pretended to examine the windows again
of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity
i beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was
i only meant that there was a force in you that i hadnt known of up till now all right cecil that will do
dont apologize to me
it was my mistake it is a question between ideals yours and minepure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler
i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new his voice broke
i must actually thank you for what you have donefor showing me what i really am
solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman
will you shake hands of course i will said lucy twisting up her other hand in the curtains
good night cecil
good bye
thats all right
im sorry about it
thank you very much for your gentleness let me light your candle shall i they went into the hall
thank you
good night again
god bless you lucy good bye cecil she watched him steal up stairs while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings
on the landing he paused strong in his renunciation and gave her a look of memorable beauty
for all his culture cecil was an ascetic at heart and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it
she could never marry
in the tumult of her soul that stood firm
cecil believed in her she must some day believe in herself
she must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently who care for liberty and not for men she must forget that george loved her that george had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release that george had gone away intowhat was itthe darkness
she put out the lamp
it did not do to think nor for the matter of that to feel
she gave up trying to understand herself and joined the vast armies of the benighted who follow neither the heart nor the brain and march to their destiny by catch words
the armies are full of pleasant and pious folk
but they have yielded to the only enemy that mattersthe enemy within
they have sinned against passion and truth and vain will be their strife after virtue
as the years pass they are censured
their pleasantry and their piety show cracks their wit becomes cynicism their unselfishness hypocrisy they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go
they have sinned against eros and against pallas athene and not by any heavenly intervention but by the ordinary course of nature those allied deities will be avenged
lucy entered this army when she pretended to george that she did not love him and pretended to cecil that she loved no one
the night received her as it had received miss bartlett thirty years before
chapter xviii lying to mr beebe mrs honeychurch freddy and the servants windy corner lay not on the summit of the ridge but a few hundred feet down the southern slope at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill
on either side of it was a shallow ravine filled with ferns and pine trees and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the weald
whenever mr beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth and poised in the middle of them windy cornerhe laughed
the situation was so glorious the house so commonplace not to say impertinent
the late mr honeychurch had affected the cube because it gave him the most accommodation for his money and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret shaped like a rhinoceros horn where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road
so impertinentand yet the house did for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly
other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously yet all these suggested the accidental the temporary while windy corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of natures own creation
one might laugh at the house but one never shuddered
mr beebe was bicycling over this monday afternoon with a piece of gossip
he had heard from the miss alans
these admirable ladies since they could not go to cissie villa had changed their plans
they were going to greece instead
since florence did my poor sister so much good wrote miss catharine we do not see why we should not try athens this winter
of course athens is a plunge and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread but after all we can take that with us and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train
but is there an english church and the letter went on to say i do not expect we shall go any further than athens but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at constantinople we should be so grateful lucy would enjoy this letter and the smile with which mr beebe greeted windy corner was partly for her
she would see the fun of it and some of its beauty for she must see some beauty
though she was hopeless about pictures and though she dressed so unevenlyoh that cerise frock yesterday at churchshe must see some beauty in life or she could not play the piano as she did
he had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends that their psychology is a modern development and has not yet been understood
this theory had he known it had possibly just been illustrated by facts
ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea to see his niece and to observe whether miss honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit athens
a carriage was drawn up outside windy corner and just as he caught sight of the house it started bowled up the drive and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road
therefore it must be the horse who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him
the door opened obediently and two men emerged whom mr beebe recognized as cecil and freddy
they were an odd couple to go driving but he saw a trunk beside the coachmans legs
cecil who wore a bowler must be going away while freddy a capwas seeing him to the station
they walked rapidly taking the short cuts and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road
they shook hands with the clergyman but did not speak
so youre off for a minute mr vyse he asked
cecil said yes while freddy edged away
i was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of miss honeychurch he quoted from it
isnt it wonderful
isnt it romance
most certainly they will go to constantinople
they are taken in a snare that cannot fail
they will end by going round the world cecil listened civilly and said he was sure that lucy would be amused and interested
isnt romance capricious
i never notice it in you young people you do nothing but play lawn tennis and say that romance is dead while the miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing
a really comfortable pension at constantinople so they call it out of decency but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn
no ordinary view will content the miss alans
they want the pension keats im awfully sorry to interrupt mr beebe said freddy but have you any matches i have said cecil and it did not escape mr beebes notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly
you have never met these miss alans have you mr vyse never then you dont see the wonder of this greek visit
i havent been to greece myself and dont mean to go and i cant imagine any of my friends going
it is altogether too big for our little lot
dont you think so
italy is just about as much as we can manage
italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilishi am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus
all right freddyi am not being clever upon my word i am noti took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when youve done with them he lit a cigarette and went on talking to the two young men
i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian
big enough in all conscience
the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me
there the contrast is just as much as i can realize
but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria youre quite right said cecil
greece is not for our little lot and he got in
freddy followed nodding to the clergyman whom he trusted not to be pulling ones leg really
and before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out and came running back for vyses match box which had not been returned
as he took it he said im so glad you only talked about books
cecils hard hit
lucy wont marry him
if youd gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down but when late last night
i must go perhaps they wont want me down there nogo on
good bye thank goodness exclaimed mr beebe to himself and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly it was the one foolish thing she ever did
oh what a glorious riddance and after a little thought he negotiated the slope into windy corner light of heart
the house was again as it ought to becut off forever from cecils pretentious world
he would find miss minnie down in the garden
in the drawing room lucy was tinkling at a mozart sonata
he hesitated a moment but went down the garden as requested
there he found a mournful company
it was a blustering day and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias
mrs honeychurch who looked cross was tying them up while miss bartlett unsuitably dressed impeded her with offers of assistance
at a little distance stood minnie and the garden child a minute importation each holding either end of a long piece of bass
oh how do you do mr beebe
gracious what a mess everything is
look at my scarlet pompoms and the wind blowing your skirts about and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in and then the carriage having to go out when i had counted on having powell whogive everyone their duedoes tie up dahlias properly evidently mrs honeychurch was shattered
how do you do said miss bartlett with a meaning glance as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales
here lennie the bass cried mrs honeychurch
the garden child who did not know what bass was stood rooted to the path with horror
minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to day and that it was not her fault if dahlia strings would tear longways instead of across
come for a walk with me he told her
you have worried them as much as they can stand
mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly
i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may oh must you
yes donot the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full alreadyim perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it mr beebe who was an adept at relieving situations invited miss bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity
yes charlotte i dont want youdo go theres nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it miss bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed but when she had exasperated everyone except minnie by a refusal she turned round and exasperated minnie by an acceptance
as they walked up the garden the orange cactus fell and mr beebes last vision was of the garden child clasping it like a lover his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom
it is terrible this havoc among the flowers he remarked
it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment enunciated miss bartlett
perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother
or will she come with us i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits theyre angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast whispered minnie and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy wont play with me
in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday dont be a prig said her uncle arthur
go and put on your boots he stepped into the drawing room where lucy was still attentively pursuing the sonatas of mozart
she stopped when he entered
how do you do
miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at the beehive
would you come too i dont think i will thank you no i didnt suppose you would care to much lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords
how delicate those sonatas are said mr beebe though at the bottom of his heart he thought them silly little things
lucy passed into schumann
miss honeychurch yes i met them on the hill
your brother told me oh he did she sounded annoyed
mr beebe felt hurt for he had thought that she would like him to be told
i neednt say that it will go no further mother charlotte cecil freddy you said lucy playing a note for each person who knew and then playing a sixth note
if youll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing so i hoped other people would think but they dont seem to i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise so does mother
mother minds dreadfully i am very sorry for that said mr beebe with feeling
mrs honeychurch who hated all changes did mind but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended and only for the minute
it was really a ruse of lucys to justify her despondencya ruse of which she was not herself conscious for she was marching in the armies of darkness
and freddy minds still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he
i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you boys are so odd minnie could be heard arguing with miss bartlett through the floor
tea at the beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel
mr beebe saw that lucyvery properlydid not wish to discuss her action so after a sincere expression of sympathy he said i have had an absurd letter from miss alan
that was really what brought me over
i thought it might amuse you all how delightful said lucy in a dull voice
for the sake of something to do he began to read her the letter
after a few words her eyes grew alert and soon she interrupted him with going abroad
when do they start next week i gather did freddy say whether he was driving straight back no he didnt because i do hope he wont go gossiping so she did want to talk about her broken engagement
always complaisant he put the letter away
but she at once exclaimed in a high voice oh do tell me more about the miss alans
how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast she laughed heartily
oh delightful
i wish theyd take me has italy filled you with the fever of travel
perhaps george emerson is right
he says that italy is only an euphuism for fate oh not italy but constantinople
i have always longed to go to constantinople
constantinople is practically asia isnt it mr beebe reminded her that constantinople was still unlikely and that the miss alans only aimed at athens with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe but this made no difference to her enthusiasm
she had always longed to go to greece even more it seemed
he saw to his surprise that she was apparently serious
i didnt realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa oh thats nothing i assure you cissie villas nothing to me i would give anything to go with them would your mother spare you again so soon
you have scarcely been home three months she must spare me cried lucy in growing excitement
i simply must go away
i have to she ran her fingers hysterically through her hair
dont you see that i have to go away
i didnt realize at the timeand of course i want to see constantinople so particularly you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel yes yes
i knew youd understand mr beebe did not quite understand
why could not miss honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family
cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line and was not going to annoy her
then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying
he hinted this to her and she accepted the hint eagerly
yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down i am afraid it has been a bothersome business he said gently
no not at all
cecil was very kind indeed onlyi had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a littleit was that he is so masterful
i found that he wouldnt let me go my own way
he would improve me in places where i cant be improved
cecil wont let a woman decide for herselfin fact he darent
what nonsense i do talk
but that is the kind of thing it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you
i do sympathize and agree most profoundly
i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece but i must go somewhere she cried
i have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing she struck her knees with clenched fists and repeated i must
and the time i shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring
you all think much too highly of me
i wish you werent so kind at this moment miss bartlett entered and her nervousness increased
i must get away ever so far
i must know my own mind and where i want to go come along tea tea tea said mr beebe and bustled his guests out of the front door
he hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat
when he returned for it he heard to his relief and surprise the tinkling of a mozart sonata
she is playing again he said to miss bartlett
lucy can always play was the acid reply
one is very thankful that she has such a resource
she is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be
i know all about it
the marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak miss bartlett gave a kind of wriggle and he prepared for a discussion
he had never fathomed miss bartlett
as he had put it to himself at florence she might yet reveal depths of strangeness if not of meaning but she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable
he assumed that much and he had no hesitation in discussing lucy with her
minnie was fortunately collecting ferns
she opened the discussion with we had much better let the matter drop i wonder it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street
it would be death to gossip about mr vyses dismissal at the present moment mr beebe raised his eyebrows
death is a strong wordsurely too strong
there was no question of tragedy
he said of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses
freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind i know said miss bartlett civilly
yet freddy ought not to have told even you
one cannot be too careful quite so i do implore absolute secrecy
a chance word to a chattering friend and exactly he was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words
a rector lives in a web of petty secrets and confidences and warnings and the wiser he is the less he will regard them
he will change the subject as did mr beebe saying cheerfully have you heard from any bertolini people lately
i believe you keep up with miss lavish
it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one anothers lives
two three four six of usno eight i had forgotten the emersonshave kept more or less in touch
we must really give the signora a testimonial and miss bartlett not favouring the scheme they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern
on the summit they paused
the sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in surrey
grey clouds were charging across tissues of white which stretched and shredded and tore slowly until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue
summer was retreating
the wind roared the trees groaned yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven
the weather was breaking up breaking broken and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery
mr beebes eyes rested on windy corner where lucy sat practising mozart
no smile came to his lips and changing the subject again he said we shant have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on
the darkness last night was appalling they reached the beehive tavern at about five oclock
that amiable hostelry possesses a verandah in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room and have tea at a table comfortably
mr beebe saw that miss bartlett would be cold if she sat out and that minnie would be dull if she sat in so he proposed a division of forces
they would hand the child her food through the window
thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of lucy
i have been thinking miss bartlett he said and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion she bowed
nothing about the past
i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousins credit
she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her
but the future
seriously what do you think of this greek plan he pulled out the letter again
i dont know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career
its alli cant explainits wrong miss bartlett read the letter in silence laid it down seemed to hesitate and then read it again
i cant see the point of it myself to his astonishment she replied there i cannot agree with you
in it i spy lucys salvation really
now why she wanted to leave windy corner i knowbut it seems so odd so unlike her soi was going to sayselfish it is natural surelyafter such painful scenesthat she should desire a change here apparently was one of those points that the male intellect misses
mr beebe exclaimed so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced
perhaps she must have a change
i have no sisters orand i dont understand these things
but why need she go as far as greece you may well ask that replied miss bartlett who was evidently interested and had almost dropped her evasive manner
why greece
what is it minnie dearjam
why not tunbridge wells
oh mr beebe
i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this morning
i cannot help her
i will say no more
perhaps i have already said too much
i am not to talk
i wanted her to spend six months with me at tunbridge wells and she refused mr beebe poked at a crumb with his knife
but my feelings are of no importance
i know too well that i get on lucys nerves
our tour was a failure
she wanted to leave florence and when we got to rome she did not want to be in rome and all the time i felt that i was spending her mothers money let us keep to the future though interrupted mr beebe
i want your advice very well said charlotte with a choky abruptness that was new to him though familiar to lucy
i for one will help her to go to greece
will you mr beebe considered
it is absolutely necessary she continued lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion an intensity that surprised him
i knowi know the darkness was coming on and he felt that this odd woman really did know
she must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes
i trust that the servants know nothing
afterwardsbut i may have said too much already
only lucy and i are helpless against mrs honeychurch alone
if you help we may succeed
otherwise otherwise otherwise she repeated as if the word held finality
yes i will help her said the clergyman setting his jaw firm
come let us go back now and settle the whole thing up miss bartlett burst into florid gratitude
the tavern signa beehive trimmed evenly with beescreaked in the wind outside as she thanked him
mr beebe did not quite understand the situation but then he did not desire to understand it nor to jump to the conclusion of another man that would have attracted a grosser mind
he only felt that miss bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form
its very vagueness spurred him into knight errantry
his belief in celibacy so reticent so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower
they that marry do well but they that refrain do better so ran his belief and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure
in the case of lucy the feeling was intensified through dislike of cecil and he was willing to go furtherto place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity
the feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement
yet it existed and it alone explains his action subsequently and his influence on the action of others
the compact that he made with miss bartlett in the tavern was to help not only lucy but religion also
they hurried home through a world of black and grey
he conversed on indifferent topics the emersons need of a housekeeper servants italian servants novels about italy novels with a purpose could literature influence life
windy corner glimmered
in the garden mrs honeychurch now helped by freddy still wrestled with the lives of her flowers
it gets too dark she said hopelessly
this comes of putting off
we might have known the weather would break up soon and now lucy wants to go to greece
i dont know what the worlds coming to mrs
honeychurch he said go to greece she must
come up to the house and lets talk it over
do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse mr
beebe im thankfulsimply thankful so am i said freddy
good
now come up to the house they conferred in the dining room for half an hour
lucy would never have carried the greek scheme alone
it was expensive and dramaticboth qualities that her mother loathed
nor would charlotte have succeeded
the honours of the day rested with mr beebe
by his tact and common sense and by his influence as a clergymanfor a clergyman who was not a fool influenced mrs honeychurch greatlyhe bent her to their purpose i dont see why greece is necessary she said but as you do i suppose it is all right
it must be something i cant understand
lucy
lets tell her
lucy she is playing the piano mr beebe said
he opened the door and heard the words of a song look not thou on beautys charming i didnt know that miss honeychurch sang too sit thou still when kings are arming taste not when the wine cup glistens its a song that cecil gave her
how odd girls are whats that called lucy stopping short
all right dear said mrs honeychurch kindly
she went into the drawing room and mr beebe heard her kiss lucy and say i am sorry i was so cross about greece but it came on the top of the dahlias rather a hard voice said thank you mother that doesnt matter a bit and you are right toogreece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you oh splendid
oh thank you mr beebe followed
lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys
she was glad but he had expected greater gladness
her mother bent over her
freddy to whom she had been singing reclined on the floor with his head against her and an unlit pipe between his lips
oddly enough the group was beautiful
mr beebe who loved the art of the past was reminded of a favourite theme the santa conversazione in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble thingsa theme neither sensual nor sensational and therefore ignored by the art of to day
why should lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home
taste not when the wine cup glistens speak not when the people listens she continued
heres mr beebe mr
beebe knows my rude ways its a beautiful song and a wise one said he
go on it isnt very good she said listlessly
i forget whyharmony or something i suspected it was unscholarly
its so beautiful the tunes right enough said freddy but the words are rotten
why throw up the sponge how stupidly you talk said his sister
the santa conversazione was broken up
after all there was no reason that lucy should talk about greece or thank him for persuading her mother so he said good bye
freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch and with his usual felicity of phrase said this has been a day and a half stop thine ear against the singer wait a minute she is finishing from the red gold keep thy finger vacant heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet die i love weather like this said freddy
mr beebe passed into it
the two main facts were clear
she had behaved splendidly and he had helped her
he could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girls life
if here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled he must acquiesce she was choosing the better part
vacant heart and hand and eye perhaps the song stated the better part rather too strongly
he half fancied that the soaring accompanimentwhich he did not lose in the shout of the galereally agreed with freddy and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned vacant heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet die however for the fourth time windy corner lay poised below himnow as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness
chapter xix lying to mr emerson the miss alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near bloomsburya clean airless establishment much patronized by provincial england
they always perched there before crossing the great seas and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes guide books mackintosh squares digestive bread and other continental necessaries
that there are shops abroad even in athens never occurred to them for they regarded travel as a species of warfare only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the haymarket stores
miss honeychurch they trusted would take care to equip herself duly
quinine could now be obtained in tabloids paper soap was a great help towards freshening up ones face in the train
lucy promised a little depressed
but of course you know all about these things and you have mr vyse to help you
a gentleman is such a stand by mrs honeychurch who had come up to town with her daughter began to drum nervously upon her card case
we think it so good of mr vyse to spare you miss catharine continued
it is not every young man who would be so unselfish
but perhaps he will come out and join you later on or does his work keep him in london said miss teresa the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters
however we shall see him when he sees you off
i do so long to see him no one will see lucy off interposed mrs honeychurch
she doesnt like it no i hate seeings off said lucy
really
how funny
i should have thought that in this case oh mrs honeychurch you arent going
it is such a pleasure to have met you they escaped and lucy said with relief thats all right
we just got through that time but her mother was annoyed
i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic
but i cannot see why you didnt tell your friends about cecil and be done with it
there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant lucy had plenty to say in reply
she described the miss alans character they were such gossips and if one told them the news would be everywhere in no time
but why shouldnt it be everywhere in no time because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england
i shall tell them then
its much pleasanter
how wet it is
lets turn in here here was the british museum
mrs honeychurch refused
if they must take shelter let it be in a shop
lucy felt contemptuous for she was on the tack of caring for greek sculpture and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from mr beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods
oh well let it be shop then
lets go to mudies
ill buy a guide book you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me im so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this hole and corner work
youve got rid of cecilwell and good and im thankful hes gone though i did feel angry for the minute
but why not announce it
why this hushing up and tip toeing its only for a few days but why at all lucy was silent
she was drifting away from her mother
it was quite easy to say because george emerson has been bothering me and if he hears ive given up cecil may begin againquite easy and it had the incidental advantage of being true
but she could not say it
she disliked confidences for they might lead to self knowledge and to that king of terrorslight
ever since that last evening at florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul
mrs honeychurch too was silent
she was thinking my daughter wont answer me she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with freddy and me
any rag tag and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home and as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long she burst out with youre tired of windy corner this was perfectly true
lucy had hoped to return to windy corner when she escaped from cecil but she discovered that her home existed no longer
it might exist for freddy who still lived and thought straight but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain
she did not acknowledge that her brain was warped for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment and she was disordering the very instruments of life
she only felt i do not love george i broke off my engagement because i did not love george i must go to greece because i do not love george it is more important that i should look up gods in the dictionary than that i should help my mother everyone else is behaving very badly she only felt irritable and petulant and anxious to do what she was not expected to do and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation
oh mother what rubbish you talk
of course im not tired of windy corner then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour she laughed faintly half a minute would be nearer perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether hush mother
people will hear you for they had entered mudies
she bought baedeker and then continued of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been
you see i come into my money next year tears came into her mothers eyes
driven by nameless bewilderment by what is in older people termed eccentricity lucy determined to make this point clear
ive seen the world so littlei felt so out of things in italy
i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london morenot a cheap ticket like to day but to stop
i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl and mess with typewriters and latch keys exploded mrs honeychurch
and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police
and call it a missionwhen no one wants you
and call it dutywhen it means that you cant stand your own home
and call it workwhen thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is
and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them i want more independence said lucy lamely she knew that she wanted something and independence is a useful cry we can always say that we have not got it
she tried to remember her emotions in florence those had been sincere and passionate and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch keys
but independence was certainly her cue
very well
take your independence and be gone
rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food
despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear viewand then share a flat with another girl lucy screwed up her mouth and said perhaps i spoke hastily oh goodness her mother flashed
how you do remind me of charlotte bartlett charlotte flashed lucy in her turn pierced at last by a vivid pain
more every moment i dont know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike well i see the likeness
the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words
you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters what rubbish
and if you dislike charlotte so its rather a pity you asked her to stop
i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to there you go i beg your pardon charlotte again my dear thats all her very words lucy clenched her teeth
my point is that you oughtnt to have asked charlotte to stop
i wish you would keep to the point and the conversation died off into a wrangle
she and her mother shopped in silence spoke little in the train little again in the carriage which met them at dorking station
it had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over hanging beech trees and rattled on the hood
lucy complained that the hood was stuffy
leaning forward she looked out into the steaming dusk and watched the carriage lamp pass like a search light over mud and leaves and reveal nothing beautiful
the crush when charlotte gets in will be abominable she remarked
for they were to pick up miss bartlett at summer street where she had been dropped as the carriage went down to pay a call on mr beebes old mother
we shall have to sit three a side because the trees drop and yet it isnt raining
oh for a little air then she listened to the horses hoofshe has not toldhe has not told that melody was blurred by the soft road
cant we have the hood down she demanded and her mother with sudden tenderness said very well old lady stop the horse and the horse was stopped and lucy and powell wrestled with the hood and squirted water down mrs honeychurchs neck
but now that the hood was down she did see something that she would have missedthere were no lights in the windows of cissie villa and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock
is that house to let again powell she called
yes miss he replied
have they gone it is too far out of town for the young gentleman and his fathers rheumatism has come on so he cant stop on alone so they are trying to let furnished was the answer
they have gone then yes miss they have gone lucy sank back
the carriage stopped at the rectory
she got out to call for miss bartlett
so the emersons had gone and all this bother about greece had been unnecessary
waste
that word seemed to sum up the whole of life
wasted plans wasted money wasted love and she had wounded her mother
was it possible that she had muddled things away
quite possible
other people had
when the maid opened the door she was unable to speak and stared stupidly into the hall
miss bartlett at once came forward and after a long preamble asked a great favour might she go to church
mr beebe and his mother had already gone but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostesss full sanction for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more
certainly said the hostess wearily
i forgot it was friday
lets all go
powell can go round to the stables lucy dearest no church for me thank you a sigh and they departed
the church was invisible but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour
this was a stained window through which some feeble light was shining and when the door opened lucy heard mr beebes voice running through the litany to a minute congregation
even their church built upon the slope of the hill so artfully with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingleeven their church had lost its charm and the thing one never talked aboutreligionwas fading like all the other things
she followed the maid into the rectory
would she object to sitting in mr beebes study
there was only that one fire
she would not object
some one was there already for lucy heard the words a lady to wait sir old mr emerson was sitting by the fire with his foot upon a gout stool
oh miss honeychurch that you should come he quavered and lucy saw an alteration in him since last sunday
not a word would come to her lips
george she had faced and could have faced again but she had forgotten how to treat his father
miss honeychurch dear we are so sorry
george is so sorry
he thought he had a right to try
i cannot blame my boy and yet i wish he had told me first
he ought not to have tried
i knew nothing about it at all if only she could remember how to behave
he held up his hand
but you must not scold him lucy turned her back and began to look at mr beebes books
i taught him he quavered to trust in love
i said when love comes that is reality i said passion does not blind
no
passion is sanity and the woman you love she is the only person you will ever really understand he sighed true everlastingly true though my day is over and though there is the result
poor boy
he is so sorry
he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in that whatever you felt you did not mean
yethis voice gathered strength he spoke out to make certainmiss honeychurch do you remember italy lucy selected a booka volume of old testament commentaries
holding it up to her eyes she said i have no wish to discuss italy or any subject connected with your son but you do remember it he has misbehaved himself from the first i only was told that he loved you last sunday
i never could judge behaviour
iisuppose he has feeling a little steadier she put the book back and turned round to him
his face was drooping and swollen but his eyes though they were sunken deep gleamed with a childs courage
why he has behaved abominably she said
i am glad he is sorry
do you know what he did not abominably was the gentle correction
he only tried when he should not have tried
you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love
do not go out of georges life saying he is abominable no of course said lucy ashamed at the reference to cecil
abominable is much too strong
i am sorry i used it about your son
i think i will go to church after all
my mother and my cousin have gone
i shall not be so very late especially as he has gone under he said quietly
what was that gone under naturally he beat his palms together in silence his head fell on his chest
i dont understand as his mother did but mr emersonmr
emersonwhat are you talking about when i wouldnt have george baptized said he
lucy was frightened
and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round
she thought it a judgement he shuddered
oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents
oh horribleworst of allworse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again
a judgement
and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church
is it possible miss honeychurch
shall we slip back into the darkness for ever i dont know gasped lucy
i dont understand this sort of thing
i was not meant to understand it but mr eagerhe came when i was out and acted according to his principles
i dont blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill
he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it it was thus that mr emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of god
oh how terrible said lucy forgetting her own affairs at last
he was not baptized said the old man
i did hold firm and he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books as ifat what costhe had won a victory over them
my boy shall go back to the earth untouched she asked whether young mr emerson was ill ohlast sunday he started into the present
george last sundayno not ill just gone under
he is never ill
but he is his mothers son
her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live
it was always touch and go
he will live but he will not think it worth while to live
he will never think anything worth while
you remember that church at florence lucy did remember and how she had suggested that george should collect postage stamps
after you left florencehorrible
then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better
you saw him bathing i am so sorry but it is no good discussing this affair
i am deeply sorry about it then there came something about a novel
i didnt follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old
ah well one must have failures
george comes down to morrow and takes me up to his london rooms
he cant bear to be about here and i must be where he is mr
emerson cried the girl dont leave at least not on my account

how good everyone is
and look at mr beebe housing mecame over this morning and heard i was going
here i am so comfortable with a fire yes but you wont go back to london

he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about youi am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened oh mr emersonshe took hold of his handyou mustnt
ive been bother enough to the world by now
i cant have you moving out of your house when you like it and perhaps losing money through itall on my account

you wont talk about this business i know
i can trust you both certainly you can
we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen i shouldnt want i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george
no it was wrong of george to try
we have pushed our beliefs too far
i fancy that we deserve sorrow she looked at the books againblack brown and that acrid theological blue
they surrounded the visitors on every side they were piled on the tables they pressed against the very ceiling
to lucy who could not see that mr emerson was profoundly religious and differed from mr beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passionit seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum when he was unhappy and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman
more certain than ever that she was tired he offered her his chair
no please sit still
i think i will sit in the carriage miss honeychurch you do sound tired not a bit said lucy with trembling lips
but you are and theres a look of george about you
and what were you saying about going abroad she was silent
greeceand she saw that he was thinking the word overgreece but you were to be married this year i thought not till january it wasnt said lucy clasping her hands
would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point
i suppose that mr vyse is going with you
i hopeit isnt because george spoke that you are both going no i hope that you will enjoy greece with mr vyse thank you at that moment mr beebe came back from church
his cassock was covered with rain
thats all right he said kindly
i counted on you two keeping each other company
its pouring again
the entire congregation which consists of your cousin your mother and my mother stands waiting in the church till the carriage fetches it
did powell go round i think so ill see noof course ill see
how are the miss alans very well thank you did you tell mr emerson about greece ii did dont you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans
now miss honeychurch go backkeep warm
i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling and he hurried off to the stables
he is not going she said hoarsely
i made a slip
mr vyse does stop behind in england somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man
to george to cecil she would have lied again but he seemed so near the end of things so dignified in his approach to the gulf of which he gave one account and the books that surrounded him another so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed that the true chivalrynot the worn out chivalry of sex but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the oldawoke in her and at whatever risk she told him that cecil was not her companion to greece
and she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty and he lifting his eyes said you are leaving him
you are leaving the man you love ii had to why miss honeychurch why terror came over her and she lied again
she made the long convincing speech that she had made to mr beebe and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more
he heard her in silence and then said my dear i am worried about you
it seems to medreamily she was not alarmedthat you are in a muddle she shook her head
take an old mans word theres nothing worse than a muddle in all the world
it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful
it is on my muddles that i look back with horroron the things that i might have avoided
we can help one another but little
i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle
do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and werent
do you remember before when you refused the room with the view
those were muddleslittle but ominousand i am fearing that you are in one now she was silent
dont trust me miss honeychurch
though life is very glorious it is difficult she was still silent
life wrote a friend of mine is a public performance on the violin in which you must learn the instrument as you go along i think he puts it well
man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes alongespecially the function of love then he burst out excitedly thats it thats what i mean
you love george and after his long preamble the three words burst against lucy like waves from the open sea
but you do he went on not waiting for contradiction
you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it
you wont marry the other man for his sake how dare you gasped lucy with the roaring of waters in her ears
oh how like a mani mean to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man but you are she summoned physical disgust
youre shocked but i mean to shock you
its the only hope at times
i can reach you no other way
you must marry or your life will be wasted
you have gone too far to retreat
i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry
i know that with george you will find them and that you love him
then be his wife
he is already part of you
though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die
it isnt possible to love and to part
you will wish that it was
you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you
i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal lucy began to cry with anger and though her anger passed away soon her tears remained
i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body
ah
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that
ah
for a little directness to liberate the soul
your soul dear lucy
i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round
but we have souls
i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours
i cannot bear it
it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell then he checked himself
what nonsense i have talkedhow abstract and remote
and i have made you cry
dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy
when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by lovemarry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made she could not understand him the words were indeed remote
yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn veil after veil and she saw to the bottom of her soul
then lucy youve frightened me she moaned
cecilmr
beebethe tickets boughteverything she fell sobbing into the chair
im caught in the tangle
i must suffer and grow old away from him
i cannot break the whole of life for his sake
they trusted me a carriage drew up at the front door
give george my loveonce only
tell him muddle then she arranged her veil while the tears poured over her cheeks inside
lucy nothey are in the halloh please not mr emersonthey trust me but why should they when you have deceived them mr beebe opened the door saying heres my mother youre not worthy of their trust whats that said mr beebe sharply
i was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you one minute mother he came in and shut the door
i dont follow you mr emerson
to whom do you refer
trust whom i mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george
they have loved one another all along mr beebe looked at the sobbing girl
he was very quiet and his white face with its ruddy whiskers seemed suddenly inhuman
a long black column he stood and awaited her reply
i shall never marry him quavered lucy
a look of contempt came over him and he said why not mr
beebei have misled youi have misled myself oh rubbish miss honeychurch it is not rubbish said the old man hotly
its the part of people that you dont understand mr beebe laid his hand on the old mans shoulder pleasantly
lucy
lucy called voices from the carriage
mr
beebe could you help me he looked amazed at the request and said in a low stern voice i am more grieved than i can possibly express
it is lamentable lamentableincredible whats wrong with the boy fired up the other again
nothing mr emerson except that he no longer interests me
marry george miss honeychurch
he will do admirably he walked out and left them
they heard him guiding his mother up stairs
lucy the voices called
she turned to mr emerson in despair
but his face revived her
it was the face of a saint who understood
now it is all dark
now beauty and passion seem never to have existed
i know
but remember the mountains over florence and the view
ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave
you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise
george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him
am i justified into his own eyes tears came
yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth
truth counts truth does count you kiss me said the girl
you kiss me
i will try he gave her a sense of deities reconciled a feeling that in gaining the man she loved she would gain something for the whole world
throughout the squalor of her homeward driveshe spoke at oncehis salutation remained
he had robbed the body of its taint the worlds taunts of their sting he had shown her the holiness of direct desire
she never exactly understood she would say in after years how he managed to strengthen her
it was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once chapter xx the end of the middle ages the miss alans did go to greece but they went by themselves
they alone of this little company will double malea and plough the waters of the saronic gulf
they alone will visit athens and delphi and either shrine of intellectual songthat upon the acropolis encircled by blue seas that under parnassus where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity
trembling anxious cumbered with much digestive bread they did proceed to constantinople they did go round the world
the rest of us must be contented with a fair but a less arduous goal
italiam petimus we return to the pension bertolini
george said it was his old room
no it isnt said lucy because it is the room i had and i had your fathers room
i forget why charlotte made me for some reason he knelt on the tiled floor and laid his face in her lap
george you baby get up why shouldnt i be a baby murmured george
unable to answer this question she put down his sock which she was trying to mend and gazed out through the window
it was evening and again the spring
oh bother charlotte she said thoughtfully
what can such people be made of same stuff as parsons are made of nonsense quite right
it is nonsense now you get up off the cold floor or youll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly why shouldnt i laugh he asked pinning her with his elbows and advancing his face to hers
whats there to cry at
kiss me here he indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome
he was a boy after all
when it came to the point it was she who remembered the past she into whose soul the iron had entered she who knew whose room this had been last year
it endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong
any letters he asked
just a line from freddy now kiss me here then here then threatened again with rheumatism he strolled to the window opened it as the english will and leant out
there was the parapet there the river there to the left the beginnings of the hills
the cab driver who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent might be that very phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago
a passion of gratitudeall feelings grow to passions in the southcame over the husband and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool
he had helped himself it is true but how stupidly
all the fighting that mattered had been done by othersby italy by his father by his wife
lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows san miniato
ill just finish your sock signorino domani faremo uno giro called the cabman with engaging certainty
george told him that he was mistaken they had no money to throw away on driving
and the people who had not meant to helpthe miss lavishes the cecils the miss bartletts
ever prone to magnify fate george counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment
anything good in freddys letter not yet his own content was absolute but hers held bitterness the honeychurches had not forgiven them they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy she had alienated windy corner perhaps for ever
what does he say silly boy
he thinks hes being dignified
he knew we should go off in the springhe has known it for six monthsthat if mother wouldnt give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands
they had fair warning and now he calls it an elopement
ridiculous boy signorino domani faremo uno giro but it will all come right in the end
he has to build us both up from the beginning again
i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women
he has for the second time quite altered
why will men have theories about women
i havent any about men
i wish too that mr beebe you may well wish that he will never forgive usi mean he will never be interested in us again
i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner
i wish he hadntbut if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run perhaps then he said more gently well i acted the truththe only thing i did doand you came back to me
so possibly you know he turned back into the room
nonsense with that sock he carried her to the window so that she too saw all the view
they sank upon their knees invisible from the road they hoped and began to whisper one anothers names
ah
it was worth while it was the great joy that they had expected and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt
they were silent
signorino domani faremo oh bother that man but lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said no dont be rude to him then with a catching of her breath she murmured mr
eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte
how cruel she would be to a man like that look at the lights going over the bridge but this room reminds me of charlotte
how horrible to grow old in charlottes way
to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldnt have heard your father was in the house
for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense
you couldnt have made me
when i am very happyshe kissed himi remember on how little it all hangs
if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever but she did know said george she did see my father surely
he said so oh no she didnt see him
she was upstairs with old mrs beebe dont you remember and then went straight to the church
she said so george was obstinate again
my father said he saw her and i prefer his word
he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett
a few minutes before you came in
she was turning to go as he woke up
he didnt speak to her then they spoke of other thingsthe desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another and whose reward is to rest quietly in each others arms
it was long ere they returned to miss bartlett but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting
george who disliked any darkness said its clear that she knew
then why did she risk the meeting
she knew he was there and yet she went to church they tried to piece the thing together
as they talked an incredible solution came into lucys mind
she rejected it and said how like charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment but something in the dying evening in the roar of the river in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life and george whispered or did she mean it mean what signorino domani faremo uno giro lucy bent forward and said with gentleness lascia prego lascia
siamo sposati scusi tanto signora he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse
buona serae grazie niente the cabman drove away singing
mean what george he whispered is it this
is this possible
ill put a marvel to you
that your cousin has always hoped
that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like thisof course very far down
that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped
i cant explain her any other way
can you
look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable
the sight of us haunted heror she couldnt have described us as she did to her friend
there are detailsit burnt
i read the book afterwards
she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through
she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy
we can never make friends with her or thank her
but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad it is impossible murmured lucy and then remembering the experiences of her own heart she said noit is just possible youth enwrapped them the song of phaethon announced passion requited love attained
but they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this
the song died away they heard the river bearing down the snows of winter into the mediterranean
[Illustration] A Room With A View By E. M. Forster CONTENTS PART ONE Chapter I The Bertolini “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at all.
She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart.
Oh, Lucy!” “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the Signora’s unexpected accent.
“It might be London.” She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A.
Oxon.
), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London?
I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside.
I suppose it is one’s being so tired.” “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno.
The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.
The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!” “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that you shouldn’t have a view.” Lucy felt that she had been selfish.
“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of course, you must look over the Arno, too.
I meant that.
The first vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no.
You must have it.” “I insist on it.
Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.” “She would never forgive _me_.” The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a little peevish.
They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument.
He said: “I have a view, I have a view.” Miss Bartlett was startled.
Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.
She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she glanced at him.
He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes.
There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes.
These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim.
So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A view?
Oh, a view!
How delightful a view is!” “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George.
He has a view too.” “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have yours.
We’ll change.” The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.
Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.” “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.” “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy.
Her cousin again repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted.
“Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son.
“There’s nothing else to say.” He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful.
Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before.
Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change?
What possible objection had she?
They would clear out in half an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality.
It was impossible to snub any one so gross.
Her face reddened with displeasure.
She looked around as much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are genteel.” “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear.
This pension is a failure.
To-morrow we will make a change.” Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness.
Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh!
Why, it’s Mr. Beebe!
Oh, how perfectly lovely!
Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are.
Oh!” Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint: “How do you do, Mr. Beebe?
I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.” The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.
But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
“Just fancy how small the world is.
Summer Street, too, makes it so specially funny.” “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—” “Yes, I heard from mother so last week.
She didn’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr.
Beebe is—’” “Quite right,” said the clergyman.
“I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June.
I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.” “Oh, how glad I am!
The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.” “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.” “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.” He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons.
He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before.
It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field.
“Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded.
“The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.” “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table.
“Mr.
Beebe, you are wrong.
The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.” “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin.
“We are in luck.” And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them.
People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would grow upon them.
The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do.
Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them.
And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato!
They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words.
I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.” The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did.
It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more than cloth.
Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her daughter.
It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.
Was this really Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.
She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle.
“We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.
“The first evening means so much.
When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.” He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?” “Emerson.” “Is he a friend of yours?” “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.” “Then I will say no more.” He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing.
His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.” “You acted very naturally,” said he.
He seemed thoughtful, and after a few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of accepting.” “No _harm_, of course.
But we could not be under an obligation.” “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show gratitude.
He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he means.
He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them.
He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite.
It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.” Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice.” “I think he is; nice and tiresome.
I differ from him on almost every point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores.
When he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up.
He has no tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will not keep his opinions to himself.
We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.” “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?” Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?” “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet.
He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains.
Of course, he has all his father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.” “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett.
“So you think I ought to have accepted their offer?
You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?” “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.” “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?” He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared.
“Why didn’t you talk, Lucy?
He prefers young people, I’m sure.
I do hope I haven’t monopolized him.
I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time.” “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a clergyman.” “My dear Lucia—” “Well, you know what I mean.
And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.” “Funny girl!
How you do remind me of your mother.
I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe.” “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.” “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world.
I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.” “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine.
She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered.
Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.” And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more careful.
It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.” Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat.
Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room.
It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England.
Signora Bertolini is so English.” “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy.
“We dread going to bed.” “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed.
“If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful!
We were so sorry for you at dinner.” “I think he was meaning to be kind.” “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr.
Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature.
Of course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.” “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
No one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know.
No, he is not tactful; yet, have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?” “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.
“Are not beauty and delicacy the same?” “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly.
“But things are so difficult, I sometimes think.” She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms.
I’m so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again.
He has let me come and ask you.
He would be so pleased.” “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious.
I must apologize for my interference.” Gravely displeased, he turned to go.
Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours.
It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only here through your kindness.
If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it.
Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?” She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this.
I do not wish the acceptance to come from you.
Grant me that, at all events.” Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously: “Mr.
Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.” The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally.
But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out.” Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath.
All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first.
Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms!
It is all he can do to keep polite.” “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe.
Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.
“Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part.
Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature.
Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow.
Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said: “I think one might venture now.
No, Lucy, do not stir.
I will superintend the move.” “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear.
It is my affair.” “But I would like to help you.” “No, dear.” Charlotte’s energy!
And her unselfishness!
She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
So Lucy felt, or strove to feel.
And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful.
At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room.
Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.” Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him.
I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.” “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.
It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances.
It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation.
Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle.
Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson.
So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him.
Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.
It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
An electric tram came rushing underneath the window.
No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand.
Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go.
Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.
Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.
The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway.
Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.
So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone.
By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.
Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out?
Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone.
Miss Bartlett could not allow this.
Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin.
Oh, no!
that would never do.
Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person.
Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe.
Italians understand.
A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.
Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.” Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad.
The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.” Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut!
Miss Lucy!
I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He does but touch the surface of things.
As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it.
The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.” This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.
Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno.
How delightfully warm!
But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?
Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante.
San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story.
The men on the river were fishing.
(Untrue; but then, so is most information.)
Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried: “A smell!
a true Florentine smell!
Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.” “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
Buon giorno!
Buon giorno!” bowing right and left.
“Look at that adorable wine-cart!
How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!” So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.
It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno!
Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors.
_That_ is the true democracy.
Though I am a real Radical as well.
There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy.
“We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.” “I see, I see.
And now you have gone over to the enemy.” “Oh, please—!
If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right.
And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.” “Shameful!
A manufacturing district, I suppose?” “No—in the Surrey hills.
About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.” Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well.
It is full of the very nicest people.
Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?” “Very well indeed.” “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?” “Why, she rents a field of us!
How funny!” Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?” “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob.
“Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.” Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
Italy receded.
They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her.
And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed: “Bless us!
Bless us and save us!
We’ve lost the way.” Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window.
But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost!
lost!
My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.
How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do?
Two lone females in an unknown town.
Now, this is what _I_ call an adventure.” Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven!
And no, you are not, not, _not_ to look at your Baedeker.
Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it.
We will simply drift.” Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became discontented herself.
For one ravishing moment Italy appeared.
She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale.
There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven.
Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop, because it looked so typical.
It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown.
But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness.
Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically.
It was Santa Croce.
The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them.
I do detest conventional intercourse.
Nasty!
they are going into the church, too.
Oh, the Britisher abroad!” “We sat opposite them at dinner last night.
They have given us their rooms.
They were so very kind.” “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish.
“They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.
It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.” “What would you ask us?” Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she, at all events, would get full marks.
In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried: “There goes my local-colour box!
I must have a word with him!” And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes.
Then she began to get tired.
The beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places.
She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original.
But at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both gesticulating largely.
Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her Baedeker.
How could she find her way home?
How could she find her way about in Santa Croce?
Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in Florence again.
A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans.
Of course, it must be a wonderful building.
But how like a barn!
And how very cold!
Of course, it contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper.
But who was to tell her which they were?
She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
There was no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she began to be happy.
She puzzled out the Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.
She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed.
Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated.
What could this mean?
They did it again and again.
Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue.
Punishment followed quickly.
The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward.
She was too late.
He fell heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted forward also.
“Hard in life, hard in death.
Go out into the sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
Intolerable bishop!” The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and frightened!
But what else can you expect from a church?” The child’s legs had become as melting wax.
Each time that old Mr. Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar.
Fortunately an Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue.
By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
He stood.
Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson.
“You have done more than all the relics in the world.
I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy.
There is no scheme of the universe—” He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons.
She was determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply.
“But what are you doing here?
Are you doing the church?
Are you through with the church?” “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance.
“I came here with Miss Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.” “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.” “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
“I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded.
It’s worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker.
_That’s_ worth minding.” Lucy was puzzled.
She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where the idea would lead?
She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you.
I really came to help with the child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.” “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say.
You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious.
But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it.
Lucy could not get cross.
Mr. Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him.
On the other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him.
It was at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope.
It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will kindly tell me which they are.” The son nodded.
With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel.
There was a hint of the teacher about him.
She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared.
Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective.
Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true?
How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!” “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort!
Built by faith indeed!
That simply means the workmen weren’t paid properly.
And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
Look at that fat man in blue!
He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.” He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might.
The audience shifted uneasily, and so did Lucy.
She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her.
They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it?
Yes or no?” George replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all.
I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.” “You will never go up,” said his father.
“You and I, dear boy, will lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives.” “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is, going up.
It did happen like that, if it happened at all.” “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice.
“The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.” The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands.
They filed out of the chapel in silence.
Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“There’s plenty of room for us all.
Stop!” The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.” George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is.
I don’t remember.” “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
It’s that Mr.
Eager.
Why did he go?
Did we talk too loud?
How vexatious.
I shall go and say we are sorry.
Hadn’t I better?
Then perhaps he will come back.” “He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
Cuthbert Eager.
Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent.
The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her.
“He will try to be kind.” “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters.
But he is kind to people because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.” “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully—” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain.
Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness.
She saw him once again at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns.
Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only find solution in the night.
The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people.
They won’t come back.” “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy.
“Have you looked at those saints?” “Yes,” said Lucy.
“They are lovely.
Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin?” He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.
There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists.
But Mr. Emerson was only half interested.
He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily.
“I saw nothing in it.” “I like Giotto,” she replied.
“It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values.
Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
A baby is worth a dozen saints.
And my baby’s worth the whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.” Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated.
“He’s unhappy.” “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?
What more is one to give him?
And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God.
With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.” She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one.
She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked.
“He comes out for his holiday to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone.
Eh?
What did you say?” Lucy had made no suggestion.
Suddenly he said: “Now don’t be stupid over this.
I don’t require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me.
He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose?
But let yourself go.
You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night.
Let yourself go.
Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself.
It will be good for both of you.” To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.” “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.” “What things?” “The things of the universe.
It is quite true.
They don’t.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?” In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: “‘From far, from eve and morning, The stuff of life to knit me George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?
We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
But why should this make us unhappy?
Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice.
I don’t believe in this world sorrow.” Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us.
Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.” Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.
A young man melancholy because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried.
“You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then she became matronly.
“Oh, but your son wants employment.
Has he no particular hobby?
Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother.
Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.” The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it.
Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.
Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.
The dear George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd.
He approached, his face in the shadow.
He said: “Miss Bartlett.” “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective.
“Where?
Where?” “In the nave.” “I see.
Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson.
“Poor girl!” She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
“Poor girl?
I fail to understand the point of that remark.
I think myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you.
I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid time.
Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it.
Good-bye.
Thank you both so much for all your kindness.
Ah, yes!
there does come my cousin.
A delightful morning!
Santa Croce is a wonderful church.” She joined her cousin.
Chapter III Music, Violets, and the Letter “S” It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano.
She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected.
The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom.
Lucy had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.
Nor was she the passionate young lady, who performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the pictorial style.
And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory.
Victory of what and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano.
A few people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep.
She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarette-case.
Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it.
It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower.
The seats were filled with a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork.
Among the promised items was “Miss Honeychurch.
Piano.
Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III.
He was in suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends.
With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory.
He was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen.
The audience clapped, no less respectful.
It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners.
I do not consider her choice of a piece happy.
Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs.” “Introduce me.” “She will be delighted.
She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon.” “My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe.
“Why ever did she listen to it?” When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch, disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face.
She loved going to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and meringues.
He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also.
But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him: “If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting both for us and for her.” Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing!
Some one said just the same to mother, and she said she trusted I should never live a duet.” “Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?” “She doesn’t mind it.
But she doesn’t like one to get excited over anything; she thinks I am silly about it.
She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any one’s.
She has never got over it.
Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant—” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality.
She could not complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet.
The whole life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey, and the hills were dirty purple.
Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold, tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and a tickling cough in her throat.
On another day, when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray.
She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe.” “Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy.
This was a stock remark, the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition.
Miss Lavish was so original.
Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness.
For that, and for other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is writing a book?” “They do say so.” “What is it about?” “It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know.” “I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.
We started such friends.
But I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce.
Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.” “The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.” He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish.
They were always in each other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third.
Miss Lavish he believed he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning.
Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells?
All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work.
Girls like Lucy were charming to look at, but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped.
The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore.
But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse.
She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill!
And Mr. Beebe here besides.
Who would suppose this is Italy?
There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.” She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in my room with the door shut.
Doors shut; indeed, most necessary.
No one has the least idea of privacy in this country.
And one person catches it from another.” Lucy answered suitably.
Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.
The Italians are a most unpleasant people.
They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves.
We are at their mercy.
They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires.
From the cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial!
They have no conception of the intellectual life.
How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer over the children’s edjucaishion.
_Hi_ won’t ’ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’” Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way.
Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers.
Indeed, who would have supposed that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last the cause was disclosed.
From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “E.
L.” “That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman.
“A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she’d start a pipe.” “Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.
She took to it, practically in despair, after her life’s work was carried away in a landslip.
Surely that makes it more excusable.” “What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say they nearly always do.
Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink.
She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written.
The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she had an idea.
First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came here—this must on no account get round.
And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.” Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring.
She felt she had made almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.” Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade.
That old Mr. Emerson, who puts things very strangely—” Her jaw dropped.
She was silent.
Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper: “Stomach.
He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind.
I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden.
As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter.
But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought.
She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce.
Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson.
Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ Just imagine!
‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak.
I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking.
I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman!
I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place.
But that was not all.
After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.” “Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I shall go alone.’ She went.
At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.” “Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows.
No one will ever know.
Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.” “Mr.
Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice?
I do so want to know.” Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.
“No; but it is so difficult.
Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him.
Miss Alan, what do you think?
Is he nice?” The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.
Mr. Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying: “I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.” “Violets?
Oh, dear!
Who told you about the violets?
How do things get round?
A pension is a bad place for gossips.
No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce.
Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch!
It really was too bad.
No, I have quite changed.
I do _not_ like the Emersons.
They are _not_ nice.” Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly.
He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed.
He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them.
Miss Lavish, who represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans, who stood for good breeding, were following her.
Miss Bartlett, smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil.
The case of Lucy was different.
She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail.
After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now.
Even their seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once.
Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite politely, of course.” “Most right of her.
They don’t understand our ways.
They must find their level.” Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under.
They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son.
He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them.
It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle.
There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief.
“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said Lucy.
“I want to go round the town in the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say: “I wish we could.
Unluckily I have letters.
If you do want to go out alone, won’t you be better on your feet?” “Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!” But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her from the window, “and she knows it.
I put it down to too much Beethoven.” Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr. Beebe was right.
Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music.
She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan.
Conversation was tedious; she wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram.
This she might not attempt.
It was unladylike.
Why?
Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why.
It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different.
Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much.
But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.
The dragons have gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst.
She reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early Victorian song.
It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas!
the creature grows degenerate.
In her heart also there are springing up strange desires.
She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.
Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are alive.
Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
Nor has she any system of revolt.
Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she had done so.
This afternoon she was peculiarly restive.
She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved.
As she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus, being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it.
(A pity in art of course signified the nude.)
Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it.
She felt a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s “Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni Madonnas.
For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.
She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her to be conscious of it.
“The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to her.
The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it.
Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind.
It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.
An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him, and rest content.
Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.
It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky.
Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.
“Cinque lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest.
He frowned; he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all.
A crowd rose out of the dusk.
It hid this extraordinary man from her, and bore him away to the fountain.
Mr. George Emerson happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where the man had been.
How very odd!
Across something.
Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?” “Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything.
She had complained of dullness, and lo!
one man was stabbed, and another held her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade.
He must have carried her.
He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees.
She repeated: “Oh, what have I done?” “You fainted.” “I—I am very sorry.” “How are you now?” “Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home.
There’s no point in our stopping.” He held out his hand to pull her up.
She pretended not to see it.
The cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily.
The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been!
I might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well.
I can go alone, thank you.” His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?” “I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.
I must have dropped them out there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously.
“Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?” He added to his kindness.
As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!” She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.” “Yes, I am, thank you so very much.” “No, you aren’t.
You’d go openly if you were.” “But I had rather—” “Then I don’t fetch your photographs.” “I had rather be alone.” He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him.
“And don’t move till I come back.” In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in dreams.
The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day, and joined itself to earth.
How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square?
Again the thought occurred to her, “Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man, had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder.
Oddly enough, it was an easy topic.
She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before.
Being strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood.
She rose without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her, she walked firmly enough towards the Arno.
There a cabman signalled to them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police!
Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish.
When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?” He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?” “Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr.
Emerson!” “Well?” “Where are the photographs?” He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.” “I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.
Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood.
There!
I’m glad I’ve told you; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them.” He pointed down-stream.
“They’ve gone.” The river swirled under the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man.
“For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled.
It isn’t exactly that a man has died.” Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.” “Mr.
Emerson—” He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.” They were close to their pension.
She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment.
He did likewise.
There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship.
She moved her elbows before saying: “I have behaved ridiculously.” He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what came over me.” “I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.” “Oh, all right.” “And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?” “I’m afraid I don’t.” “I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?” “Your behaviour?
Oh, yes, all right—all right.” “Thank you so much.
And would you—” She could not carry her request any further.
The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
He had thrown her photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason.
It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man.
He would do her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might even have a high opinion of her.
But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe.
It was useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.
She had been in his arms, and he remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari’s shop.
It was not exactly that a man had died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents do happen, and then one returns to the old life!” “I don’t.” Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.” “But why, Mr. Emerson?
What do you mean?” “I shall want to live, I say.” Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno, whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson.
She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also.
They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.
It might have been most unpleasant.
Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone.
None of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the embankment.
Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure, not that she had encountered it.
This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action.
There were two plans between which she had to choose.
Mr. Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies.
Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?
Charlotte declined for herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.
But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth.
“It’s very kind of Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you.
I had much rather.” “Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.
How abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always!
But now she should alter.
All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the Lung’ Arno.
The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and colour.
Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it.
She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this, too!” Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did.
“Look, Lucia!
Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party.
I feared you would repent you of your choice.” Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.
Yesterday had been a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo.
Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not to re-enter it.
She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately remained.
Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria.
She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance.
For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.
She hailed them briskly.
The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett.
“After your despair of yesterday!
What a fortunate thing!” “Aha!
Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck.
Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?” “I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.” The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless creatures.
I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn’t pry.” She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few calculations in realism.
Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material.
A good deal of it was unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt.
The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note.
For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.” That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?” Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot.
But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish concluded.
“It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline.
There will be a deal of local colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall also introduce some humorous characters.
And let me give you all fair warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.” “Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett.
“I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons.” Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can.
For I repeat and I insist, and I have always held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life.” There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded.
Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett.
“That last remark struck me as so particularly true.
It should be a most pathetic novel.” Lucy assented.
At present her great aim was not to get put into it.
Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,” continued Miss Bartlett slowly.
“None but the superficial would be shocked at her.
We had a long talk yesterday.
She believes in justice and truth and human interest.
She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr.
Eager!
Why, how nice!
What a pleasant surprise!” “Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.” “We were chatting to Miss Lavish.” His brow contracted.
“So I saw.
Were you indeed?
Andate via!
sono occupato!” The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile.
“I am about to venture a suggestion.
Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a drive in the hills?
We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour’s ramble on the hillside.
The view thence of Florence is most beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape.
Decidedly.
But who looks at it to-day?
Ah, the world is too much for us.” Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that Mr.
Eager was no commonplace chaplain.
He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home.
He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent.
Tea at a Renaissance villa?
Nothing had been said about it yet.
But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same.
But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew.
A drive in the hills with Mr.
Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no longer the greatest of them.
She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain.
“In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity.
Andate via!
andate presto, presto!
Ah, the town!
Beautiful as it is, it is the town.” They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies.
To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and humiliating.” “Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened.
She can hardly bear to speak of it.” She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question.
“Do not blame her, please, Mr.
Eager.
The fault is mine: I left her unchaperoned.” “So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable.
His dark, handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.” “One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience.
I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?” Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—” “Were over at the Loggia.” “That must have saved you much.
You have not, of course, seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.” Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal league of Italy with youth.
He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr.
Eager, binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico’s angels.
She tore.
A shrill cry rose from the vendor.
The book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr.
Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a grievance.
His mysterious persecution of Mr.
Eager became relentless; the air rang with his threats and lamentations.
He appealed to Lucy; would not she intercede?
He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on bread.
He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued.
Under the chaplain’s guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy.
She had been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr.
Eager, she knew not why.
And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased to respect them.
She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist.
She doubted that Mr.
Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose.
They were tried by some new test, and they were found wanting.
As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte she was exactly the same.
It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact.
A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press.
I came across him at Brixton.” They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr.
Eager, “one has only sympathy for their success.
The desire for education and for social advance—in these things there is something not wholly vile.
There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as they would make of it.” “Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.” He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.” “Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead.
I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with me.
He was in my London parish long ago.
The other day in Santa Croce, when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him.
Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub.” “What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr.
Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended.
Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity.
Lucy, though she wished never to see the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man?
We know that already.” “Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all.
The boy—an innocent child at the time—I will exclude.
God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him.” “Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not hear.” “To speak plainly,” said Mr.
Eager, “it is.
I will say no more.” For the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the first time in her life.
“You have said very little.” “It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.
He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips.
It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily.
“That man murdered his wife!” “How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.
That day in Santa Croce—did they say anything against me?” “Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.” “Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you.
But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
“They’re nothing to me.” “How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene.
The shopman was possibly listening.
“She will find it difficult.
For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God.” The addition of God was striking.
But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
A silence followed which might have been impressive, but was merely awkward.
Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive.
“Drive?
Oh, is our drive to come off?” Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr.
Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed.
“It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all.
Why should he invite us in that absurd manner?
We might as well invite him.
We are each paying for ourselves.” Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish.” “How?” “Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.” “That will mean another carriage.” “Far worse.
Mr.
Eager does not like Eleanor.
She knows it herself.
The truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.” They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank.
Lucy stood by the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer, or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain.
The well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets?
Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it.
Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck.
She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank.
As she groped she murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr.
Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we must be prepared.
It is you they really want; I am only asked for appearances.
You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will follow behind.
A one-horse carriage would do for us.
Yet how difficult it is!” “It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.” “Oh, dear, Lucy!
I do hope Florence isn’t boring you.
Speak the word, and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.” “Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her mother’s letters could be.
She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway.
She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs.
Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news that interested her least.
“Do you know the Vyses?” “Oh, not that way back.
We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria.” “They’re nice people, the Vyses.
So clever—my idea of what’s really clever.
Don’t you long to be in Rome?” “I die for it!” The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant.
It has no grass, no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick.
By an odd chance—unless we believe in a presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity.
Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before.
Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly.
“Here’s an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel?
For I do know what I want.
I’m sick of Florence.
No, you said you’d go to the ends of the earth!
Do!
Do!” Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied: “Oh, you droll person!
Pray, what would become of your drive in the hills?” They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up the stony hill.
Mr. Beebe recognized him at once.
Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.
And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light.
To her Mr.
Eager objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition.
But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
She did not mind.
Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy.
The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss Lavish.
For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting Mr.
Eager, had doubled the size of the party.
And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus transformed.
Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.
But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr.
Eager, repressive towards Miss Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring.
She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate.
But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully.
In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy.
She had refused, not because she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he did know.
And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia, but by the river.
To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled emotion, but of the whole fabric.
There was really something blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word.
This sense of wickedness had been slight at first.
She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo.
But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again.
And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr.
Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling?
As a student of art?” “Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!” “Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like myself?” “Oh, no.
I am here as a tourist.” “Oh, indeed,” said Mr.
Eager.
“Are you indeed?
If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.
The result is, they mix up towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl.
You know the American girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’ There’s travelling for you.
Ha!
ha!
ha!” “I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit.
“The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.” “Quite so.
Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are here for trade, for example.
But the greater part are students.
Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico.
I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left.
No, you can only see it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall.
She is very proud of that thick hedge.
Inside, perfect seclusion.
One might have gone back six hundred years.
Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?” “It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish.
“Tell me, where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day?” But Mr.
Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr.
Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill.
“Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’?
He is working at Gemistus Pletho.
Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.” During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully.
Lucy had a spasm of envy.
Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.
They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road.
“Piano!
piano!” said Mr.
Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped his horses up again.
Now Mr.
Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or was he one of its manifestations?
The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.
“Piano!
piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.
Phaethon, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was most unpleasant.
The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr.
Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but at its manner.
At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and patted them on the back to signify his approval.
And Miss Lavish, though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried.
“But I dare say I shall receive scant support.
I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life.
This is what _I_ call an adventure.” “We must not submit,” said Mr.
Eager.
“I knew he was trying it on.
He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.” “Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood in no awe.
“Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there?
To be driven by lovers—A king might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I know.” Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect.
Mr.
Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will, was determined to make himself heard.
He addressed the driver again.
Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream, with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker, and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased.
Why should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto.
She pointed at the other carriage.
Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other.
Then Persephone got down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr.
Eager, smiting his hands together as the carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson.
“It is defeat.
You have parted two people who were happy.” Mr.
Eager shut his eyes.
He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but he would not speak to him.
The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took up the matter warmly.
He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money.
He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.
We have no rights over his soul.” Miss Lavish frowned.
It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said.
“He jolted us.” “That I deny.
It was as restful as sleeping.
Aha!
he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder?
He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is justified.
And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl, too.
It doesn’t do to injure young people.
Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici?” Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have.
Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature?” “The Lord knows.
Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go fighting against the Spring.’” Mr.
Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured.
“‘War not with the May’ would render a correct meaning.” “The point is, we have warred with it.
Look.” He pointed to the Val d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them.
Do you suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man?
But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.” No one encouraged him to talk.
Presently Mr.
Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain.
It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before.
He had ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending.
Standing there, he had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work.
But where exactly had he stood?
That was the question which Mr.
Eager hoped to solve now.
And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups.
Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask.
In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio Baldovinetti, but the drive.
Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was very sorry that she had asked him.
She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him.
Mr. Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish.
“Oh, but I shall die!
Of course it was the railway!” She could not control her mirth.
“He is the image of a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.” “Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion.
“Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—” “I can’t stop.
Let me go my wicked way.
A porter—” “Eleanor!” “I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy.
“The Emersons won’t hear, and they wouldn’t mind if they did.” Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly.
“Pouf!
Wouf!
You naughty girl!
Go away!” “Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr.
Eager, I’m sure.” “I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.” “Mr.
Eager will be offended.
It is your party.” “Please, I’d rather stop here with you.” “No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish.
“It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.
Miss Lucy, you are to go.
We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.” The girl was stubborn.
As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.
Such a one was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte.
She wished she had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Oh, I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here.” Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm.
Lucy did not look at the view either.
She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish.
“Observe my foresight.” With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy.
The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
If I do feel it coming on I shall stand.
Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist.
“Here we are, all settled delightfully.
Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown.
Sit down, dear; you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared her throat.
“Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold.
It’s the tiniest cough, and I have had it three days.
It’s nothing to do with sitting here at all.” There was only one way of treating the situation.
At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr.
Eager, vanquished by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.
The miscreant, a bony young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up.
Of course he knew where.
Not so far either.
His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon.
He should just think he did know where.
He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary.
What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good?
Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings!
He showed her his cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?” She was correct as usual.
He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her.
Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.
Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
She thanked him with real pleasure.
In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
For the first time she felt the influence of Spring.
His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?” “Ma buoni uomini.” He bowed.
Certainly.
Good men first, violets afterwards.
They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker.
They were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces.
He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant boughs.
She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.
Not a step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?” There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.
The voice of Mr.
Eager?
He shrugged his shoulders.
An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge.
She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen.
The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
Light and beauty enveloped her.
She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.” She did not answer.
From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view, and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam.
But never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival.
For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.
He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves.
The bushes above them closed.
He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called, “Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.
What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was slow to discover.
Mr.
Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk.
Mr. Emerson, seeking his son, was told whereabouts to find him.
Mr. Beebe, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the return home.
There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment.
Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics.
Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise.
Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett.
Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager.
Mr. Emerson had lost George.
Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square.
Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable.
He climbed on to the box shivering, with his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather.
“Let us go immediately,” he told them.
“The signorino will walk.” “All the way?
He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently.
I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.
He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence.
He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.
He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also.
Not so these English.
They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents, but infinitely the least dangerous.
Once back in the town, he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more.
Of course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it.
But after all, what have we to do with taverns?
Real menace belongs to the drawing-room.
It was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun.
Lucy sat beside her; Mr.
Eager sat opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious.
They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together.
The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol.
There was a lightning flash, and Miss Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front.
At the next flash, Lucy screamed also.
Mr.
Eager addressed her professionally: “Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith.
If I might say so, there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements.
Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?” “No—of course—” “Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous.
The steel knives, the only articles which might attract the current, are in the other carriage.
And, in any case, we are infinitely safer than if we were walking.
Courage—courage and faith.” Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand.
At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles, gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr.
Eager!” called Mr. Beebe.
“We want your assistance.
Will you interpret for us?” “George!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way.
He may be killed.” “Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver is no help.
Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.” “He may be killed!” cried the old man.
“He may be killed!” “Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage.
“In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.” “What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr.
Eager know?” “Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing.
But—” she pointed at the driver—“_he_ knows everything.
Dearest, had we better?
Shall I?” She took out her purse.
“It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book, she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it.
As well this ending to his day as any.
But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road.
The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen.
If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt.
They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.
They descended from the carriages; they embraced each other.
It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them.
For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly.
In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike.
Miss Lavish calculated that, even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the accident.
Mr.
Eager mumbled a temperate prayer.
But the drivers, through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me.
Kiss me again.
Only you can understand me.
You warned me to be careful.
And I—I thought I was developing.” “Do not cry, dearest.
Take your time.” “I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse.
Once by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?” The thought disturbed her repentance.
As a matter of fact, the storm was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not.
One would always pray against that.” “He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that.
I simply slipped into those violets.
No, I want to be really truthful.
I am a little to blame.
I had silly thoughts.
The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.” “In a book?” “Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.” “And then?” “But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
Indeed, she had little more to learn.
With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her.
All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
“It is so hard to be absolutely truthful.” “Don’t be troubled, dearest.
Wait till you are calmer.
We will talk it over before bed-time in my room.” So they re-entered the city with hands clasped.
It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others.
The storm had ceased, and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son.
Mr. Beebe had regained good humour, and Mr.
Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish.
Charlotte alone she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening.
She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it.
All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be carefully laid before her cousin.
And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself.
I shan’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know what.” Miss Alan asked her to play.
She refused vehemently.
Music seemed to her the employment of a child.
She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own.
Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay.
In vain she tried to check, or at all events to accelerate, the tale.
It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach: “Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire.
Come into my room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.” With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the girl.
Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?” She was unprepared for the question.
It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything.
A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done?
A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.” The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door.
A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes.
She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?” “The driver?” “My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.” Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?” “I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.” “I, too, intend to judge him charitably.
But unfortunately I have met the type before.
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first?
Come here and listen to me.
I am only gathering it from his own remarks.
Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another?” “Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude.
There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish.
But we are no farther on with our question.
What do you propose to do?” An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it.
But—as you said—it is my affair.
Mine and his.” “And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?” “Certainly not.
There would be no difficulty.
Whatever you ask him he answers, yes or no; then it is over.
I have been frightened of him.
But now I am not one little bit.” “But we fear him for you, dear.
You are so young and inexperienced, you have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round.
This afternoon, for example, if I had not arrived, what would have happened?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?” “I hadn’t time to think.
You came.” “Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?” “I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off.
She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett.
“You will be seen from the road.” Lucy obeyed.
She was in her cousin’s power.
She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started.
Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man!
We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless.
There is Mr.
Eager, but you do not trust him.
Oh, for your brother!
He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.
Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead.
There are still left some men who can reverence woman.” As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and ranged them upon the pin cushion.
Then she blew into her gloves and said: “It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.” “What train?” “The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?” “At eight.” “Signora Bertolini would be upset.” “We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.” “I expect she will.
However, we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses’ hotel.
Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?” “Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained motionless and silent.
To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome.
Lucy, when admonished, began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte, who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly.
She knelt down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.
But she was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her, but needed her to love.
For it was in ominous tones that she said, after a long pause: “Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?” Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant.
Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: “Charlotte dear, what do you mean?
As if I have anything to forgive!” “You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
I know well how much I vex you at every turn.” “But no—” Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged martyr.
“Ah, but yes!
I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped.
I might have known it would not do.
You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you.
I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.” “Please—” “My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and were often able to leave me at home.
I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary.
You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.” “You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other, heart and soul.
They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own.
“Failed to make you happy; failed in my duty to your mother.
She has been so generous to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.” “But mother will understand.
It is not your fault, this trouble, and it isn’t a disaster either.” “It is my fault, it is a disaster.
She will never forgive me, and rightly.
For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish?” “Every right.” “When I was here for your sake?
If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you.
Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.” Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence.
There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.” The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her.
But in case she should blame you in any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to.
I will never speak of it either to her or to any one.” Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.
Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background.
George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually.
At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since, it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent.
She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed, for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love.
Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters.
Before she reached them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle.
Thus it was that, though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers.
She was still dressed.
It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved.
At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said: “I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.” Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr. Emerson.” His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true.
It can’t all be true.
I want not to be muddled.
I want to grow older quickly.” Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear.
You need all the rest you can get.” In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun.
They were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied.
A poet—none was present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room.
One—a boy of nineteen—was studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano.
From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him what she had written.
And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother.
“I tell you I’m getting fairly sick.” “For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
“Time they did.” “I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.” “It’s his third go, isn’t it?” “Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.” “I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy.
I don’t know how girls manage things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.” “Do you indeed, dear?
How interesting!” “I feel—never mind.” He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse.
I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’” “Yes, mother, you told me.
A jolly good letter.” “I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.
But—’” She stopped reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all.
He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth.
When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.” “Nor me.” “You?” Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?” “He asked me for my permission also.” She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir.
“Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?
What ever did you say?” “I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’” “What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come.
There they still are!” “I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.” “Peeping like that!
Can’t I look out of my own window?” But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves.
For a brief space they were silent.
Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave a nervous gulp.
“Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy.
He practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her?
And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.” “I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.” “I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth.
“There!
Fly into a stew!
I can’t help it—had to say it.
I had to say no.
He ought never to have asked me.” “Ridiculous child!” cried his mother.
“You think you’re so holy and truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit.
Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say?
I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?” “Oh, do keep quiet, mother!
I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.
I tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right.
But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.” “No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the subject, “I shall not keep quiet.
You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.” “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
“I only let out I didn’t like him.
I don’t hate him, but I don’t like him.
What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.” He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“I know his mother; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick the piano!
He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained dissatisfied.
She added: “And he has beautiful manners.” “I liked him till just now.
I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.” “Mr.
Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest.
“I don’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in.” “You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means.
He said: ‘Mr.
Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he meant.
He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking.
Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.” “You never can, dear.
But I can.
You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.” The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it.
But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust.
Cecil praised one too much for being athletic.
Was that it?
Cecil made one talk in one’s own way.
This tired one.
Was that it?
And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow’s cap.
Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself.
He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother.
“‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light.
She keeps that flat abominably—” “Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?” “Don’t interrupt so foolishly.
Where was I?
Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing.
I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything.
But I do not know—’” “Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation.
He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles.
Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds.
But it was transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald.
Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described.
He was medieval.
Like a Gothic statue.
Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism.
A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant.
And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!” “I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals.
They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.
We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the furniture.
“This is indeed a joyous day!
I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy.” “I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat.
She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis.
Then she saw her brother’s face.
Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?” Cecil suggested.
“And I’d stop here and tell my mother.” “We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.” They passed into the sunlight.
Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and descend out of sight by the steps.
They would descend—he knew their ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed, until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical.
He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s.
That day she had seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel.
But Italy worked some marvel in her.
It gave her light, and—which he held more precious—it gave her shadow.
Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence.
She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness.
Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other.
It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the same to him as before.
Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language.
She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her.
He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
The things that really mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy.
His mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he moved to the writing table.
There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many erasures.
He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.
With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table.
The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter.
He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about it none the less.
It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected.
“I represent all that he despises.
Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?” The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
“Mr.
Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse.
Do you suppose that I shall get it?” “I should say so.
Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.” “Pfui!” “I know,” said Cecil.
“I know.
I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.” For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip.
Isn’t this news?” “News?
I don’t understand you,” said Cecil.
“News?” Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field.
He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!” “Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself.
Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen!
Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
But his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question!
To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church!
I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.” “I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly.
“I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board.
Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the right names.
I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery.
It is very remiss of me.
Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.” Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?” “I have no profession,” said Cecil.
“It is another example of my decadence.
My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
I know I ought to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.” “You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe.
“It is a wonderful opportunity, the possession of leisure.” His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally.
He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve.
I daren’t face the healthy person—for example, Freddy Honeychurch.” “Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?” “Admirable.
The sort who has made England what she is.” Cecil wondered at himself.
Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly contrary?
He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea before evening service.” “I suppose Anne never told them you were here.
In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives.
The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?” “I know the faults of Mary.
She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.” “The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small.” They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many.
No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.” “She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree.
At present she has none.” “At present?” “I’m not cynical.
I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle.
Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.” Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?” “Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps.
Oh, I forgot; of course, you knew her before.
No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.” “In what way?” Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string.
Picture number two: the string breaks.” The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically.
At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?” “No.
I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.” “It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst.
He cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken?
What do you mean?” “I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.” The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize.
I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners.
Was this the reception his action would get from the world?
Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly.
“I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.” “Not that.
But you ought to have stopped me.
I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes.
Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with any one; certainly not with you.” “You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?” Mr. Beebe pulled himself together.
Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions.
He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet.
I foresaw at Florence that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended.
I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio.
He did not omit to do so.
“She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her.” “Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?” Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march.
Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried.
He looked at Lucy.
In her presence he could not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.
I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great and small.
I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and mother.
And now I want my tea.” “You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted.
“How dare you be serious at Windy Corner?” He took his tone from her.
There was no more heavy beneficence, no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures.
None of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe.
Away from it, in the solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical.
But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious.
It has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart.
The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed.
Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel sentimental.
Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.
If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true.
Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them greatly.
They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door.
Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance.
Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as a mother-in-law.
As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him.
People congratulated Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid.
They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with the dowagers.
When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?” “I suppose so.
Mother, would it be?” “Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and said: “To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.” “I am so sorry that you were stranded.” “Not that, but the congratulations.
It is so disgusting, the way an engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment.
All those old women smirking!” “One has to go through it, I suppose.
They won’t notice us so much next time.” “But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong.
An engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and should be treated as such.” Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially correct.
The spirit of the generations had smiled through them, rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth.
To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite different—personal love.
Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said.
“Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?” “I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public.
The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic.
Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato.” “Inglese Italianato?” “E un diavolo incarnato!
You know the proverb?” She did not.
Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother.
But Cecil, since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.” “We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?” “It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in, or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?” She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert.
“I don’t see any difference.
Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same place.” “We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap.
“This is me.
That’s Windy Corner.
The rest of the pattern is the other people.
Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.” She leant placidly back.
Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and that’s Mr. Beebe.” “A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.” Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect what they meant.
She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried.
“I consider him far above the average.
I only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful ones, is Mr.
Eager, the English chaplain at Florence.
He was truly insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate.
He was a snob, and so conceited, and he did say such unkind things.” “What sort of things?” “There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife.” “Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing.
Mr.
Eager would never come to the point.
He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.” “Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander?
It was, I believe, chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped.
People pretended he was vulgar, but he certainly wasn’t that.” “Poor old man!
What was his name?” “Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr.
Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know.
I hate him.
I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto.
I hate him.
Nothing can hide a petty nature.
I _hate_ him.” “My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“You’ll blow my head off!
Whatever is there to shout over?
I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen.” He smiled.
There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s moral outburst over Mr.
Eager.
It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine.
He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not in muscular rant.
But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive.
After a moment, he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval.
He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.
He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.
The outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact.
Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I feel I could never live out of it.
When I’m in the country I feel the same about the country.
After all, I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who live amongst them must be the best.
It’s true that in nine cases out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything.
The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions.
Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town.
Do you feel that, Mrs. Honeychurch?” Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled.
She had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either.
Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics.
It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?” “‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?” “Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled spire.
Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church.
In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages.
Some great mansions were at hand, but they were hidden in the trees.
The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement, having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals.
“Albert” was inhabited.
His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace.
“Cissie” was to let.
Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically.
“Summer Street will never be the same again.” As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry.
Now we shall know.
Sir Harry, pull those things down at once!” Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I meant to.
I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss Flack.” “Am I not always right?
She ought to have gone before the contract was signed.
Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s time?” “But what can I do?” He lowered his voice.
“An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden.” “Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully.
He had had full warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory.
He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt.
Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper.
He ventured to differ, however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration.
Sir Harry hinted that a column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin.
He built his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage.
He had failed in his duties to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy landlord.
But it is such an awkward size.
It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.” Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them.
The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously.
“It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.” “Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly.
“That is exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong type of people.
The train service has improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind.
And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?” “Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate.
She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea.
How would you like spinsters?” “My dear Lucy, it would be splendid.
Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.
I heard from them last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.
I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people.
Mr. Beebe knows them, too.
May I tell them to write to you?” “Indeed you may!” he cried.
“Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
How delightful it is!
Extra facilities—please tell them they shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees.
Oh, the agents!
The appalling people they have sent me!
One woman, when I wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance.
As if one cares about that!
And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable.
And oh, the deceit!
I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week.
The deceit of the most promising people.
My dear Lucy, the deceit!” She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all.
I know the type.
Preserve me from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy.
It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down.” “I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very sad thing.” “The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil.
“I haven’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.” “Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.” “It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied.
“I oughtn’t to come with my troubles to young people.
But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no real help.” “Then may I write to my Misses Alan?” “Please!” But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed: “Beware!
They are certain to have canaries.
Sir Harry, beware of canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come.
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.” “Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
If they get drunk, there’s an end of them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off.
If they’re vulgar, they somehow keep it to themselves.
It doesn’t spread so.
Give me a man—of course, provided he’s clean.” Sir Harry blushed.
Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex.
Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction.
He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself.
She was delighted.
Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house.
Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?” “Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.
He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha!
young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!” “I can’t help it.
It would be wrong not to loathe that man.” “He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.” “No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life.
In London he would keep his place.
He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife would give brainless dinner parties.
But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and every one—even your mother—is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt discouraged.
“I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.” “It matters supremely.
Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!
How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
with his bald head and retreating chin!
But let’s forget him.” This Lucy was glad enough to do.
If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape?
For instance, Freddy.
Freddy was neither clever, nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”?
And what would she reply?
Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety enough.
She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps, during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them.
Summer Street lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
“Why is it, Lucy, that you always say the road?
Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?” “Haven’t I?
The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with me in a room.” “A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes.
Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road.
Never in the real country like this.” “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
I have never felt anything of the sort.
You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.” “I don’t know that you aren’t.
I connect you with a view—a certain type of view.
Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?” She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing: “Do you know that you’re right?
I do.
I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room.
How funny!” To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray?
With no view?” “Yes, with no view, I fancy.
Why not?” “I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open air.” She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?” As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees.
She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!” “Why do you call it that?” “I can’t remember why.
I suppose it comes out of some book.
It’s only a puddle now, but you see that stream going through it?
Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful.
Then Freddy used to bathe there.
He is very fond of it.” “And you?” He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed here, too, till I was found out.
Then there was a row.” At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of prudishness within him.
But now?
with his momentary cult of the fresh air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity.
He looked at her as she stood by the pool’s edge.
She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?” “Charlotte,” she murmured.
“She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.” “Poor girl!” She smiled gravely.
A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
“What, Cecil?” “Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me—” He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed.
His courage had gone.
“Yes?” “Up to now I have never kissed you.” She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?” “Of course, you may, Cecil.
You might before.
I can’t run at you, you know.” At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities.
Her reply was inadequate.
She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil.
As he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them.
Such was the embrace.
He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure.
Passion should believe itself irresistible.
It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young man behind the counter would have done?
He recast the scene.
Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness.
For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation.
He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts.
At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.” “What name?” “The old man’s.” “What old man?” “That old man I told you about.
The one Mr.
Eager was so unkind to.” He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had.
Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to.
Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself.
Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs.
Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy.
He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility.
“I cannot think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter.
When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.
The best obtainable.
Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles.
A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia.
Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes.
In this circle, one thought, married, and died.
Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills.
But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high.
You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you.
She returned with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation.
He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad.
He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
Nor did he realize a more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her.
A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved.
For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.” “But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe.
“I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably.
They are coming.
I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried.
“Just because they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing.
And poor Lucy—serve her right—worn to a shadow.” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court.
Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn.
When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring.
“If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count.
I told you not Saturn.” “Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.” “Saturn doesn’t bounce.” “Saturn bounces enough.” “No, he doesn’t.” “Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.” “Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in.
That’s right, Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over the shins!” Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness.
Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt.
He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
But he hated the physical violence of the young.
How right it was!
Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.” “That wasn’t the name—” Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.” “Nonsense, Freddy!
You know nothing about it.” “Nonsense yourself!
I’ve this minute seen him.
He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem!
ahem!
I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’ and slapped him on the back.” “Exactly.
The Miss Alans?” “Rather not.
More like Anderson.” “Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed.
“Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right?
I _said_ don’t interfere with Cissie Villa.
I’m always right.
I’m quite uneasy at being always right so often.” “It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s.
Freddy doesn’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.” “Yes, I do.
I’ve got it.
Emerson.” “What name?” “Emerson.
I’ll bet you anything you like.” “What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly.
“I wish I had never bothered over it at all.” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky.
Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy?
Do you know what Emersons they are?” “I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was democratic.
Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person.
All right, Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother’s a snob.
But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s affectation to pretend there isn’t.” “Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways.
Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man.
Pray, does that satisfy you?” “Oh, yes,” he grumbled.
“And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety.” “_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly.
“Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.” “But has Cecil—” “Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’” She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much.
While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl.
She might well “screech” when she heard that it came partly from her lover.
Mr. Vyse was a tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people.
The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
He diverted it as follows: “The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean?
No, I don’t suppose it will prove to be them.
It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse’s.
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people!
The queerest people!
For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets.
They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa.
Poor little ladies!
So shocked and so pleased.
It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories.
‘My dear sister loves flowers,’ it began.
They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult.
Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets.” “Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister’s face was very red.
She could not recover herself.
Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature—pessimism, et cetera.
Our special joy was the father—such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.
He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Lucy, don’t desert us—go on playing bumble-puppy.
Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place.
That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being there.
Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop?
By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time.” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer.
He suggested that his hostess was mistaken.
At the hint of opposition she warmed.
She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told.
The name escaped her.
What was the name?
Oh, what was the name?
She clasped her knees for the name.
Something in Thackeray.
She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely.
“Don’t be silly.
You always overdo it when you play.” As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
Hitherto truth had come to her naturally.
She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely truthful?
Well, at all events, she must not tell lies.
She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame.
A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.
“Cecil!” “Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window.
He seemed in high spirits.
“I was hoping you’d come.
I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse.
George Meredith’s right—the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa.
Don’t be angry!
Don’t be angry!
You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.” He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said.
“Freddy has told us.
Naughty Cecil!
I suppose I must forgive you.
Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have nice friends of yours.
But you oughtn’t to tease one so.” “Friends of mine?” he laughed.
“But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was.
“Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week.” “What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously.
“I don’t quite understand.” “In the Umbrian Room.
Absolute strangers.
They were admiring Luca Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly.
However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not a little.
They had been to Italy.” “But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends.
I thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—” “Cecil!
No, it’s not fair.
I’ve probably met them before—” He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair.
Anything is fair that punishes a snob.
That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good.
Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with me.
There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things.
I believe in democracy—” “No, you don’t,” she snapped.
“You don’t know what the word means.” He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque.
“No, you don’t!” Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil.
I blame you—I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous.
You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense?
I consider it most disloyal of you.” She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness.
As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded.
He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally.
He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent.
In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse.
His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch.
Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement, met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned.
The Miss Alans were duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held responsible for the failure.
Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived.
Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood.
And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood.
Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood.
But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done.
She was glad that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative.
He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy.
At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do!
I don’t know what I should do without you.” Several days passed.
Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett.
A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not corresponded since they parted in August.
The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased amazingly.
For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical.
Charlotte, unselfish in the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue their tour.
Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs.
Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly.
Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS, “_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA, “I have news of you at last!
Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome.
Puncturing her tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out.
He said his father had just taken the house.
He _said_ he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (?).
He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea.
Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him to enter the house, etc.
That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you have told them already.
Mr. Vyse is so sensitive.
I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome.
I am very sorry about it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me, “Your anxious and loving cousin, “CHARLOTTE.” Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows: “BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE, “Many thanks for your warning.
When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she would blame you for not being always with me.
I have kept that promise, and cannot possibly tell her now.
I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself.
She should have tried at the Rectory.
I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage.
You must see that it would be too absurd.
If the Emersons heard I had complained of them, they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they are not.
I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy Corner at all, but here.
Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your envelope again.
No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately, “L.
M. HONEYCHURCH.” Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not.
Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at?
Miss Bartlett suggested the former.
Perhaps she was right.
It had become a great thing now.
Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago.
She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school.
But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.
It did her no harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors.
The weather was cool, and it did her no harm.
In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people.
The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.
One was tired of everything, it seemed.
One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter.
In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann.
“Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the querulous beauty of the music had died.
She shook her head and played Schumann again.
The melody rose, unprofitably magical.
It broke; it was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave.
The sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of the audience throb.
Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s, had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among many people.
The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.” “Her music always was wonderful.” “Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean.
She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.” “Italy has done it.” “Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her.
“It is just possible.
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.” “But her music!” he exclaimed.
“The style of her!
How she kept to Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schumann was right for this evening.
Schumann was the thing.
Do you know, mother, I shall have our children educated just like Lucy.
Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then—not till then—let them come to London.
I don’t believe in these London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.” “Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s room.
Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself.
She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.” “Bad dreams?” “Just dreams.” The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You should have heard us talking about you, dear.
He admires you more than ever.
Dream of that.” Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed.
Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed.
As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.” “M’m.” “They might amuse you.” Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe.
“They are worth it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
“Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!” “I’ve brought someone to see you.” “I’ll be down in a minute.” The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered.
“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment.
What have they got?
Byron.
Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad.
Never heard of it.
The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it.
Gibbon.
Hullo!
dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.” “Mr.
Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.” “I know.
Isn’t it jolly?
I like that.
I’m certain that’s the old man’s doing.” “How very odd of him!” “Surely you agree?” But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.” “The same as Lucy’s got.” “Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?” “She came back yesterday.” “I suppose she had a good time?” “Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book.
“She and Cecil are thicker than ever.” “That’s good hearing.” “I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.” Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks.
She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books.
Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
Cecil says—” “What on earth are those people doing upstairs?
Emerson—we think we’ll come another time.” George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.” Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face wanted washing.
At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe.” “Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do?
how d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard.
But I’m afraid it will only act between men.
Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How do you do?
Come and have a bathe’?
And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.” “I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.
I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.” “We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you place in the past, is really yet to come.
We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.” Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead.
We despise the body less than women do.
But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.” “I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once.
But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
It is our heritage.” “Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.” “How do you do?
Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty.
I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He has been most kind.
He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
Ah, this wind!
You do well to bathe.
Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!” “Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy.
“I must—that is to say, I have to—have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.” “_Call_, my lad?
Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
Call on your grandmother!
Listen to the wind among the pines!
Yours is a glorious country.” Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr.
Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval.
It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, George.
Why do you dawdle talking?
Bring them back to tea.
Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his office.
I can’t believe he’s well.” George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him.
“It is only a pond, don’t you know.
I dare say you are used to something better.” “Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.” Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
How glorious it was!
For a little time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
He spoke of Florence.
George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse!
Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?” “I did not.
Miss Lavish told me.” “When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of Coincidence.’” No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.” To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is.
I have reflected.
It is Fate.
Everything is Fate.
We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart.
The twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—” “You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman.
“Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
Don’t say, ‘I didn’t do this,’ for you did it, ten to one.
Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?” “Italy.” “And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?” “National Gallery.” “Looking at Italian art.
There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.” “It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George.
“But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.” Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is still to write.” Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that you have come.” Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond.
I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe.
“No apologies are necessary for the pond.” George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid?
I love willow-herb in seed.
What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
Very charming, very charming.” “Mr.
Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George.
Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
It was necessary to use his muscles.
It was necessary to keep clean.
Mr. Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful, water’s simply ripping.” “Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful.
Mr. Beebe, do.” “Apooshoo, kouf.” Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
How glorious it was!
The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Götterdämmerung.
But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
They began to play.
Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
A little deferentially, they splashed George.
He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: “No.
We are what matters.
Without us shall no enterprise begin.
To us shall all flesh turn in the end.” “A try!
A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a kick.
“Goal!” “Goal!” “Pass!” “Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat!
No, that’s enough, Freddy.
Dress now.
No, I say!” But the two young men were delirious.
Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
“Hi!
Steady on!
I see people coming you fellows!” Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi!
hi!
_Ladies!_” Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
Still, they did not hear Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Whoever were those unfortunate people?
Oh, dears, look away!
And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?” “Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
Cecil, Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—” No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently “minded.” “I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.” “This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.” They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
“I can’t be trodden on, can I?” “Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you!
What miserable management!
Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?” “Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and if another fellow—” “Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
Come, Lucy.” They turned.
“Oh, look—don’t look!
Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
How unfortunate again—” For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken.
“I’ve swallowed a pollywog.
It wriggleth in my tummy.
I shall die—Emerson you beast, you’ve got on my bags.” “Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
“And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.” “Mother, do come away,” said Lucy.
“Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.” “Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed.
Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called: “Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
Hullo!” “Bow, Lucy; better bow.
Whoever is it?
I shall bow.” Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away.
On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for youth.
Chapter XIII How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview!
But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume.
Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent.
She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life.
A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much.
“I will bow,” she had thought.
“I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom?
To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.
It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.
Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and he did not want to be seen.
He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside.
He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done.
Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock.
Miss Bartlett, indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory.
Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with Cecil?” The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.” “Perhaps he’s tired.” Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.” “I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.” “Cecil has told you to think so.
You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.” “Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?” “Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?” “Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble ahead.
“It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him sometimes seem—” “Oh, rubbish!
If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother!
I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!” “Not in that way.
At times I could wring her neck.
But not in that way.
No.
It is the same with Cecil all over.” “By-the-by—I never told you.
I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London.” This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me.
No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.” “I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to.
But he does not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.” “Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?” “You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.” “Then why didn’t he leave the room?
Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone’s pleasure?” “We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy.
Something had enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form.
The two civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes.
Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he had succeeded.
And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother—” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
Go.” She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window.
It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.
Now, as in the winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes.
One connected the landing window with depression.
No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly.
And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.
She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.” “My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been!
You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public.
It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else.
Do be more careful.
You forget the place is growing half suburban.” “I say, is anything on to-morrow week?” “Not that I know of.” “Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.” “Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.” “What’s wrong with the court?
They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered new balls.” “I meant _it’s_ better not.
I really mean it.” He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper.
Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans.
Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making!
I have something to say to you.
Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes.
I really can’t stop.
I must dress too.” “How’s Charlotte?” “All right.” “Lucy!” The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?” “Her _what?_” “Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?” “I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly.
“I shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.” Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out.
She did not.
She said: “Come here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life.
It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil.
Cecil despised their methods—perhaps rightly.
At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven.
Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
Then Freddy said: “Lucy, what’s Emerson like?” “I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?” “Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.” “He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly.
I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.” “Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter.” “One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie.
“Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.” “Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.” “She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily.
The remark was a happy one, for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print.
Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath.
But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness.
There were too many ghosts about.
The original ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr.
Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes.
It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s.
How is she?” “I tore the thing up.” “Didn’t she say how she was?
How does she sound?
Cheerful?” “Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.” “Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler.
I know myself how water preys upon one’s mind.
I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the meat.” Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish.
I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long.” It was more than her nerves could stand.
And she could not protest violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded.
“It’s impossible.
We can’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is.
Freddy’s got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare.
It simply can’t be done.” “Nonsense!
It can.” “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
Not otherwise.” “Minnie can sleep with you.” “I won’t have her.” “Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.” “Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy.
“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.” “No, I don’t.
And no more does Cecil.
She gets on our nerves.
You haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good.
So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come.” “Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two.
You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers.
You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.” Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike,” put in Freddy.
“She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.” “I know, dear.
She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return.” But Lucy hardened her heart.
It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She had tried herself too often and too recently.
One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth.
She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother.
I don’t like Charlotte.
I admit it’s horrid of me.” “From your own account, you told her as much.” “Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
She flurried—” The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the places she had known as a child.
The Sacred Lake would never be the same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner.
How would she fight against ghosts?
For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care for eggs.
I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.” Cecil frowned again.
Oh, these Honeychurches!
Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact.
“May me and Lucy get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.” Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room—something with no view, anything.
Her love to Lucy.
And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
She never gazed inwards.
If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
She was nervous at night.
When she talked to George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
Once she had suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious.
Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
She loved Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
Standing between Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his crudities in time.
I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.” Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits.
He laughs more.” “Yes,” replied the clergyman.
“He is waking up.” That was all.
But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs. Honeychurch drove to meet her.
She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“I have upset everything.
Bursting in on young people!
But I insist on paying for my cab up.
Grant that, at any rate.” “Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.” “I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather.
Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.” Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
Only sovereigns and pennies.
Could any one give her change?
Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But who am I to give the sovereign to?” “Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.” Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid.
A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
I should practically be robbing the one who lost.” “Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil.
“So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.” “Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
“How is that, Mr. Vyse?” “Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab.
Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.” Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy.
He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
“I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid.” “Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.” “But I don’t see—” They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you.
I’m done.
I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me.
Ow!
What about Mr. Floyd’s ten shillings?
Ow!
No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.” “I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
“Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
A shilling was it?
Can any one give me change for half a crown?” “I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign.
No, give me up that sovereign.
I’ll get Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning.” “Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?” “No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
“Let me see—a sovereign’s worth of silver.” She escaped into the kitchen.
Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were too uncanny.
It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t.
Here is your money—all shillings, except two half-crowns.
Would you count it?
You can settle your debt nicely now.” Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source.” “Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle.
“George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?” Miss Bartlett considered.
“For instance, the driver.
I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.” Lucy shuddered a little.
“We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren’t careful.
How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?” “We must think of every possibility.” “Oh, it’s all right.” “Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows.
In fact, he is certain to know.” “I don’t care if he does.
I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.” “To contradict it?” “No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best.
Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
Ladies are certainly different.” “Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully.
“You kind, anxious thing.
What _would_ you have me do?
First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say, ‘Tell’.
Which is it to be?
Quick!” Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest.
I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
You will never forgive me.” “Shall we go out, then.
They will smash all the china if we don’t.” For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again.
Have you seen the young one yet?” “Yes, I have.” “What happened?” “We met at the Rectory.” “What line is he taking up?” “No line.
He talked about Italy, like any other person.
It is really all right.
What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way.
He really won’t be any nuisance, Charlotte.” “Once a cad, always a cad.
That is my poor opinion.” Lucy paused.
“Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
It was a new one from Smith’s library.
Her mother must have returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
I don’t think we ought to blame him very much.
It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
He has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into tears.
He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big railways—not a porter!
and runs down to his father for week-ends.
Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
There!
Now for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm.
“Suppose we don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.” Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
Explanations took place, and in the midst of them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain.
Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most of the days of that year.
In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold.
Up on the heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.
Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path.
From the house came incoherent sounds, as of females preparing for worship.
“The men say they won’t go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her, no nonsense”—“Anne!
Mary!
Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine.
Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously.
The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender shadow.
But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window.
Her new cerise dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan.
At her throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an engagement ring.
Her eyes are bent to the Weald.
She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.
In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills.
“Lucy!
Lucy!
What’s that book?
Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?” “It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.” “But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.” Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a Loggia.
She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up.
It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil had said, “What!
you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?” She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.
I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child?
Minnie!
That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!)
Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late.
Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse, never the carriage.
“Where’s Charlotte?
Run up and hurry her.
Why is she so long?
She had nothing to do.
She never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses!
Minnie!” Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting.
As usual, she didn’t see why.
Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men?
The young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words.
Mrs. Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but sovereigns and half crowns.
Could any one give me—” “Yes, easily.
Jump in.
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock!
You put us all to shame.” “If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully.
She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse.
The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
“Good-bye!
Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering.
On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation.
He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.
All that he said on this subject pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church.
There was a line of carriages down the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa.
To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother.
“Unless the young man considers that he knows me already.” He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally.
Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how glad he was that she was going to be married.
She said yes, she was glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice; she had never known him offended before.
He added: “We find, though, that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing.
I am very much upset about it.” “I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,” said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further.
“He thought we should be artistic.
He is disappointed.” “And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up.
What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly.
She must avoid censuring Cecil.
For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned, though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says.
He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall.
Yet it does seem so unkind.” “There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“That’s exactly what I say.
Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?” “There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,” he continued in measured tones.
“We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.
Choose a place where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!” “Eh—?” “I see you’re going to be clever.
I hope you didn’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy.” George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
“He behaved that way to me.
It is his philosophy.
Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first.” “What _do_ you mean?
No, never mind what you mean.
Don’t explain.
He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
Do you play tennis?
Do you mind tennis on Sunday—?” “George mind tennis on Sunday!
George, after his education, distinguish between Sunday—” “Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.
No more do I. That’s settled.
Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased.” He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans.” “I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck.
The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the morning sun?
She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.” “Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady.
Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow.
It was the pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow.
Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered.
He said: “I—I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house.
Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them.
“George has been in such good spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.” Lucy caught her cousin’s eye.
Something in its mute appeal made her reckless.
“Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven.
Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy.
All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things.
It was not an exploit.
He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her hand to her cheek.
“He does not love me.
No.
How terrible if he did!
But he has not told.
He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right.
It’s a secret between us two for ever.
Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room.
The secret, big or little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world.
Thus she interpreted her joy.
She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so safe.
As he helped her out of the carriage, she said: “The Emersons have been so nice.
George Emerson has improved enormously.” “How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them, and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth.
For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected.
He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are.
George Emerson is coming up this afternoon.
He is a most interesting man to talk to.
Only don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks.
Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal.
Generally Lucy was depressed at meals.
Some one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will not last, this cheerfulness.
In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee.
Her mother would always sit there, her brother here.
The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would never be hidden behind the western hills.
After luncheon they asked her to play.
She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.
Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.” She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round.
There George was.
He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
Cecil should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson.
Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.
She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano.
“I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.” “Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil.
“I will not spoil the set.” He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil.
I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s Emerson.” George corrected him: “I am not bad.” One looked down one’s nose at this.
“Then certainly I won’t play,” said Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse.
You had much better not play.
Much better not.” Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would play.
“I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall back on Lucy.
There is no other way out of it.
Lucy, go and change your frock.” Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature.
She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon.
As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner.
She liked music, but how much better tennis seemed.
How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms.
Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child.
George served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
The hills stood out above its radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara.
She might be forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her.
He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others.
He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke.
When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.” “What fun, Cecil!
Read away.
Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!” “Do you mind being beaten?” She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a splendid player, though.
The light was behind you, and it was in my eyes.” “I never said I was.” “Why, you did!” “You didn’t attend.” “You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house.
We all exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.” “‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset.
Leonora was speeding—’” Lucy interrupted.
“Leonora?
Is Leonora the heroine?
Who’s the book by?” “Joseph Emery Prank.
‘Sunset.
Leonora speeding across the square.
Pray the saints she might not arrive too late.
Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it now—’” Lucy burst into laughter.
“‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed!
Why it’s Miss Lavish!
It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under somebody else’s name.” “Who may Miss Lavish be?” “Oh, a dreadful person—Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?” Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up.
“Of course I do.
I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street.
It was she who told me that you lived here.” “Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean something else.
She watched his head, which was almost resting against her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening.
“No wonder the novel’s bad,” she added.
“I never liked Miss Lavish.
But I suppose one ought to read it as one’s met her.” “All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature.
“Every one writes for money in these days.” “Oh, Cecil—!” “It is so.
I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow.
The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her.
She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?” “I never notice much difference in views.” “What do you mean?” “Because they’re all alike.
Because all that matters in them is distance and air.” “H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.” “I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up.
Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.” He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured.
“I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again.
I’m so sorry he’s not so well.” “No, he isn’t well.” “There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil.
“Also that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.” “Mr.
Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?” “None.
Why?” “You spoke of ‘us.’” “My mother, I was meaning.” Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!” “I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” “I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.
It is the first thing that I remember.” Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after tennis—he didn’t do.
He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.” “Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.” “No—read away.
I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud.
If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.” This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him.
It put their visitor in the position of a prig.
Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr.
Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book.
Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked.
But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning.
“Find me chapter two, if it isn’t bothering you.” Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.” She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.” He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone.
Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village.
The season was spring.’” Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose, for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read.
He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence, while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets.
All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’” Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use.
No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’” “This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last.
She thought a disaster was averted.
But when they entered the shrubbery it came.
The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring.
That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove.
Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I must write some letters,” and went up to her room.
Then she prepared for action.
Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty.
Perhaps there never is such a contest.
It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first aim was to defeat herself.
As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been.
Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him.
The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.
In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
“Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?” Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.
“There is a scene in it.
The hero and heroine make love.
Do you know about that?” “Dear—?” “Do you know about it, please?” she repeated.
“They are on a hillside, and Florence is in the distance.” “My good Lucia, I am all at sea.
I know nothing about it whatever.” “There are violets.
I cannot believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her?
I have thought before speaking; it _must_ be you.” “Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.” Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved.
“Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t put that in her book?” Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it.
Yes.” “Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” “So you did tell?” “I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of conversation—” “But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell mother?” “I will never forgive Eleanor.
She has betrayed my confidence.” “Why did you tell her, though?
This is a most serious thing.” Why does any one tell anything?
The question is eternal, and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response.
She had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again.
Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes?
Behind Cecil’s back as we were walking up the garden.” Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now?
Can you tell me?” “Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day.
Fancy if your prospects—” “I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word.
“I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.” It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince.
“However,” said the girl, despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done.
You have put me in a most awkward position.
How am I to get out of it?” Miss Bartlett could not think.
The days of her energy were over.
She was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that.
She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him?
I can’t tell mother now—owing to you.
Nor Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you.
I am caught up every way.
I think I shall go mad.
I have no one to help me.
That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.” Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing.
What’s to be _done?_ We women go maundering on.
What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?” “I always said he was a cad, dear.
Give me credit for that, at all events.
From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a bath.” “Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong!
We’ve both made a muddle of it.
George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he to be left unpunished, or isn’t he?
I want to know.” Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless.
Her own exposure had unnerved her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain.
She moved feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?” “Willingly would I move heaven and earth—” “I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously.
“Will you speak to him?
It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word.” “Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.” “It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture.
“No one will help me.
I will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below.
“Found the lost ball?
Good man!
Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you!
I admire you—” They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul.
Her anger faded at the sight of him.
Ah!
The Emersons were fine people in their way.
She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying: “Freddy has taken him into the dining-room.
The others are going down the garden.
Come.
Let us get this over quickly.
Come.
I want you in the room, of course.” “Lucy, do you mind doing it?” “How can you ask such a ridiculous question?” “Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand.
“I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded.
She remembered their last evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss Bartlett’s toque on the door.
She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time.
Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying.
“The jam’s jolly good.” George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room.
As she entered he stopped, and said: “No—nothing to eat.” “You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants.
Where’s mother?” “She’s started on her Sunday writing.
She’s in the drawing-room.” “That’s all right.
You go away.” He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table.
Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech.
She just said: “I can’t have it, Mr. Emerson.
I cannot even talk to you.
Go out of this house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door.
“I hate a row.
Go please.” “What—” “No discussion.” “But I can’t—” She shook her head.
“Go, please.
I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.” “You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t mean that you are going to marry that man?” The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her.
“You are merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse.
He’s only for an acquaintance.
He is for society and cultivated talk.
He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.” It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss—” “No, but have you ever?
He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.
It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.
I would never have let myself go.
But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters.
Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.
That is the man all over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find.
Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to settle whether you were shocked or no.
Cecil all over again.
He daren’t let a woman decide.
He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.
Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon.
Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’ because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control.
I’m not ashamed.
I don’t apologize.
But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you.
Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly?
But therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.” Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson.
Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.” And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality.
He said: “Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary.
“I’m the same kind of brute at bottom.
This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He thought.
“Yes—really in a better way.
I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards her.
“Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain.
I have cared for you since that man died.
I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun.
As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered.
I called.
I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.” “And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm.
“Does he not matter?
That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly?
A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?” He said: “It is our last chance.
I shall do all that I can.” And as if he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening.
“You wouldn’t stop us this second time if you understood,” he said.
“I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.” Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though demolishing some invisible obstacle.
She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
“It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really.
It is that love and youth matter intellectually.” In silence the two women watched him.
His last remark, they knew, was nonsense, but was he going after it or not?
Would not he, the cad, the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish?
No.
He was apparently content.
He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house.
Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!” Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet.
“Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the latter.
One more fuss through with you, Charlotte.
Many thanks.
I think, though, that this is the last.
My admirer will hardly trouble me again.” And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish: “Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it?
Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really.
It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.” “Let’s go down to them.” But, once in the open air, she paused.
Some emotion—pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring.
That something or other mattered intellectually?
A leaf, violently agitated, danced past her, while other leaves lay motionless.
That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy!
There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll hurry.” “Mr.
Emerson has had to go.” “What a nuisance!
That spoils the four.
I say, Cecil, do play, do, there’s a good chap.
It’s Floyd’s last day.
Do play tennis with us, just this once.” Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete.
As you well remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you.” The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes.
How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement.
Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered.
He had nothing to say.
He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things over.
We are too different.
I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.” It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—” “I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
“My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.” “I don’t understand you.
You aren’t like yourself.
You’re tired, Lucy.” “Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once.
“That is exactly like you.
You always think women don’t mean what they say.” “Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.” “What if I do?
It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth.
I can’t marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.” “You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches.
But give me a moment’s time.” He closed his eyes.
“You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.” It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
To bring on the crisis, she said: “There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.” “I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never could play.
I don’t understand a word you say.” “You can play well enough to make up a four.
I thought it abominably selfish of you.” “No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis.
Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
You talked of our wedding at lunch—at least, you let me talk.” “I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly.
“I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
Of course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.” She developed this position.
“Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted to be my husband?
I don’t think so.
You don’t like Freddy, nor my mother.
There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point.
They have to-day.
I see clearly.
I must speak.
That’s all.” “I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently.
“I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
It’s all too horrible.” “What’s the good of a scene?” “No good.
But surely I have a right to hear a little more.” He put down his glass and opened the window.
From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy or any one might be outside.” He obeyed.
“I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved me!” “I did not,” she said.
“I thought I did at first.
I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.” He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
She had counted on his being petty.
It would have made things easier for her.
By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently.
I dare say you are right not to.
But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.” “Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort who can’t know any one intimately.” A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that.
But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
It is that, more or less.
When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always protecting me.” Her voice swelled.
“I won’t be protected.
I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
To shield me is an insult.
Can’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
A woman’s place!
You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
That’s why I break off my engagement.
You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause.
Then Cecil said with great emotion: “It is true.” “True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word.
It is a revelation.
It is—I.” “Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.” He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true.
I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
You are even greater than I thought.” She withdrew a step.
“I’m not going to worry you.
You are far too good to me.
I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
I have never known you till this evening.
I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—” “What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance.
She cried: “If you think I am in love with some one else, you are very much mistaken.” “Of course I don’t think that.
You are not that kind, Lucy.” “Oh, yes, you do think it.
It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting, brutal!
As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.” He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past.
I shall never say it again.
You have taught me better.” She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity.
I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.” “All right, Cecil, that will do.
Don’t apologize to me.
It was my mistake.” “It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke.
“I must actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really am.
Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
Will you shake hands?” “Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
“Good-night, Cecil.
Good-bye.
That’s all right.
I’m sorry about it.
Thank you very much for your gentleness.” “Let me light your candle, shall I?” They went into the hall.
“Thank you.
Good-night again.
God bless you, Lucy!” “Good-bye, Cecil.” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry.
In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself.
She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within.
They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
As the years pass, they are censured.
Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one.
The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill.
On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy Corner,—he laughed.
The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.
The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road.
So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly.
Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.
One might laugh at the house, but one never shuddered.
Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip.
He had heard from the Miss Alans.
These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed their plans.
They were going to Greece instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter.
Of course, Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train.
But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.” Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her.
She would see the fun of it, and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty.
Though she was hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she could not play the piano as she did.
He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been understood.
This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been illustrated by facts.
Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.
Therefore it must be the horse, who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy.
They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs.
Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station.
They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it.
“Isn’t it wonderful?
Isn’t it romance?
Most certainly they will go to Constantinople.
They are taken in a snare that cannot fail.
They will end by going round the world.” Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious!
I never notice it in you young people; you do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing.
‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn!
No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans.
They want the Pension Keats.” “I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you any matches?” “I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?” “Never.” “Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit.
I haven’t been to Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my friends going.
It is altogether too big for our little lot.
Don’t you think so?
Italy is just about as much as we can manage.
Italy is heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus.
All right, Freddy—I am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
“I was saying, if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience.
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me.
There the contrast is just as much as I can realize.
But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the victoria.” “You’re quite right,” said Cecil.
“Greece is not for our little lot”; and he got in.
Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really.
And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box, which had not been returned.
As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
Cecil’s hard hit.
Lucy won’t marry him.
If you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down.” “But when—” “Late last night.
I must go.” “Perhaps they won’t want me down there.” “No—go on.
Good-bye.” “Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart.
The house was again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata.
He hesitated a moment, but went down the garden as requested.
There he found a mournful company.
It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of assistance.
At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe?
Gracious what a mess everything is!
Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.” Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her.
“You have worried them as much as they can stand.
Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly.
I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.” “Oh, must you?
Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it.” Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about for, either in the house or out of it.” Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.
As they walked up the garden, the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother.
Or will she come with us?” “I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.” “They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has gone, and Freddy won’t play with me.
In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.” “Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur.
“Go and put on your boots.” He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart.
She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do?
Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive.
Would you come too?” “I don’t think I will, thank you.” “No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.” Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!” “Yes.” “I met them on the hill.
Your brother told me.” “Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed.
Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.” “Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have done the right thing.” “So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.” “I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.” “So does mother.
Mother minds dreadfully.” “I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.
It was really a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.” “Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he?
I gathered that he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.” “Boys are so odd.” Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor.
Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel.
Mr. Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action, so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan.
That was really what brought me over.
I thought it might amuse you all.” “How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.
After a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with “Going abroad?
When do they start?” “Next week, I gather.” “Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
Always complaisant, he put the letter away.
But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!
How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad!” “I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast!” She laughed heartily.
“Oh, delightful!
I wish they’d take me.” “Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel?
Perhaps George Emerson is right.
He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’” “Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople.
I have always longed to go to Constantinople.
Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?” Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm.
She had always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed.
He saw, to his surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends, after Cissie Villa.” “Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would give anything to go with them.” “Would your mother spare you again so soon?
You have scarcely been home three months.” “She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement.
“I simply _must_ go away.
I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
“Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away?
I didn’t realize at the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.” “You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—” “Yes, yes.
I knew you’d understand.” Mr. Beebe did not quite understand.
Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family?
Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her.
Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying.
He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down.” “I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all.
Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so masterful.
I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
He would improve me in places where I can’t be improved.
Cecil won’t let a woman decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t.
What nonsense I do talk!
But that is the kind of thing.” “It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you.
I do sympathize and agree most profoundly.
I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?” “But I must go somewhere!” she cried.
“I have been worrying all the morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with clenched fists, and repeated: “I must!
And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
You all think much too highly of me.
I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased.
“I must get away, ever so far.
I must know my own mind and where I want to go.” “Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out of the front-door.
He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource.
She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be.
I know all about it.
The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak.” Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett.
As he had put it to himself at Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
He assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter drop.” “I wonder.” “It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street.
It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at the present moment.” Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows.
Death is a strong word—surely too strong.
There was no question of tragedy.
He said: “Of course, Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she chooses.
Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.” “I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly.
“Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you.
One cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy.
A chance word to a chattering friend, and—” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
A rector lives in a web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he will regard them.
He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately?
I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish.
It is odd how we of that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another’s lives.
Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.
We must really give the Signora a testimonial.” And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern.
On the summit they paused.
The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue.
Summer was retreating.
The wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven.
The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery.
Mr. Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.” They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.
That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably.
Mr. Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces.
They would hand the child her food through the window.
Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past.
I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit.
She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her.
But the future.
Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again.
“I don’t know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.” Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.” To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you.
In it I spy Lucy’s salvation.” “Really.
Now, why?” “She wanted to leave Windy Corner.” “I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to say—selfish.” “It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire a change.” Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect misses.
Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced.
Perhaps she must have a change.
I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand these things.
But why need she go as far as Greece?” “You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner.
“Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?)
Why not Tunbridge Wells?
Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning.
I cannot help her.
I will say no more.
Perhaps I have already said too much.
I am not to talk.
I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.” Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance.
I know too well that I get on Lucy’s nerves.
Our tour was a failure.
She wanted to leave Florence, and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.” “Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe.
“I want your advice.” “Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to him, though familiar to Lucy.
“I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?” Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd woman really did know.
“She must not stop here a moment, and we must keep quiet till she goes.
I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already.
Only, Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone.
If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—” “Otherwise—?” “Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.” Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude.
The tavern sign—a beehive trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him.
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another man” that would have attracted a grosser mind.
He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form.
Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry.
His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.
“They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure.
In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity.
The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement.
Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the action of others.
The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey.
He conversed on indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants; Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could literature influence life?
Windy Corner glimmered.
In the garden, Mrs. Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly.
“This comes of putting off.
We might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece.
I don’t know what the world’s coming to.” “Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must.
Come up to the house and let’s talk it over.
Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?” “Mr.
Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.” “So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good.
Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone.
It was expensive and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed.
Nor would Charlotte have succeeded.
The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right.
It must be something I can’t understand.
Lucy!
Let’s tell her.
Lucy!” “She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said.
He opened the door, and heard the words of a song: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.” “I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.” “Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——” “It’s a song that Cecil gave her.
How odd girls are!” “What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly.
She went into the drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.” Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a bit.” “And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you.” “Oh, splendid!
Oh, thank you!” Mr. Beebe followed.
Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys.
She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness.
Her mother bent over her.
Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_, in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and therefore ignored by the art of to-day.
Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens,” she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.” “Mr.
Beebe knows my rude ways.” “It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he.
“Go on.” “It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly.
“I forget why—harmony or something.” “I suspected it was unscholarly.
It’s so beautiful.” “The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten.
Why throw up the sponge?” “How stupidly you talk!” said his sister.
The _Santa Conversazione_ was broken up.
After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.” “Stop thine ear against the singer—” “Wait a minute; she is finishing.” “From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” “I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear.
She had behaved splendidly, and he had helped her.
He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl’s life.
If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—” Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly.
He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned: “Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX Lying to Mr. Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial England.
They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books, mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.
Miss Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one’s face in the train.
Lucy promised, a little depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.
A gentleman is such a stand-by.” Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine continued.
“It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.
But perhaps he will come out and join you later on.” “Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off.
I do so long to see him.” “No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“She doesn’t like it.” “No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really?
How funny!
I should have thought that in this case—” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going?
It is such a pleasure to have met you!” They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right.
We just got through that time.” But her mother was annoyed.
“I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it.
There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.” Lucy had plenty to say in reply.
She described the Miss Alans’ character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?” “Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then.
It’s much pleasanter.
How wet it is!
Let’s turn in here.” “Here” was the British Museum.
Mrs. Honeychurch refused.
If they must take shelter, let it be in a shop.
Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.
Let’s go to Mudie’s.
I’ll buy a guide-book.” “You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this hole-and-corner work.
You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute.
But why not announce it?
Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?” “It’s only for a few days.” “But why at all?” Lucy was silent.
She was drifting away from her mother.
It was quite easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the incidental advantage of being true.
But she could not say it.
She disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors—Light.
Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent.
She was thinking, “My daughter won’t answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me.
Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.” This was perfectly true.
Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no longer.
It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.
She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk!
Of course I’m not tired of Windy Corner.” “Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?” She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.” “Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?” “Hush, mother!
People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s.
She bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
You see, I come into my money next year.” Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed “eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear.
“I’ve seen the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy.
I have seen so little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like to-day, but to stop.
I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl.” “And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police.
And call it a Mission—when no one wants you!
And call it Duty—when it means that you can’t stand your own home!
And call it Work—when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is!
And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.” “I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys.
But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well.
Take your independence and be gone.
Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.” Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed.
“How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!” “_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.
“More every moment.” “I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike.” “Well, I see the likeness.
The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters.” “What rubbish!
And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you asked her to stop.
I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.” Lucy clenched her teeth.
“My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked Charlotte to stop.
I wish you would keep to the point.” And the conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station.
It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy.
Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful.
“The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked.
For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old mother.
“We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining.
Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was blurred by the soft road.
“_Can’t_ we have the hood down?” she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck.
But now that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?” “It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?” “Yes, miss, they have gone.” Lucy sank back.
The carriage stopped at the Rectory.
She got out to call for Miss Bartlett.
So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary.
Waste!
That word seemed to sum up the whole of life.
Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded her mother.
Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible.
Other people had.
When the maid opened the door, she was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a great favour: might she go to church?
Mr. Beebe and his mother had already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily.
“I forgot it was Friday.
Let’s all go.
Powell can go round to the stables.” “Lucy dearest—” “No church for me, thank you.” A sigh, and they departed.
The church was invisible, but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour.
This was a stained window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation.
Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?
There was only that one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait, sir.” Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips.
George she had faced, and could have faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry!
George is so sorry!
He thought he had a right to try.
I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first.
He ought not to have tried.
I knew nothing about it at all.” If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand.
“But you must not scold him.” Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love.
I said: ‘When love comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind.
No.
Passion is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my day is over, and though there is the result.
Poor boy!
He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that whatever you felt you did not mean.
Yet”—his voice gathered strength: he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?” Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries.
Holding it up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son.” “But you do remember it?” “He has misbehaved himself from the first.” “I only was told that he loved you last Sunday.
I never could judge behaviour.
I—I—suppose he has.” Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to him.
His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said.
“I am glad he is sorry.
Do you know what he did?” “Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction.
“He only tried when he should not have tried.
You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are going to marry the man you love.
Do not go out of George’s life saying he is abominable.” “No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong.
I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all.
My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late—” “Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?” “Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.” “As his mother did.” “But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr.
Emerson_—what are you talking about?” “When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round.
She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered.
“Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in again!
A judgement!
And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church!
Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch?
Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever?” “I don’t know,” gasped Lucy.
“I don’t understand this sort of thing.
I was not meant to understand it.” “But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his principles.
I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was well she was ill.
He made her think about sin, and she went under thinking about it.” It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man.
“I did hold firm.” And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what cost!—he had won a victory over them.
“My boy shall go back to the earth untouched.” She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill. “Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present.
“George last Sunday—no, not ill: just gone under.
He is never ill.
But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
It was always touch and go.
He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live.
He will never think anything worth while.
You remember that church at Florence?” Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible.
Then we took the house here, and he goes bathing with your brother, and became better.
You saw him bathing?” “I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair.
I am deeply sorry about it.” “Then there came something about a novel.
I didn’t follow it at all; I had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old.
Ah, well, one must have failures.
George comes down to-morrow, and takes me up to his London rooms.
He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be where he is.” “Mr.
Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my account.
I am going to Greece.
Don’t leave your comfortable house.” It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled.
“How good everyone is!
And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning and heard I was going!
Here I am so comfortable with a fire.” “Yes, but you won’t go back to London.
It’s absurd.” “I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he can’t.
He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t.
I’ve been bother enough to the world by now.
I can’t have you moving out of your house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my account.
You must stop!
I am just going to Greece.” “All the way to Greece?” Her manner altered.
“To Greece?” “So you must stop.
You won’t talk about this business, I know.
I can trust you both.” “Certainly you can.
We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the life that you have chosen.” “I shouldn’t want—” “I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George?
No, it was wrong of George to try.
We have pushed our beliefs too far.
I fancy that we deserve sorrow.” She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling.
To Lucy who could not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still.
I think I will sit in the carriage.” “Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.” “Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you.
And what were you saying about going abroad?” She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands.
Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you.
I hope—it isn’t because George spoke that you are both going?” “No.” “I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.” “Thank you.” At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church.
His cassock was covered with rain.
“That’s all right,” he said kindly.
“I counted on you two keeping each other company.
It’s pouring again.
The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it.
Did Powell go round?” “I think so; I’ll see.” “No—of course, I’ll see.
How are the Miss Alans?” “Very well, thank you.” “Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?” “I—I did.” “Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the two Miss Alans?
Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm.
I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely.
“I made a slip.
Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England.” Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man.
To George, to Cecil, she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece.
And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving him?
You are leaving the man you love?” “I—I had to.” “Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?” Terror came over her, and she lied again.
She made the long, convincing speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more.
He heard her in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.
It seems to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.” She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world.
It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so dreadful.
It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the things that I might have avoided.
We can help one another but little.
I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle.
Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren’t?
Do you remember before, when you refused the room with the view?
Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent.
“Don’t trust me, Miss Honeychurch.
Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was still silent.
“‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’ I think he puts it well.
Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean.
You love George!” And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
“You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
You won’t marry the other man for his sake.” “How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man.” “But you are.” She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.
It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way.
You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat.
I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and _for which_ you marry.
I know that, with George, you will find them, and that you love him.
Then be his wife.
He is already part of you.
Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part.
You will wish that it was.
You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.
I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the body.
Ah!
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that!
Ah!
for a little directness to liberate the soul!
Your soul, dear Lucy!
I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round.
But we have souls.
I cannot say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining yours.
I cannot bear it.
It is again the darkness creeping in; it is hell.” Then he checked himself.
“What nonsense I have talked—how abstract and remote!
And I have made you cry!
Dear girl, forgive my prosiness; marry my boy.
When I think what life is, and how seldom love is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made.” She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.
Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
“Cecil—Mr.
Beebe—the ticket’s bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair.
“I’m caught in the tangle.
I must suffer and grow old away from him.
I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
They trusted me.” A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only.
Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—” “No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—” “But why should they, when you have deceived them?” Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.” “You’re not worthy of their trust.” “What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?” “One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson.
To whom do you refer?
Trust whom?” “I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George.
They have loved one another all along.” Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman.
A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?” “Mr.
Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—” “Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!” “It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly.
“It’s the part of people that you don’t understand.” Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy!
Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr.
Beebe, could you help me?” He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am more grieved than I can possibly express.
It is lamentable, lamentable—incredible.” “What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me.
Marry George, Miss Honeychurch.
He will do admirably.” He walked out and left them.
They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair.
But his face revived her.
It was the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark.
Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know.
But remember the mountains over Florence and the view.
Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise.
George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him.
Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.” “You kiss me,” said the girl.
“You kiss me.
I will try.” He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his salutation remained.
He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he managed to strengthen her.
It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once.” Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves.
They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf.
They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity.
Trembling, anxious, cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go round the world.
The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had your father’s room.
I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.” He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.” “Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window.
It was evening and again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully.
“What can such people be made of?” “Same stuff as parsons are made of.” “Nonsense!” “Quite right.
It is nonsense.” “Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.” “Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and advancing his face to hers.
“What’s there to cry at?
Kiss me here.” He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all.
When it came to the point, it was she who remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who knew whose room this had been last year.
It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.” “Now kiss me here; then here.” Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window, opened it (as the English will), and leant out.
There was the parapet, there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills.
The cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago.
A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool.
He had helped himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its name is, still shows.” “San Miniato.
I’ll just finish your sock.” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils, the Miss Bartletts!
Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?” “Not yet.” His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?” “Silly boy!
He thinks he’s being dignified.
He knew we should go off in the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands.
They had fair warning, and now he calls it an elopement.
Ridiculous boy—” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” “But it will all come right in the end.
He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women.
He has, for the second time, quite altered.
Why will men have theories about women?
I haven’t any about men.
I wish, too, that Mr. Beebe—” “You may well wish that.” “He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us again.
I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner.
I wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run.” “Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only thing I did do—and you came back to me.
So possibly you know.” He turned back into the room.
“Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to the window, so that she, too, saw all the view.
They sank upon their knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one another’s names.
Ah!
it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—” “Oh, bother that man!” But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte.
How cruel she would be to a man like that!” “Look at the lights going over the bridge.” “But this room reminds me of Charlotte.
How horrible to grow old in Charlotte’s way!
To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house.
For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
You couldn’t have made me.
When I am very happy”—she kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs.
If Charlotte had only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to silly Greece, and become different for ever.” “But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely.
He said so.” “Oh, no, she didn’t see him.
She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church.
She said so.” George was obstinate again.
“My father,” said he, “saw her, and I prefer his word.
He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett.
A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up.
He didn’t speak to her.” Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other’s arms.
It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting.
George, who disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew.
Then, why did she risk the meeting?
She knew he was there, and yet she went to church.” They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind.
She rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?” “Mean what?” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.” “Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.” “Niente.” The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?” He whispered: “Is it this?
Is this possible?
I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped.
That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down.
That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped.
I can’t explain her any other way.
Can you?
Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable.
The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend.
There are details—it burnt.
I read the book afterwards.
She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through.
She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
We can never make friends with her or thank her.
But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.” “It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.” Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited, love attained.
But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean.
[Illustration] A Room With A View By E. M. Forster CONTENTS PART ONE Chapter I The Bertolini “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at all.
She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart.
Oh, Lucy!” “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the Signora’s unexpected accent.
“It might be London.” She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A.
Oxon.
), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London?
I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside.
I suppose it is one’s being so tired.” “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno.
The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.
The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!” “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that you shouldn’t have a view.” Lucy felt that she had been selfish.
“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of course, you must look over the Arno, too.
I meant that.
The first vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no.
You must have it.” “I insist on it.
Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.” “She would never forgive _me_.” The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a little peevish.
They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument.
He said: “I have a view, I have a view.” Miss Bartlett was startled.
Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.
She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she glanced at him.
He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes.
There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes.
These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim.
So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A view?
Oh, a view!
How delightful a view is!” “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George.
He has a view too.” “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have yours.
We’ll change.” The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.
Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.” “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.” “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy.
Her cousin again repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted.
“Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son.
“There’s nothing else to say.” He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful.
Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before.
Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change?
What possible objection had she?
They would clear out in half an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality.
It was impossible to snub any one so gross.
Her face reddened with displeasure.
She looked around as much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are genteel.” “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear.
This pension is a failure.
To-morrow we will make a change.” Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness.
Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh!
Why, it’s Mr. Beebe!
Oh, how perfectly lovely!
Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are.
Oh!” Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint: “How do you do, Mr. Beebe?
I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.” The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.
But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
“Just fancy how small the world is.
Summer Street, too, makes it so specially funny.” “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—” “Yes, I heard from mother so last week.
She didn’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr.
Beebe is—’” “Quite right,” said the clergyman.
“I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June.
I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.” “Oh, how glad I am!
The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.” “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.” “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.” He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons.
He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before.
It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field.
“Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded.
“The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.” “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table.
“Mr.
Beebe, you are wrong.
The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.” “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin.
“We are in luck.” And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them.
People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would grow upon them.
The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do.
Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them.
And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato!
They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words.
I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.” The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did.
It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more than cloth.
Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her daughter.
It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.
Was this really Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.
She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle.
“We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.
“The first evening means so much.
When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.” He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?” “Emerson.” “Is he a friend of yours?” “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.” “Then I will say no more.” He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing.
His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.” “You acted very naturally,” said he.
He seemed thoughtful, and after a few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of accepting.” “No _harm_, of course.
But we could not be under an obligation.” “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show gratitude.
He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he means.
He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them.
He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite.
It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.” Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice.” “I think he is; nice and tiresome.
I differ from him on almost every point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores.
When he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up.
He has no tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will not keep his opinions to himself.
We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.” “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?” Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?” “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet.
He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains.
Of course, he has all his father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.” “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett.
“So you think I ought to have accepted their offer?
You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?” “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.” “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?” He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared.
“Why didn’t you talk, Lucy?
He prefers young people, I’m sure.
I do hope I haven’t monopolized him.
I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time.” “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a clergyman.” “My dear Lucia—” “Well, you know what I mean.
And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.” “Funny girl!
How you do remind me of your mother.
I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe.” “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.” “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world.
I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.” “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine.
She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered.
Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.” And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more careful.
It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.” Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat.
Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room.
It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England.
Signora Bertolini is so English.” “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy.
“We dread going to bed.” “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed.
“If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful!
We were so sorry for you at dinner.” “I think he was meaning to be kind.” “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr.
Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature.
Of course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.” “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
No one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know.
No, he is not tactful; yet, have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?” “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.
“Are not beauty and delicacy the same?” “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly.
“But things are so difficult, I sometimes think.” She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms.
I’m so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again.
He has let me come and ask you.
He would be so pleased.” “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious.
I must apologize for my interference.” Gravely displeased, he turned to go.
Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours.
It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only here through your kindness.
If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it.
Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?” She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this.
I do not wish the acceptance to come from you.
Grant me that, at all events.” Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously: “Mr.
Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.” The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally.
But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out.” Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath.
All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first.
Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms!
It is all he can do to keep polite.” “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe.
Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.
“Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part.
Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature.
Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow.
Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said: “I think one might venture now.
No, Lucy, do not stir.
I will superintend the move.” “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear.
It is my affair.” “But I would like to help you.” “No, dear.” Charlotte’s energy!
And her unselfishness!
She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
So Lucy felt, or strove to feel.
And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful.
At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room.
Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.” Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him.
I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.” “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.
It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances.
It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation.
Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle.
Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson.
So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him.
Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.
It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
An electric tram came rushing underneath the window.
No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand.
Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go.
Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.
Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.
The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway.
Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.
So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone.
By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.
Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out?
Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone.
Miss Bartlett could not allow this.
Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin.
Oh, no!
that would never do.
Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person.
Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe.
Italians understand.
A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.
Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.” Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad.
The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.” Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut!
Miss Lucy!
I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He does but touch the surface of things.
As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it.
The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.” This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.
Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno.
How delightfully warm!
But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?
Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante.
San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story.
The men on the river were fishing.
(Untrue; but then, so is most information.)
Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried: “A smell!
a true Florentine smell!
Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.” “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
Buon giorno!
Buon giorno!” bowing right and left.
“Look at that adorable wine-cart!
How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!” So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.
It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno!
Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors.
_That_ is the true democracy.
Though I am a real Radical as well.
There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy.
“We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.” “I see, I see.
And now you have gone over to the enemy.” “Oh, please—!
If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right.
And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.” “Shameful!
A manufacturing district, I suppose?” “No—in the Surrey hills.
About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.” Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well.
It is full of the very nicest people.
Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?” “Very well indeed.” “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?” “Why, she rents a field of us!
How funny!” Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?” “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob.
“Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.” Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
Italy receded.
They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her.
And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed: “Bless us!
Bless us and save us!
We’ve lost the way.” Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window.
But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost!
lost!
My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.
How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do?
Two lone females in an unknown town.
Now, this is what _I_ call an adventure.” Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven!
And no, you are not, not, _not_ to look at your Baedeker.
Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it.
We will simply drift.” Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became discontented herself.
For one ravishing moment Italy appeared.
She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale.
There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven.
Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop, because it looked so typical.
It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown.
But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness.
Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically.
It was Santa Croce.
The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them.
I do detest conventional intercourse.
Nasty!
they are going into the church, too.
Oh, the Britisher abroad!” “We sat opposite them at dinner last night.
They have given us their rooms.
They were so very kind.” “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish.
“They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.
It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.” “What would you ask us?” Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she, at all events, would get full marks.
In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried: “There goes my local-colour box!
I must have a word with him!” And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes.
Then she began to get tired.
The beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places.
She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original.
But at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both gesticulating largely.
Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her Baedeker.
How could she find her way home?
How could she find her way about in Santa Croce?
Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in Florence again.
A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans.
Of course, it must be a wonderful building.
But how like a barn!
And how very cold!
Of course, it contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper.
But who was to tell her which they were?
She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
There was no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she began to be happy.
She puzzled out the Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.
She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed.
Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated.
What could this mean?
They did it again and again.
Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue.
Punishment followed quickly.
The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward.
She was too late.
He fell heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted forward also.
“Hard in life, hard in death.
Go out into the sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
Intolerable bishop!” The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and frightened!
But what else can you expect from a church?” The child’s legs had become as melting wax.
Each time that old Mr. Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar.
Fortunately an Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue.
By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
He stood.
Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson.
“You have done more than all the relics in the world.
I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy.
There is no scheme of the universe—” He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons.
She was determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply.
“But what are you doing here?
Are you doing the church?
Are you through with the church?” “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance.
“I came here with Miss Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.” “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.” “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
“I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded.
It’s worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker.
_That’s_ worth minding.” Lucy was puzzled.
She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where the idea would lead?
She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you.
I really came to help with the child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.” “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say.
You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious.
But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it.
Lucy could not get cross.
Mr. Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him.
On the other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him.
It was at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope.
It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will kindly tell me which they are.” The son nodded.
With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel.
There was a hint of the teacher about him.
She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared.
Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective.
Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true?
How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!” “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort!
Built by faith indeed!
That simply means the workmen weren’t paid properly.
And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
Look at that fat man in blue!
He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.” He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might.
The audience shifted uneasily, and so did Lucy.
She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her.
They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it?
Yes or no?” George replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all.
I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.” “You will never go up,” said his father.
“You and I, dear boy, will lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives.” “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is, going up.
It did happen like that, if it happened at all.” “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice.
“The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.” The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands.
They filed out of the chapel in silence.
Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“There’s plenty of room for us all.
Stop!” The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.” George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is.
I don’t remember.” “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
It’s that Mr.
Eager.
Why did he go?
Did we talk too loud?
How vexatious.
I shall go and say we are sorry.
Hadn’t I better?
Then perhaps he will come back.” “He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
Cuthbert Eager.
Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent.
The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her.
“He will try to be kind.” “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters.
But he is kind to people because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.” “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully—” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain.
Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness.
She saw him once again at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns.
Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only find solution in the night.
The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people.
They won’t come back.” “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy.
“Have you looked at those saints?” “Yes,” said Lucy.
“They are lovely.
Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin?” He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.
There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists.
But Mr. Emerson was only half interested.
He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily.
“I saw nothing in it.” “I like Giotto,” she replied.
“It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values.
Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
A baby is worth a dozen saints.
And my baby’s worth the whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.” Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated.
“He’s unhappy.” “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?
What more is one to give him?
And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God.
With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.” She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one.
She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked.
“He comes out for his holiday to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone.
Eh?
What did you say?” Lucy had made no suggestion.
Suddenly he said: “Now don’t be stupid over this.
I don’t require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me.
He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose?
But let yourself go.
You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night.
Let yourself go.
Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself.
It will be good for both of you.” To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.” “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.” “What things?” “The things of the universe.
It is quite true.
They don’t.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?” In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: “‘From far, from eve and morning, The stuff of life to knit me George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?
We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
But why should this make us unhappy?
Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice.
I don’t believe in this world sorrow.” Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us.
Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.” Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.
A young man melancholy because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried.
“You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then she became matronly.
“Oh, but your son wants employment.
Has he no particular hobby?
Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother.
Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.” The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it.
Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.
Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.
The dear George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd.
He approached, his face in the shadow.
He said: “Miss Bartlett.” “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective.
“Where?
Where?” “In the nave.” “I see.
Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson.
“Poor girl!” She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
“Poor girl?
I fail to understand the point of that remark.
I think myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you.
I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid time.
Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it.
Good-bye.
Thank you both so much for all your kindness.
Ah, yes!
there does come my cousin.
A delightful morning!
Santa Croce is a wonderful church.” She joined her cousin.
Chapter III Music, Violets, and the Letter “S” It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano.
She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected.
The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom.
Lucy had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.
Nor was she the passionate young lady, who performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the pictorial style.
And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory.
Victory of what and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano.
A few people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep.
She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarette-case.
Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it.
It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower.
The seats were filled with a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork.
Among the promised items was “Miss Honeychurch.
Piano.
Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III.
He was in suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends.
With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory.
He was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen.
The audience clapped, no less respectful.
It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners.
I do not consider her choice of a piece happy.
Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs.” “Introduce me.” “She will be delighted.
She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon.” “My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe.
“Why ever did she listen to it?” When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch, disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face.
She loved going to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and meringues.
He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also.
But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him: “If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting both for us and for her.” Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing!
Some one said just the same to mother, and she said she trusted I should never live a duet.” “Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?” “She doesn’t mind it.
But she doesn’t like one to get excited over anything; she thinks I am silly about it.
She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any one’s.
She has never got over it.
Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant—” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality.
She could not complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet.
The whole life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey, and the hills were dirty purple.
Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold, tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and a tickling cough in her throat.
On another day, when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray.
She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe.” “Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy.
This was a stock remark, the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition.
Miss Lavish was so original.
Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness.
For that, and for other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is writing a book?” “They do say so.” “What is it about?” “It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know.” “I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.
We started such friends.
But I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce.
Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.” “The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.” He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish.
They were always in each other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third.
Miss Lavish he believed he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning.
Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells?
All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work.
Girls like Lucy were charming to look at, but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped.
The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore.
But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse.
She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill!
And Mr. Beebe here besides.
Who would suppose this is Italy?
There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.” She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in my room with the door shut.
Doors shut; indeed, most necessary.
No one has the least idea of privacy in this country.
And one person catches it from another.” Lucy answered suitably.
Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.
The Italians are a most unpleasant people.
They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves.
We are at their mercy.
They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires.
From the cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial!
They have no conception of the intellectual life.
How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer over the children’s edjucaishion.
_Hi_ won’t ’ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’” Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way.
Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers.
Indeed, who would have supposed that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last the cause was disclosed.
From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “E.
L.” “That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman.
“A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she’d start a pipe.” “Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.
She took to it, practically in despair, after her life’s work was carried away in a landslip.
Surely that makes it more excusable.” “What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say they nearly always do.
Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink.
She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written.
The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she had an idea.
First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came here—this must on no account get round.
And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.” Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring.
She felt she had made almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.” Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade.
That old Mr. Emerson, who puts things very strangely—” Her jaw dropped.
She was silent.
Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper: “Stomach.
He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind.
I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden.
As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter.
But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought.
She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce.
Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson.
Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ Just imagine!
‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak.
I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking.
I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman!
I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place.
But that was not all.
After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.” “Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I shall go alone.’ She went.
At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.” “Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows.
No one will ever know.
Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.” “Mr.
Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice?
I do so want to know.” Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.
“No; but it is so difficult.
Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him.
Miss Alan, what do you think?
Is he nice?” The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.
Mr. Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying: “I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.” “Violets?
Oh, dear!
Who told you about the violets?
How do things get round?
A pension is a bad place for gossips.
No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce.
Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch!
It really was too bad.
No, I have quite changed.
I do _not_ like the Emersons.
They are _not_ nice.” Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly.
He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed.
He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them.
Miss Lavish, who represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans, who stood for good breeding, were following her.
Miss Bartlett, smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil.
The case of Lucy was different.
She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail.
After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now.
Even their seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once.
Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite politely, of course.” “Most right of her.
They don’t understand our ways.
They must find their level.” Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under.
They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son.
He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them.
It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle.
There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief.
“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said Lucy.
“I want to go round the town in the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say: “I wish we could.
Unluckily I have letters.
If you do want to go out alone, won’t you be better on your feet?” “Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!” But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her from the window, “and she knows it.
I put it down to too much Beethoven.” Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr. Beebe was right.
Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music.
She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan.
Conversation was tedious; she wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram.
This she might not attempt.
It was unladylike.
Why?
Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why.
It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different.
Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much.
But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.
The dragons have gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst.
She reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early Victorian song.
It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas!
the creature grows degenerate.
In her heart also there are springing up strange desires.
She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.
Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are alive.
Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
Nor has she any system of revolt.
Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she had done so.
This afternoon she was peculiarly restive.
She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved.
As she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus, being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it.
(A pity in art of course signified the nude.)
Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it.
She felt a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s “Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni Madonnas.
For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.
She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her to be conscious of it.
“The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to her.
The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it.
Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind.
It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.
An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him, and rest content.
Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.
It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky.
Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.
“Cinque lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest.
He frowned; he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all.
A crowd rose out of the dusk.
It hid this extraordinary man from her, and bore him away to the fountain.
Mr. George Emerson happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where the man had been.
How very odd!
Across something.
Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?” “Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything.
She had complained of dullness, and lo!
one man was stabbed, and another held her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade.
He must have carried her.
He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees.
She repeated: “Oh, what have I done?” “You fainted.” “I—I am very sorry.” “How are you now?” “Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home.
There’s no point in our stopping.” He held out his hand to pull her up.
She pretended not to see it.
The cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily.
The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been!
I might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well.
I can go alone, thank you.” His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?” “I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.
I must have dropped them out there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously.
“Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?” He added to his kindness.
As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!” She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.” “Yes, I am, thank you so very much.” “No, you aren’t.
You’d go openly if you were.” “But I had rather—” “Then I don’t fetch your photographs.” “I had rather be alone.” He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him.
“And don’t move till I come back.” In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in dreams.
The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day, and joined itself to earth.
How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square?
Again the thought occurred to her, “Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man, had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder.
Oddly enough, it was an easy topic.
She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before.
Being strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood.
She rose without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her, she walked firmly enough towards the Arno.
There a cabman signalled to them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police!
Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish.
When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?” He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?” “Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr.
Emerson!” “Well?” “Where are the photographs?” He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.” “I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.
Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood.
There!
I’m glad I’ve told you; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them.” He pointed down-stream.
“They’ve gone.” The river swirled under the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man.
“For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled.
It isn’t exactly that a man has died.” Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.” “Mr.
Emerson—” He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.” They were close to their pension.
She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment.
He did likewise.
There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship.
She moved her elbows before saying: “I have behaved ridiculously.” He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what came over me.” “I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.” “Oh, all right.” “And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?” “I’m afraid I don’t.” “I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?” “Your behaviour?
Oh, yes, all right—all right.” “Thank you so much.
And would you—” She could not carry her request any further.
The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
He had thrown her photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason.
It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man.
He would do her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might even have a high opinion of her.
But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe.
It was useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.
She had been in his arms, and he remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari’s shop.
It was not exactly that a man had died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents do happen, and then one returns to the old life!” “I don’t.” Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.” “But why, Mr. Emerson?
What do you mean?” “I shall want to live, I say.” Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno, whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson.
She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also.
They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.
It might have been most unpleasant.
Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone.
None of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the embankment.
Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure, not that she had encountered it.
This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action.
There were two plans between which she had to choose.
Mr. Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies.
Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?
Charlotte declined for herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.
But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth.
“It’s very kind of Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you.
I had much rather.” “Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.
How abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always!
But now she should alter.
All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the Lung’ Arno.
The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and colour.
Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it.
She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this, too!” Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did.
“Look, Lucia!
Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party.
I feared you would repent you of your choice.” Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.
Yesterday had been a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo.
Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not to re-enter it.
She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately remained.
Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria.
She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance.
For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.
She hailed them briskly.
The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett.
“After your despair of yesterday!
What a fortunate thing!” “Aha!
Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck.
Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?” “I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.” The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless creatures.
I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn’t pry.” She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few calculations in realism.
Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material.
A good deal of it was unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt.
The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note.
For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.” That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?” Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot.
But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish concluded.
“It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline.
There will be a deal of local colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall also introduce some humorous characters.
And let me give you all fair warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.” “Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett.
“I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons.” Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can.
For I repeat and I insist, and I have always held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life.” There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded.
Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett.
“That last remark struck me as so particularly true.
It should be a most pathetic novel.” Lucy assented.
At present her great aim was not to get put into it.
Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,” continued Miss Bartlett slowly.
“None but the superficial would be shocked at her.
We had a long talk yesterday.
She believes in justice and truth and human interest.
She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr.
Eager!
Why, how nice!
What a pleasant surprise!” “Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.” “We were chatting to Miss Lavish.” His brow contracted.
“So I saw.
Were you indeed?
Andate via!
sono occupato!” The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile.
“I am about to venture a suggestion.
Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a drive in the hills?
We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour’s ramble on the hillside.
The view thence of Florence is most beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape.
Decidedly.
But who looks at it to-day?
Ah, the world is too much for us.” Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that Mr.
Eager was no commonplace chaplain.
He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home.
He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent.
Tea at a Renaissance villa?
Nothing had been said about it yet.
But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same.
But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew.
A drive in the hills with Mr.
Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no longer the greatest of them.
She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain.
“In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity.
Andate via!
andate presto, presto!
Ah, the town!
Beautiful as it is, it is the town.” They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies.
To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and humiliating.” “Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened.
She can hardly bear to speak of it.” She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question.
“Do not blame her, please, Mr.
Eager.
The fault is mine: I left her unchaperoned.” “So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable.
His dark, handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.” “One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience.
I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?” Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—” “Were over at the Loggia.” “That must have saved you much.
You have not, of course, seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.” Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal league of Italy with youth.
He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr.
Eager, binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico’s angels.
She tore.
A shrill cry rose from the vendor.
The book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr.
Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a grievance.
His mysterious persecution of Mr.
Eager became relentless; the air rang with his threats and lamentations.
He appealed to Lucy; would not she intercede?
He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on bread.
He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued.
Under the chaplain’s guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy.
She had been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr.
Eager, she knew not why.
And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased to respect them.
She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist.
She doubted that Mr.
Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose.
They were tried by some new test, and they were found wanting.
As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte she was exactly the same.
It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact.
A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press.
I came across him at Brixton.” They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr.
Eager, “one has only sympathy for their success.
The desire for education and for social advance—in these things there is something not wholly vile.
There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as they would make of it.” “Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.” He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.” “Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead.
I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with me.
He was in my London parish long ago.
The other day in Santa Croce, when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him.
Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub.” “What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr.
Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended.
Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity.
Lucy, though she wished never to see the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man?
We know that already.” “Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all.
The boy—an innocent child at the time—I will exclude.
God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him.” “Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not hear.” “To speak plainly,” said Mr.
Eager, “it is.
I will say no more.” For the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the first time in her life.
“You have said very little.” “It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.
He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips.
It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily.
“That man murdered his wife!” “How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.
That day in Santa Croce—did they say anything against me?” “Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.” “Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you.
But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
“They’re nothing to me.” “How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene.
The shopman was possibly listening.
“She will find it difficult.
For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God.” The addition of God was striking.
But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
A silence followed which might have been impressive, but was merely awkward.
Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive.
“Drive?
Oh, is our drive to come off?” Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr.
Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed.
“It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all.
Why should he invite us in that absurd manner?
We might as well invite him.
We are each paying for ourselves.” Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish.” “How?” “Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.” “That will mean another carriage.” “Far worse.
Mr.
Eager does not like Eleanor.
She knows it herself.
The truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.” They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank.
Lucy stood by the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer, or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain.
The well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets?
Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it.
Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck.
She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank.
As she groped she murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr.
Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we must be prepared.
It is you they really want; I am only asked for appearances.
You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will follow behind.
A one-horse carriage would do for us.
Yet how difficult it is!” “It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.” “Oh, dear, Lucy!
I do hope Florence isn’t boring you.
Speak the word, and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.” “Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her mother’s letters could be.
She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway.
She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs.
Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news that interested her least.
“Do you know the Vyses?” “Oh, not that way back.
We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria.” “They’re nice people, the Vyses.
So clever—my idea of what’s really clever.
Don’t you long to be in Rome?” “I die for it!” The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant.
It has no grass, no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick.
By an odd chance—unless we believe in a presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity.
Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before.
Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly.
“Here’s an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel?
For I do know what I want.
I’m sick of Florence.
No, you said you’d go to the ends of the earth!
Do!
Do!” Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied: “Oh, you droll person!
Pray, what would become of your drive in the hills?” They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up the stony hill.
Mr. Beebe recognized him at once.
Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.
And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light.
To her Mr.
Eager objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition.
But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
She did not mind.
Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy.
The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss Lavish.
For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting Mr.
Eager, had doubled the size of the party.
And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus transformed.
Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.
But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr.
Eager, repressive towards Miss Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring.
She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate.
But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully.
In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy.
She had refused, not because she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he did know.
And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia, but by the river.
To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled emotion, but of the whole fabric.
There was really something blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word.
This sense of wickedness had been slight at first.
She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo.
But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again.
And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr.
Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling?
As a student of art?” “Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!” “Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like myself?” “Oh, no.
I am here as a tourist.” “Oh, indeed,” said Mr.
Eager.
“Are you indeed?
If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.
The result is, they mix up towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl.
You know the American girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’ There’s travelling for you.
Ha!
ha!
ha!” “I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit.
“The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.” “Quite so.
Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are here for trade, for example.
But the greater part are students.
Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico.
I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left.
No, you can only see it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall.
She is very proud of that thick hedge.
Inside, perfect seclusion.
One might have gone back six hundred years.
Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?” “It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish.
“Tell me, where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day?” But Mr.
Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr.
Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill.
“Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’?
He is working at Gemistus Pletho.
Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.” During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully.
Lucy had a spasm of envy.
Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.
They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road.
“Piano!
piano!” said Mr.
Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped his horses up again.
Now Mr.
Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or was he one of its manifestations?
The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.
“Piano!
piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.
Phaethon, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was most unpleasant.
The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr.
Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but at its manner.
At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and patted them on the back to signify his approval.
And Miss Lavish, though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried.
“But I dare say I shall receive scant support.
I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life.
This is what _I_ call an adventure.” “We must not submit,” said Mr.
Eager.
“I knew he was trying it on.
He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.” “Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood in no awe.
“Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there?
To be driven by lovers—A king might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I know.” Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect.
Mr.
Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will, was determined to make himself heard.
He addressed the driver again.
Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream, with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker, and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased.
Why should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto.
She pointed at the other carriage.
Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other.
Then Persephone got down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr.
Eager, smiting his hands together as the carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson.
“It is defeat.
You have parted two people who were happy.” Mr.
Eager shut his eyes.
He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but he would not speak to him.
The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took up the matter warmly.
He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money.
He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.
We have no rights over his soul.” Miss Lavish frowned.
It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said.
“He jolted us.” “That I deny.
It was as restful as sleeping.
Aha!
he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder?
He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is justified.
And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl, too.
It doesn’t do to injure young people.
Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici?” Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have.
Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature?” “The Lord knows.
Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go fighting against the Spring.’” Mr.
Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured.
“‘War not with the May’ would render a correct meaning.” “The point is, we have warred with it.
Look.” He pointed to the Val d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them.
Do you suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man?
But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.” No one encouraged him to talk.
Presently Mr.
Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain.
It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before.
He had ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending.
Standing there, he had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work.
But where exactly had he stood?
That was the question which Mr.
Eager hoped to solve now.
And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups.
Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask.
In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio Baldovinetti, but the drive.
Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was very sorry that she had asked him.
She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him.
Mr. Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish.
“Oh, but I shall die!
Of course it was the railway!” She could not control her mirth.
“He is the image of a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.” “Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion.
“Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—” “I can’t stop.
Let me go my wicked way.
A porter—” “Eleanor!” “I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy.
“The Emersons won’t hear, and they wouldn’t mind if they did.” Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly.
“Pouf!
Wouf!
You naughty girl!
Go away!” “Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr.
Eager, I’m sure.” “I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.” “Mr.
Eager will be offended.
It is your party.” “Please, I’d rather stop here with you.” “No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish.
“It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.
Miss Lucy, you are to go.
We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.” The girl was stubborn.
As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.
Such a one was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte.
She wished she had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Oh, I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here.” Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm.
Lucy did not look at the view either.
She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish.
“Observe my foresight.” With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy.
The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
If I do feel it coming on I shall stand.
Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist.
“Here we are, all settled delightfully.
Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown.
Sit down, dear; you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared her throat.
“Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold.
It’s the tiniest cough, and I have had it three days.
It’s nothing to do with sitting here at all.” There was only one way of treating the situation.
At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr.
Eager, vanquished by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.
The miscreant, a bony young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up.
Of course he knew where.
Not so far either.
His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon.
He should just think he did know where.
He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary.
What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good?
Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings!
He showed her his cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?” She was correct as usual.
He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her.
Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.
Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
She thanked him with real pleasure.
In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
For the first time she felt the influence of Spring.
His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?” “Ma buoni uomini.” He bowed.
Certainly.
Good men first, violets afterwards.
They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker.
They were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces.
He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant boughs.
She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.
Not a step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?” There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.
The voice of Mr.
Eager?
He shrugged his shoulders.
An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge.
She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen.
The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
Light and beauty enveloped her.
She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.” She did not answer.
From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view, and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam.
But never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival.
For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.
He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves.
The bushes above them closed.
He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called, “Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.
What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was slow to discover.
Mr.
Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk.
Mr. Emerson, seeking his son, was told whereabouts to find him.
Mr. Beebe, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the return home.
There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment.
Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics.
Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise.
Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett.
Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager.
Mr. Emerson had lost George.
Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square.
Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable.
He climbed on to the box shivering, with his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather.
“Let us go immediately,” he told them.
“The signorino will walk.” “All the way?
He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently.
I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.
He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence.
He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.
He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also.
Not so these English.
They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents, but infinitely the least dangerous.
Once back in the town, he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more.
Of course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it.
But after all, what have we to do with taverns?
Real menace belongs to the drawing-room.
It was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun.
Lucy sat beside her; Mr.
Eager sat opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious.
They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together.
The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol.
There was a lightning flash, and Miss Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front.
At the next flash, Lucy screamed also.
Mr.
Eager addressed her professionally: “Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith.
If I might say so, there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements.
Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?” “No—of course—” “Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous.
The steel knives, the only articles which might attract the current, are in the other carriage.
And, in any case, we are infinitely safer than if we were walking.
Courage—courage and faith.” Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand.
At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles, gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr.
Eager!” called Mr. Beebe.
“We want your assistance.
Will you interpret for us?” “George!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way.
He may be killed.” “Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver is no help.
Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.” “He may be killed!” cried the old man.
“He may be killed!” “Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage.
“In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.” “What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr.
Eager know?” “Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing.
But—” she pointed at the driver—“_he_ knows everything.
Dearest, had we better?
Shall I?” She took out her purse.
“It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book, she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it.
As well this ending to his day as any.
But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road.
The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen.
If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt.
They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.
They descended from the carriages; they embraced each other.
It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them.
For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly.
In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike.
Miss Lavish calculated that, even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the accident.
Mr.
Eager mumbled a temperate prayer.
But the drivers, through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me.
Kiss me again.
Only you can understand me.
You warned me to be careful.
And I—I thought I was developing.” “Do not cry, dearest.
Take your time.” “I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse.
Once by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?” The thought disturbed her repentance.
As a matter of fact, the storm was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not.
One would always pray against that.” “He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that.
I simply slipped into those violets.
No, I want to be really truthful.
I am a little to blame.
I had silly thoughts.
The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.” “In a book?” “Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.” “And then?” “But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
Indeed, she had little more to learn.
With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her.
All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
“It is so hard to be absolutely truthful.” “Don’t be troubled, dearest.
Wait till you are calmer.
We will talk it over before bed-time in my room.” So they re-entered the city with hands clasped.
It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others.
The storm had ceased, and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son.
Mr. Beebe had regained good humour, and Mr.
Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish.
Charlotte alone she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening.
She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it.
All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be carefully laid before her cousin.
And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself.
I shan’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know what.” Miss Alan asked her to play.
She refused vehemently.
Music seemed to her the employment of a child.
She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own.
Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay.
In vain she tried to check, or at all events to accelerate, the tale.
It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach: “Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire.
Come into my room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.” With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the girl.
Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?” She was unprepared for the question.
It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything.
A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done?
A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.” The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door.
A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes.
She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?” “The driver?” “My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.” Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?” “I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.” “I, too, intend to judge him charitably.
But unfortunately I have met the type before.
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first?
Come here and listen to me.
I am only gathering it from his own remarks.
Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another?” “Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude.
There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish.
But we are no farther on with our question.
What do you propose to do?” An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it.
But—as you said—it is my affair.
Mine and his.” “And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?” “Certainly not.
There would be no difficulty.
Whatever you ask him he answers, yes or no; then it is over.
I have been frightened of him.
But now I am not one little bit.” “But we fear him for you, dear.
You are so young and inexperienced, you have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round.
This afternoon, for example, if I had not arrived, what would have happened?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?” “I hadn’t time to think.
You came.” “Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?” “I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off.
She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett.
“You will be seen from the road.” Lucy obeyed.
She was in her cousin’s power.
She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started.
Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man!
We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless.
There is Mr.
Eager, but you do not trust him.
Oh, for your brother!
He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.
Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead.
There are still left some men who can reverence woman.” As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and ranged them upon the pin cushion.
Then she blew into her gloves and said: “It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.” “What train?” “The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?” “At eight.” “Signora Bertolini would be upset.” “We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.” “I expect she will.
However, we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses’ hotel.
Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?” “Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained motionless and silent.
To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome.
Lucy, when admonished, began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte, who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly.
She knelt down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.
But she was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her, but needed her to love.
For it was in ominous tones that she said, after a long pause: “Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?” Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant.
Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: “Charlotte dear, what do you mean?
As if I have anything to forgive!” “You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
I know well how much I vex you at every turn.” “But no—” Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged martyr.
“Ah, but yes!
I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped.
I might have known it would not do.
You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you.
I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.” “Please—” “My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and were often able to leave me at home.
I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary.
You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.” “You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other, heart and soul.
They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own.
“Failed to make you happy; failed in my duty to your mother.
She has been so generous to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.” “But mother will understand.
It is not your fault, this trouble, and it isn’t a disaster either.” “It is my fault, it is a disaster.
She will never forgive me, and rightly.
For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish?” “Every right.” “When I was here for your sake?
If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you.
Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.” Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence.
There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.” The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her.
But in case she should blame you in any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to.
I will never speak of it either to her or to any one.” Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.
Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background.
George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually.
At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since, it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent.
She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed, for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love.
Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters.
Before she reached them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle.
Thus it was that, though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers.
She was still dressed.
It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved.
At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said: “I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.” Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr. Emerson.” His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true.
It can’t all be true.
I want not to be muddled.
I want to grow older quickly.” Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear.
You need all the rest you can get.” In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun.
They were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied.
A poet—none was present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room.
One—a boy of nineteen—was studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano.
From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him what she had written.
And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother.
“I tell you I’m getting fairly sick.” “For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
“Time they did.” “I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.” “It’s his third go, isn’t it?” “Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.” “I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy.
I don’t know how girls manage things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.” “Do you indeed, dear?
How interesting!” “I feel—never mind.” He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse.
I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’” “Yes, mother, you told me.
A jolly good letter.” “I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.
But—’” She stopped reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all.
He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth.
When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.” “Nor me.” “You?” Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?” “He asked me for my permission also.” She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir.
“Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?
What ever did you say?” “I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’” “What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come.
There they still are!” “I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.” “Peeping like that!
Can’t I look out of my own window?” But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves.
For a brief space they were silent.
Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave a nervous gulp.
“Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy.
He practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her?
And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.” “I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.” “I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth.
“There!
Fly into a stew!
I can’t help it—had to say it.
I had to say no.
He ought never to have asked me.” “Ridiculous child!” cried his mother.
“You think you’re so holy and truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit.
Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say?
I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?” “Oh, do keep quiet, mother!
I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.
I tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right.
But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.” “No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the subject, “I shall not keep quiet.
You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.” “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
“I only let out I didn’t like him.
I don’t hate him, but I don’t like him.
What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.” He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“I know his mother; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick the piano!
He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained dissatisfied.
She added: “And he has beautiful manners.” “I liked him till just now.
I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.” “Mr.
Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest.
“I don’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in.” “You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means.
He said: ‘Mr.
Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he meant.
He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking.
Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.” “You never can, dear.
But I can.
You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.” The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it.
But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust.
Cecil praised one too much for being athletic.
Was that it?
Cecil made one talk in one’s own way.
This tired one.
Was that it?
And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow’s cap.
Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself.
He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother.
“‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light.
She keeps that flat abominably—” “Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?” “Don’t interrupt so foolishly.
Where was I?
Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing.
I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything.
But I do not know—’” “Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation.
He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles.
Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds.
But it was transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald.
Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described.
He was medieval.
Like a Gothic statue.
Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism.
A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant.
And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!” “I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals.
They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.
We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the furniture.
“This is indeed a joyous day!
I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy.” “I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat.
She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis.
Then she saw her brother’s face.
Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?” Cecil suggested.
“And I’d stop here and tell my mother.” “We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.” They passed into the sunlight.
Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and descend out of sight by the steps.
They would descend—he knew their ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed, until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical.
He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s.
That day she had seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel.
But Italy worked some marvel in her.
It gave her light, and—which he held more precious—it gave her shadow.
Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence.
She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness.
Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other.
It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the same to him as before.
Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language.
She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her.
He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
The things that really mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy.
His mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he moved to the writing table.
There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many erasures.
He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.
With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table.
The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter.
He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about it none the less.
It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected.
“I represent all that he despises.
Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?” The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
“Mr.
Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse.
Do you suppose that I shall get it?” “I should say so.
Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.” “Pfui!” “I know,” said Cecil.
“I know.
I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.” For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip.
Isn’t this news?” “News?
I don’t understand you,” said Cecil.
“News?” Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field.
He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!” “Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself.
Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen!
Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
But his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question!
To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church!
I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.” “I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly.
“I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board.
Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the right names.
I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery.
It is very remiss of me.
Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.” Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?” “I have no profession,” said Cecil.
“It is another example of my decadence.
My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
I know I ought to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.” “You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe.
“It is a wonderful opportunity, the possession of leisure.” His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally.
He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve.
I daren’t face the healthy person—for example, Freddy Honeychurch.” “Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?” “Admirable.
The sort who has made England what she is.” Cecil wondered at himself.
Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly contrary?
He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea before evening service.” “I suppose Anne never told them you were here.
In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives.
The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?” “I know the faults of Mary.
She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.” “The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small.” They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many.
No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.” “She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree.
At present she has none.” “At present?” “I’m not cynical.
I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle.
Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.” Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?” “Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps.
Oh, I forgot; of course, you knew her before.
No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.” “In what way?” Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string.
Picture number two: the string breaks.” The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically.
At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?” “No.
I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.” “It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst.
He cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken?
What do you mean?” “I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.” The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize.
I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners.
Was this the reception his action would get from the world?
Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly.
“I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.” “Not that.
But you ought to have stopped me.
I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes.
Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with any one; certainly not with you.” “You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?” Mr. Beebe pulled himself together.
Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions.
He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet.
I foresaw at Florence that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended.
I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio.
He did not omit to do so.
“She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her.” “Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?” Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march.
Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried.
He looked at Lucy.
In her presence he could not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.
I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great and small.
I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and mother.
And now I want my tea.” “You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted.
“How dare you be serious at Windy Corner?” He took his tone from her.
There was no more heavy beneficence, no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures.
None of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe.
Away from it, in the solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical.
But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious.
It has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart.
The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed.
Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel sentimental.
Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.
If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true.
Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them greatly.
They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door.
Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance.
Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as a mother-in-law.
As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him.
People congratulated Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid.
They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with the dowagers.
When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?” “I suppose so.
Mother, would it be?” “Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and said: “To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.” “I am so sorry that you were stranded.” “Not that, but the congratulations.
It is so disgusting, the way an engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment.
All those old women smirking!” “One has to go through it, I suppose.
They won’t notice us so much next time.” “But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong.
An engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and should be treated as such.” Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially correct.
The spirit of the generations had smiled through them, rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth.
To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite different—personal love.
Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said.
“Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?” “I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public.
The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic.
Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato.” “Inglese Italianato?” “E un diavolo incarnato!
You know the proverb?” She did not.
Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother.
But Cecil, since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.” “We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?” “It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in, or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?” She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert.
“I don’t see any difference.
Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same place.” “We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap.
“This is me.
That’s Windy Corner.
The rest of the pattern is the other people.
Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.” She leant placidly back.
Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and that’s Mr. Beebe.” “A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.” Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect what they meant.
She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried.
“I consider him far above the average.
I only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful ones, is Mr.
Eager, the English chaplain at Florence.
He was truly insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate.
He was a snob, and so conceited, and he did say such unkind things.” “What sort of things?” “There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife.” “Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing.
Mr.
Eager would never come to the point.
He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.” “Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander?
It was, I believe, chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped.
People pretended he was vulgar, but he certainly wasn’t that.” “Poor old man!
What was his name?” “Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr.
Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know.
I hate him.
I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto.
I hate him.
Nothing can hide a petty nature.
I _hate_ him.” “My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“You’ll blow my head off!
Whatever is there to shout over?
I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen.” He smiled.
There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s moral outburst over Mr.
Eager.
It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine.
He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not in muscular rant.
But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive.
After a moment, he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval.
He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.
He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.
The outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact.
Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I feel I could never live out of it.
When I’m in the country I feel the same about the country.
After all, I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who live amongst them must be the best.
It’s true that in nine cases out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything.
The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions.
Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town.
Do you feel that, Mrs. Honeychurch?” Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled.
She had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either.
Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics.
It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?” “‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?” “Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled spire.
Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church.
In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages.
Some great mansions were at hand, but they were hidden in the trees.
The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement, having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals.
“Albert” was inhabited.
His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace.
“Cissie” was to let.
Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically.
“Summer Street will never be the same again.” As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry.
Now we shall know.
Sir Harry, pull those things down at once!” Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I meant to.
I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss Flack.” “Am I not always right?
She ought to have gone before the contract was signed.
Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s time?” “But what can I do?” He lowered his voice.
“An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden.” “Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully.
He had had full warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory.
He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt.
Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper.
He ventured to differ, however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration.
Sir Harry hinted that a column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin.
He built his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage.
He had failed in his duties to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy landlord.
But it is such an awkward size.
It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.” Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them.
The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously.
“It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.” “Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly.
“That is exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong type of people.
The train service has improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind.
And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?” “Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate.
She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea.
How would you like spinsters?” “My dear Lucy, it would be splendid.
Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.
I heard from them last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.
I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people.
Mr. Beebe knows them, too.
May I tell them to write to you?” “Indeed you may!” he cried.
“Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
How delightful it is!
Extra facilities—please tell them they shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees.
Oh, the agents!
The appalling people they have sent me!
One woman, when I wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance.
As if one cares about that!
And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable.
And oh, the deceit!
I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week.
The deceit of the most promising people.
My dear Lucy, the deceit!” She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all.
I know the type.
Preserve me from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy.
It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down.” “I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very sad thing.” “The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil.
“I haven’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.” “Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.” “It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied.
“I oughtn’t to come with my troubles to young people.
But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no real help.” “Then may I write to my Misses Alan?” “Please!” But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed: “Beware!
They are certain to have canaries.
Sir Harry, beware of canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come.
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.” “Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
If they get drunk, there’s an end of them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off.
If they’re vulgar, they somehow keep it to themselves.
It doesn’t spread so.
Give me a man—of course, provided he’s clean.” Sir Harry blushed.
Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex.
Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction.
He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself.
She was delighted.
Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house.
Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?” “Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.
He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha!
young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!” “I can’t help it.
It would be wrong not to loathe that man.” “He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.” “No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life.
In London he would keep his place.
He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife would give brainless dinner parties.
But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and every one—even your mother—is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt discouraged.
“I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.” “It matters supremely.
Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!
How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
with his bald head and retreating chin!
But let’s forget him.” This Lucy was glad enough to do.
If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape?
For instance, Freddy.
Freddy was neither clever, nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”?
And what would she reply?
Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety enough.
She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps, during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them.
Summer Street lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
“Why is it, Lucy, that you always say the road?
Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?” “Haven’t I?
The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with me in a room.” “A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes.
Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road.
Never in the real country like this.” “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
I have never felt anything of the sort.
You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.” “I don’t know that you aren’t.
I connect you with a view—a certain type of view.
Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?” She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing: “Do you know that you’re right?
I do.
I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room.
How funny!” To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray?
With no view?” “Yes, with no view, I fancy.
Why not?” “I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open air.” She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?” As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees.
She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!” “Why do you call it that?” “I can’t remember why.
I suppose it comes out of some book.
It’s only a puddle now, but you see that stream going through it?
Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful.
Then Freddy used to bathe there.
He is very fond of it.” “And you?” He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed here, too, till I was found out.
Then there was a row.” At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of prudishness within him.
But now?
with his momentary cult of the fresh air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity.
He looked at her as she stood by the pool’s edge.
She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?” “Charlotte,” she murmured.
“She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.” “Poor girl!” She smiled gravely.
A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
“What, Cecil?” “Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me—” He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed.
His courage had gone.
“Yes?” “Up to now I have never kissed you.” She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?” “Of course, you may, Cecil.
You might before.
I can’t run at you, you know.” At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities.
Her reply was inadequate.
She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil.
As he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them.
Such was the embrace.
He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure.
Passion should believe itself irresistible.
It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young man behind the counter would have done?
He recast the scene.
Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness.
For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation.
He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts.
At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.” “What name?” “The old man’s.” “What old man?” “That old man I told you about.
The one Mr.
Eager was so unkind to.” He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had.
Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to.
Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself.
Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs.
Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy.
He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility.
“I cannot think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter.
When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.
The best obtainable.
Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles.
A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia.
Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes.
In this circle, one thought, married, and died.
Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills.
But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high.
You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you.
She returned with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation.
He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad.
He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
Nor did he realize a more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her.
A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved.
For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.” “But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe.
“I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably.
They are coming.
I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried.
“Just because they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing.
And poor Lucy—serve her right—worn to a shadow.” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court.
Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn.
When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring.
“If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count.
I told you not Saturn.” “Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.” “Saturn doesn’t bounce.” “Saturn bounces enough.” “No, he doesn’t.” “Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.” “Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in.
That’s right, Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over the shins!” Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness.
Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt.
He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
But he hated the physical violence of the young.
How right it was!
Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.” “That wasn’t the name—” Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.” “Nonsense, Freddy!
You know nothing about it.” “Nonsense yourself!
I’ve this minute seen him.
He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem!
ahem!
I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’ and slapped him on the back.” “Exactly.
The Miss Alans?” “Rather not.
More like Anderson.” “Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed.
“Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right?
I _said_ don’t interfere with Cissie Villa.
I’m always right.
I’m quite uneasy at being always right so often.” “It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s.
Freddy doesn’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.” “Yes, I do.
I’ve got it.
Emerson.” “What name?” “Emerson.
I’ll bet you anything you like.” “What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly.
“I wish I had never bothered over it at all.” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky.
Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy?
Do you know what Emersons they are?” “I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was democratic.
Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person.
All right, Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother’s a snob.
But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s affectation to pretend there isn’t.” “Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways.
Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man.
Pray, does that satisfy you?” “Oh, yes,” he grumbled.
“And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety.” “_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly.
“Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.” “But has Cecil—” “Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’” She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much.
While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl.
She might well “screech” when she heard that it came partly from her lover.
Mr. Vyse was a tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people.
The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
He diverted it as follows: “The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean?
No, I don’t suppose it will prove to be them.
It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse’s.
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people!
The queerest people!
For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets.
They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa.
Poor little ladies!
So shocked and so pleased.
It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories.
‘My dear sister loves flowers,’ it began.
They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult.
Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets.” “Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister’s face was very red.
She could not recover herself.
Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature—pessimism, et cetera.
Our special joy was the father—such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.
He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Lucy, don’t desert us—go on playing bumble-puppy.
Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place.
That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being there.
Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop?
By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time.” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer.
He suggested that his hostess was mistaken.
At the hint of opposition she warmed.
She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told.
The name escaped her.
What was the name?
Oh, what was the name?
She clasped her knees for the name.
Something in Thackeray.
She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely.
“Don’t be silly.
You always overdo it when you play.” As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
Hitherto truth had come to her naturally.
She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely truthful?
Well, at all events, she must not tell lies.
She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame.
A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.
“Cecil!” “Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window.
He seemed in high spirits.
“I was hoping you’d come.
I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse.
George Meredith’s right—the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa.
Don’t be angry!
Don’t be angry!
You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.” He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said.
“Freddy has told us.
Naughty Cecil!
I suppose I must forgive you.
Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have nice friends of yours.
But you oughtn’t to tease one so.” “Friends of mine?” he laughed.
“But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was.
“Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week.” “What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously.
“I don’t quite understand.” “In the Umbrian Room.
Absolute strangers.
They were admiring Luca Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly.
However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not a little.
They had been to Italy.” “But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends.
I thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—” “Cecil!
No, it’s not fair.
I’ve probably met them before—” He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair.
Anything is fair that punishes a snob.
That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good.
Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with me.
There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things.
I believe in democracy—” “No, you don’t,” she snapped.
“You don’t know what the word means.” He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque.
“No, you don’t!” Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil.
I blame you—I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous.
You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense?
I consider it most disloyal of you.” She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness.
As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded.
He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally.
He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent.
In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse.
His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch.
Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement, met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned.
The Miss Alans were duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held responsible for the failure.
Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived.
Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood.
And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood.
Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood.
But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done.
She was glad that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative.
He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy.
At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do!
I don’t know what I should do without you.” Several days passed.
Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett.
A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not corresponded since they parted in August.
The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased amazingly.
For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical.
Charlotte, unselfish in the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue their tour.
Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs.
Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly.
Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS, “_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA, “I have news of you at last!
Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome.
Puncturing her tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out.
He said his father had just taken the house.
He _said_ he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (?).
He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea.
Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him to enter the house, etc.
That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you have told them already.
Mr. Vyse is so sensitive.
I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome.
I am very sorry about it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me, “Your anxious and loving cousin, “CHARLOTTE.” Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows: “BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE, “Many thanks for your warning.
When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she would blame you for not being always with me.
I have kept that promise, and cannot possibly tell her now.
I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself.
She should have tried at the Rectory.
I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage.
You must see that it would be too absurd.
If the Emersons heard I had complained of them, they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they are not.
I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy Corner at all, but here.
Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your envelope again.
No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately, “L.
M. HONEYCHURCH.” Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not.
Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at?
Miss Bartlett suggested the former.
Perhaps she was right.
It had become a great thing now.
Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago.
She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school.
But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.
It did her no harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors.
The weather was cool, and it did her no harm.
In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people.
The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.
One was tired of everything, it seemed.
One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter.
In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann.
“Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the querulous beauty of the music had died.
She shook her head and played Schumann again.
The melody rose, unprofitably magical.
It broke; it was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave.
The sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of the audience throb.
Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s, had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among many people.
The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.” “Her music always was wonderful.” “Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean.
She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.” “Italy has done it.” “Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her.
“It is just possible.
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.” “But her music!” he exclaimed.
“The style of her!
How she kept to Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schumann was right for this evening.
Schumann was the thing.
Do you know, mother, I shall have our children educated just like Lucy.
Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then—not till then—let them come to London.
I don’t believe in these London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.” “Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s room.
Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself.
She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.” “Bad dreams?” “Just dreams.” The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You should have heard us talking about you, dear.
He admires you more than ever.
Dream of that.” Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed.
Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed.
As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.” “M’m.” “They might amuse you.” Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe.
“They are worth it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
“Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!” “I’ve brought someone to see you.” “I’ll be down in a minute.” The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered.
“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment.
What have they got?
Byron.
Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad.
Never heard of it.
The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it.
Gibbon.
Hullo!
dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.” “Mr.
Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.” “I know.
Isn’t it jolly?
I like that.
I’m certain that’s the old man’s doing.” “How very odd of him!” “Surely you agree?” But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.” “The same as Lucy’s got.” “Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?” “She came back yesterday.” “I suppose she had a good time?” “Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book.
“She and Cecil are thicker than ever.” “That’s good hearing.” “I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.” Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks.
She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books.
Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
Cecil says—” “What on earth are those people doing upstairs?
Emerson—we think we’ll come another time.” George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.” Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face wanted washing.
At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe.” “Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do?
how d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard.
But I’m afraid it will only act between men.
Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How do you do?
Come and have a bathe’?
And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.” “I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.
I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.” “We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you place in the past, is really yet to come.
We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.” Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead.
We despise the body less than women do.
But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.” “I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once.
But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
It is our heritage.” “Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.” “How do you do?
Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty.
I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He has been most kind.
He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
Ah, this wind!
You do well to bathe.
Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!” “Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy.
“I must—that is to say, I have to—have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.” “_Call_, my lad?
Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
Call on your grandmother!
Listen to the wind among the pines!
Yours is a glorious country.” Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr.
Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval.
It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, George.
Why do you dawdle talking?
Bring them back to tea.
Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his office.
I can’t believe he’s well.” George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him.
“It is only a pond, don’t you know.
I dare say you are used to something better.” “Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.” Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
How glorious it was!
For a little time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
He spoke of Florence.
George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse!
Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?” “I did not.
Miss Lavish told me.” “When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of Coincidence.’” No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.” To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is.
I have reflected.
It is Fate.
Everything is Fate.
We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart.
The twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—” “You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman.
“Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
Don’t say, ‘I didn’t do this,’ for you did it, ten to one.
Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?” “Italy.” “And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?” “National Gallery.” “Looking at Italian art.
There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.” “It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George.
“But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.” Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is still to write.” Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that you have come.” Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond.
I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe.
“No apologies are necessary for the pond.” George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid?
I love willow-herb in seed.
What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
Very charming, very charming.” “Mr.
Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George.
Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
It was necessary to use his muscles.
It was necessary to keep clean.
Mr. Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful, water’s simply ripping.” “Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful.
Mr. Beebe, do.” “Apooshoo, kouf.” Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
How glorious it was!
The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Götterdämmerung.
But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
They began to play.
Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
A little deferentially, they splashed George.
He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: “No.
We are what matters.
Without us shall no enterprise begin.
To us shall all flesh turn in the end.” “A try!
A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a kick.
“Goal!” “Goal!” “Pass!” “Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat!
No, that’s enough, Freddy.
Dress now.
No, I say!” But the two young men were delirious.
Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
“Hi!
Steady on!
I see people coming you fellows!” Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi!
hi!
_Ladies!_” Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
Still, they did not hear Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Whoever were those unfortunate people?
Oh, dears, look away!
And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?” “Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
Cecil, Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—” No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently “minded.” “I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.” “This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.” They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
“I can’t be trodden on, can I?” “Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you!
What miserable management!
Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?” “Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and if another fellow—” “Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
Come, Lucy.” They turned.
“Oh, look—don’t look!
Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
How unfortunate again—” For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken.
“I’ve swallowed a pollywog.
It wriggleth in my tummy.
I shall die—Emerson you beast, you’ve got on my bags.” “Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
“And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.” “Mother, do come away,” said Lucy.
“Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.” “Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed.
Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called: “Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
Hullo!” “Bow, Lucy; better bow.
Whoever is it?
I shall bow.” Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away.
On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for youth.
Chapter XIII How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview!
But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume.
Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent.
She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life.
A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much.
“I will bow,” she had thought.
“I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom?
To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.
It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.
Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and he did not want to be seen.
He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside.
He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done.
Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock.
Miss Bartlett, indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory.
Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with Cecil?” The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.” “Perhaps he’s tired.” Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.” “I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.” “Cecil has told you to think so.
You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.” “Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?” “Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?” “Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble ahead.
“It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him sometimes seem—” “Oh, rubbish!
If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother!
I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!” “Not in that way.
At times I could wring her neck.
But not in that way.
No.
It is the same with Cecil all over.” “By-the-by—I never told you.
I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London.” This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me.
No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.” “I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to.
But he does not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.” “Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?” “You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.” “Then why didn’t he leave the room?
Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone’s pleasure?” “We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy.
Something had enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form.
The two civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes.
Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he had succeeded.
And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother—” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
Go.” She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window.
It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.
Now, as in the winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes.
One connected the landing window with depression.
No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly.
And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.
She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.” “My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been!
You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public.
It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else.
Do be more careful.
You forget the place is growing half suburban.” “I say, is anything on to-morrow week?” “Not that I know of.” “Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.” “Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.” “What’s wrong with the court?
They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered new balls.” “I meant _it’s_ better not.
I really mean it.” He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper.
Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans.
Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making!
I have something to say to you.
Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes.
I really can’t stop.
I must dress too.” “How’s Charlotte?” “All right.” “Lucy!” The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?” “Her _what?_” “Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?” “I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly.
“I shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.” Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out.
She did not.
She said: “Come here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life.
It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil.
Cecil despised their methods—perhaps rightly.
At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven.
Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
Then Freddy said: “Lucy, what’s Emerson like?” “I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?” “Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.” “He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly.
I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.” “Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter.” “One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie.
“Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.” “Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.” “She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily.
The remark was a happy one, for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print.
Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath.
But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness.
There were too many ghosts about.
The original ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr.
Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes.
It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s.
How is she?” “I tore the thing up.” “Didn’t she say how she was?
How does she sound?
Cheerful?” “Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.” “Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler.
I know myself how water preys upon one’s mind.
I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the meat.” Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish.
I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long.” It was more than her nerves could stand.
And she could not protest violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded.
“It’s impossible.
We can’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is.
Freddy’s got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare.
It simply can’t be done.” “Nonsense!
It can.” “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
Not otherwise.” “Minnie can sleep with you.” “I won’t have her.” “Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.” “Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy.
“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.” “No, I don’t.
And no more does Cecil.
She gets on our nerves.
You haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good.
So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come.” “Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two.
You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers.
You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.” Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike,” put in Freddy.
“She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.” “I know, dear.
She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return.” But Lucy hardened her heart.
It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She had tried herself too often and too recently.
One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth.
She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother.
I don’t like Charlotte.
I admit it’s horrid of me.” “From your own account, you told her as much.” “Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
She flurried—” The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the places she had known as a child.
The Sacred Lake would never be the same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner.
How would she fight against ghosts?
For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care for eggs.
I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.” Cecil frowned again.
Oh, these Honeychurches!
Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact.
“May me and Lucy get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.” Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room—something with no view, anything.
Her love to Lucy.
And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
She never gazed inwards.
If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
She was nervous at night.
When she talked to George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
Once she had suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious.
Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
She loved Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
Standing between Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his crudities in time.
I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.” Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits.
He laughs more.” “Yes,” replied the clergyman.
“He is waking up.” That was all.
But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs. Honeychurch drove to meet her.
She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“I have upset everything.
Bursting in on young people!
But I insist on paying for my cab up.
Grant that, at any rate.” “Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.” “I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather.
Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.” Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
Only sovereigns and pennies.
Could any one give her change?
Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But who am I to give the sovereign to?” “Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.” Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid.
A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
I should practically be robbing the one who lost.” “Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil.
“So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.” “Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
“How is that, Mr. Vyse?” “Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab.
Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.” Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy.
He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
“I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid.” “Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.” “But I don’t see—” They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you.
I’m done.
I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me.
Ow!
What about Mr. Floyd’s ten shillings?
Ow!
No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.” “I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
“Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
A shilling was it?
Can any one give me change for half a crown?” “I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign.
No, give me up that sovereign.
I’ll get Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning.” “Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?” “No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
“Let me see—a sovereign’s worth of silver.” She escaped into the kitchen.
Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were too uncanny.
It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t.
Here is your money—all shillings, except two half-crowns.
Would you count it?
You can settle your debt nicely now.” Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source.” “Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle.
“George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?” Miss Bartlett considered.
“For instance, the driver.
I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.” Lucy shuddered a little.
“We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren’t careful.
How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?” “We must think of every possibility.” “Oh, it’s all right.” “Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows.
In fact, he is certain to know.” “I don’t care if he does.
I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.” “To contradict it?” “No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best.
Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
Ladies are certainly different.” “Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully.
“You kind, anxious thing.
What _would_ you have me do?
First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say, ‘Tell’.
Which is it to be?
Quick!” Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest.
I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
You will never forgive me.” “Shall we go out, then.
They will smash all the china if we don’t.” For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again.
Have you seen the young one yet?” “Yes, I have.” “What happened?” “We met at the Rectory.” “What line is he taking up?” “No line.
He talked about Italy, like any other person.
It is really all right.
What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way.
He really won’t be any nuisance, Charlotte.” “Once a cad, always a cad.
That is my poor opinion.” Lucy paused.
“Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
It was a new one from Smith’s library.
Her mother must have returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
I don’t think we ought to blame him very much.
It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
He has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into tears.
He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big railways—not a porter!
and runs down to his father for week-ends.
Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
There!
Now for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm.
“Suppose we don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.” Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
Explanations took place, and in the midst of them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain.
Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most of the days of that year.
In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold.
Up on the heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.
Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path.
From the house came incoherent sounds, as of females preparing for worship.
“The men say they won’t go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her, no nonsense”—“Anne!
Mary!
Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine.
Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously.
The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender shadow.
But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window.
Her new cerise dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan.
At her throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an engagement ring.
Her eyes are bent to the Weald.
She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.
In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills.
“Lucy!
Lucy!
What’s that book?
Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?” “It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.” “But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.” Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a Loggia.
She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up.
It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil had said, “What!
you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?” She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.
I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child?
Minnie!
That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!)
Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late.
Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse, never the carriage.
“Where’s Charlotte?
Run up and hurry her.
Why is she so long?
She had nothing to do.
She never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses!
Minnie!” Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting.
As usual, she didn’t see why.
Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men?
The young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words.
Mrs. Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but sovereigns and half crowns.
Could any one give me—” “Yes, easily.
Jump in.
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock!
You put us all to shame.” “If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully.
She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse.
The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
“Good-bye!
Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering.
On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation.
He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.
All that he said on this subject pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church.
There was a line of carriages down the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa.
To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother.
“Unless the young man considers that he knows me already.” He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally.
Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how glad he was that she was going to be married.
She said yes, she was glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice; she had never known him offended before.
He added: “We find, though, that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing.
I am very much upset about it.” “I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,” said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further.
“He thought we should be artistic.
He is disappointed.” “And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up.
What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly.
She must avoid censuring Cecil.
For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned, though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says.
He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall.
Yet it does seem so unkind.” “There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“That’s exactly what I say.
Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?” “There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,” he continued in measured tones.
“We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.
Choose a place where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!” “Eh—?” “I see you’re going to be clever.
I hope you didn’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy.” George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
“He behaved that way to me.
It is his philosophy.
Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first.” “What _do_ you mean?
No, never mind what you mean.
Don’t explain.
He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
Do you play tennis?
Do you mind tennis on Sunday—?” “George mind tennis on Sunday!
George, after his education, distinguish between Sunday—” “Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.
No more do I. That’s settled.
Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased.” He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans.” “I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck.
The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the morning sun?
She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.” “Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady.
Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow.
It was the pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow.
Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered.
He said: “I—I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house.
Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them.
“George has been in such good spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.” Lucy caught her cousin’s eye.
Something in its mute appeal made her reckless.
“Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven.
Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy.
All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things.
It was not an exploit.
He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her hand to her cheek.
“He does not love me.
No.
How terrible if he did!
But he has not told.
He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right.
It’s a secret between us two for ever.
Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room.
The secret, big or little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world.
Thus she interpreted her joy.
She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so safe.
As he helped her out of the carriage, she said: “The Emersons have been so nice.
George Emerson has improved enormously.” “How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them, and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth.
For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected.
He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are.
George Emerson is coming up this afternoon.
He is a most interesting man to talk to.
Only don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks.
Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal.
Generally Lucy was depressed at meals.
Some one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will not last, this cheerfulness.
In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee.
Her mother would always sit there, her brother here.
The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would never be hidden behind the western hills.
After luncheon they asked her to play.
She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.
Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.” She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round.
There George was.
He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
Cecil should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson.
Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.
She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano.
“I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.” “Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil.
“I will not spoil the set.” He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil.
I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s Emerson.” George corrected him: “I am not bad.” One looked down one’s nose at this.
“Then certainly I won’t play,” said Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse.
You had much better not play.
Much better not.” Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would play.
“I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall back on Lucy.
There is no other way out of it.
Lucy, go and change your frock.” Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature.
She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon.
As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner.
She liked music, but how much better tennis seemed.
How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms.
Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child.
George served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
The hills stood out above its radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara.
She might be forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her.
He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others.
He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke.
When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.” “What fun, Cecil!
Read away.
Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!” “Do you mind being beaten?” She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a splendid player, though.
The light was behind you, and it was in my eyes.” “I never said I was.” “Why, you did!” “You didn’t attend.” “You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house.
We all exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.” “‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset.
Leonora was speeding—’” Lucy interrupted.
“Leonora?
Is Leonora the heroine?
Who’s the book by?” “Joseph Emery Prank.
‘Sunset.
Leonora speeding across the square.
Pray the saints she might not arrive too late.
Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it now—’” Lucy burst into laughter.
“‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed!
Why it’s Miss Lavish!
It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under somebody else’s name.” “Who may Miss Lavish be?” “Oh, a dreadful person—Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?” Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up.
“Of course I do.
I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street.
It was she who told me that you lived here.” “Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean something else.
She watched his head, which was almost resting against her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening.
“No wonder the novel’s bad,” she added.
“I never liked Miss Lavish.
But I suppose one ought to read it as one’s met her.” “All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature.
“Every one writes for money in these days.” “Oh, Cecil—!” “It is so.
I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow.
The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her.
She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?” “I never notice much difference in views.” “What do you mean?” “Because they’re all alike.
Because all that matters in them is distance and air.” “H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.” “I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up.
Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.” He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured.
“I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again.
I’m so sorry he’s not so well.” “No, he isn’t well.” “There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil.
“Also that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.” “Mr.
Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?” “None.
Why?” “You spoke of ‘us.’” “My mother, I was meaning.” Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!” “I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” “I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.
It is the first thing that I remember.” Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after tennis—he didn’t do.
He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.” “Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.” “No—read away.
I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud.
If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.” This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him.
It put their visitor in the position of a prig.
Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr.
Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book.
Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked.
But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning.
“Find me chapter two, if it isn’t bothering you.” Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.” She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.” He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone.
Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village.
The season was spring.’” Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose, for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read.
He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence, while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets.
All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’” Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use.
No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’” “This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last.
She thought a disaster was averted.
But when they entered the shrubbery it came.
The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring.
That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove.
Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I must write some letters,” and went up to her room.
Then she prepared for action.
Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty.
Perhaps there never is such a contest.
It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first aim was to defeat herself.
As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been.
Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him.
The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.
In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
“Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?” Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.
“There is a scene in it.
The hero and heroine make love.
Do you know about that?” “Dear—?” “Do you know about it, please?” she repeated.
“They are on a hillside, and Florence is in the distance.” “My good Lucia, I am all at sea.
I know nothing about it whatever.” “There are violets.
I cannot believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her?
I have thought before speaking; it _must_ be you.” “Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.” Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved.
“Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t put that in her book?” Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it.
Yes.” “Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” “So you did tell?” “I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of conversation—” “But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell mother?” “I will never forgive Eleanor.
She has betrayed my confidence.” “Why did you tell her, though?
This is a most serious thing.” Why does any one tell anything?
The question is eternal, and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response.
She had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again.
Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes?
Behind Cecil’s back as we were walking up the garden.” Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now?
Can you tell me?” “Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day.
Fancy if your prospects—” “I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word.
“I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.” It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince.
“However,” said the girl, despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done.
You have put me in a most awkward position.
How am I to get out of it?” Miss Bartlett could not think.
The days of her energy were over.
She was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that.
She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him?
I can’t tell mother now—owing to you.
Nor Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you.
I am caught up every way.
I think I shall go mad.
I have no one to help me.
That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.” Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing.
What’s to be _done?_ We women go maundering on.
What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?” “I always said he was a cad, dear.
Give me credit for that, at all events.
From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a bath.” “Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong!
We’ve both made a muddle of it.
George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he to be left unpunished, or isn’t he?
I want to know.” Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless.
Her own exposure had unnerved her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain.
She moved feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?” “Willingly would I move heaven and earth—” “I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously.
“Will you speak to him?
It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word.” “Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.” “It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture.
“No one will help me.
I will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below.
“Found the lost ball?
Good man!
Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you!
I admire you—” They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul.
Her anger faded at the sight of him.
Ah!
The Emersons were fine people in their way.
She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying: “Freddy has taken him into the dining-room.
The others are going down the garden.
Come.
Let us get this over quickly.
Come.
I want you in the room, of course.” “Lucy, do you mind doing it?” “How can you ask such a ridiculous question?” “Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand.
“I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded.
She remembered their last evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss Bartlett’s toque on the door.
She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time.
Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying.
“The jam’s jolly good.” George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room.
As she entered he stopped, and said: “No—nothing to eat.” “You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants.
Where’s mother?” “She’s started on her Sunday writing.
She’s in the drawing-room.” “That’s all right.
You go away.” He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table.
Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech.
She just said: “I can’t have it, Mr. Emerson.
I cannot even talk to you.
Go out of this house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door.
“I hate a row.
Go please.” “What—” “No discussion.” “But I can’t—” She shook her head.
“Go, please.
I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.” “You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t mean that you are going to marry that man?” The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her.
“You are merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse.
He’s only for an acquaintance.
He is for society and cultivated talk.
He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.” It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss—” “No, but have you ever?
He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.
It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.
I would never have let myself go.
But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters.
Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.
That is the man all over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find.
Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to settle whether you were shocked or no.
Cecil all over again.
He daren’t let a woman decide.
He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.
Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon.
Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’ because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control.
I’m not ashamed.
I don’t apologize.
But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you.
Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly?
But therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.” Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson.
Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.” And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality.
He said: “Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary.
“I’m the same kind of brute at bottom.
This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He thought.
“Yes—really in a better way.
I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards her.
“Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain.
I have cared for you since that man died.
I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun.
As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered.
I called.
I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.” “And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm.
“Does he not matter?
That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly?
A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?” He said: “It is our last chance.
I shall do all that I can.” And as if he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening.
“You wouldn’t stop us this second time if you understood,” he said.
“I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.” Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though demolishing some invisible obstacle.
She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
“It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really.
It is that love and youth matter intellectually.” In silence the two women watched him.
His last remark, they knew, was nonsense, but was he going after it or not?
Would not he, the cad, the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish?
No.
He was apparently content.
He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house.
Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!” Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet.
“Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the latter.
One more fuss through with you, Charlotte.
Many thanks.
I think, though, that this is the last.
My admirer will hardly trouble me again.” And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish: “Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it?
Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really.
It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.” “Let’s go down to them.” But, once in the open air, she paused.
Some emotion—pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring.
That something or other mattered intellectually?
A leaf, violently agitated, danced past her, while other leaves lay motionless.
That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy!
There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll hurry.” “Mr.
Emerson has had to go.” “What a nuisance!
That spoils the four.
I say, Cecil, do play, do, there’s a good chap.
It’s Floyd’s last day.
Do play tennis with us, just this once.” Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete.
As you well remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you.” The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes.
How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement.
Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered.
He had nothing to say.
He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things over.
We are too different.
I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.” It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—” “I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
“My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.” “I don’t understand you.
You aren’t like yourself.
You’re tired, Lucy.” “Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once.
“That is exactly like you.
You always think women don’t mean what they say.” “Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.” “What if I do?
It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth.
I can’t marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.” “You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches.
But give me a moment’s time.” He closed his eyes.
“You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.” It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
To bring on the crisis, she said: “There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.” “I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never could play.
I don’t understand a word you say.” “You can play well enough to make up a four.
I thought it abominably selfish of you.” “No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis.
Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
You talked of our wedding at lunch—at least, you let me talk.” “I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly.
“I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
Of course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.” She developed this position.
“Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted to be my husband?
I don’t think so.
You don’t like Freddy, nor my mother.
There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point.
They have to-day.
I see clearly.
I must speak.
That’s all.” “I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently.
“I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
It’s all too horrible.” “What’s the good of a scene?” “No good.
But surely I have a right to hear a little more.” He put down his glass and opened the window.
From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy or any one might be outside.” He obeyed.
“I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved me!” “I did not,” she said.
“I thought I did at first.
I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.” He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
She had counted on his being petty.
It would have made things easier for her.
By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently.
I dare say you are right not to.
But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.” “Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort who can’t know any one intimately.” A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that.
But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
It is that, more or less.
When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always protecting me.” Her voice swelled.
“I won’t be protected.
I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
To shield me is an insult.
Can’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
A woman’s place!
You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
That’s why I break off my engagement.
You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause.
Then Cecil said with great emotion: “It is true.” “True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word.
It is a revelation.
It is—I.” “Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.” He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true.
I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
You are even greater than I thought.” She withdrew a step.
“I’m not going to worry you.
You are far too good to me.
I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
I have never known you till this evening.
I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—” “What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance.
She cried: “If you think I am in love with some one else, you are very much mistaken.” “Of course I don’t think that.
You are not that kind, Lucy.” “Oh, yes, you do think it.
It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting, brutal!
As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.” He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past.
I shall never say it again.
You have taught me better.” She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity.
I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.” “All right, Cecil, that will do.
Don’t apologize to me.
It was my mistake.” “It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke.
“I must actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really am.
Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
Will you shake hands?” “Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
“Good-night, Cecil.
Good-bye.
That’s all right.
I’m sorry about it.
Thank you very much for your gentleness.” “Let me light your candle, shall I?” They went into the hall.
“Thank you.
Good-night again.
God bless you, Lucy!” “Good-bye, Cecil.” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry.
In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself.
She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within.
They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
As the years pass, they are censured.
Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one.
The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill.
On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy Corner,—he laughed.
The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.
The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road.
So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly.
Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.
One might laugh at the house, but one never shuddered.
Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip.
He had heard from the Miss Alans.
These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed their plans.
They were going to Greece instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter.
Of course, Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train.
But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.” Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her.
She would see the fun of it, and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty.
Though she was hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she could not play the piano as she did.
He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been understood.
This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been illustrated by facts.
Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.
Therefore it must be the horse, who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy.
They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs.
Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station.
They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it.
“Isn’t it wonderful?
Isn’t it romance?
Most certainly they will go to Constantinople.
They are taken in a snare that cannot fail.
They will end by going round the world.” Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious!
I never notice it in you young people; you do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing.
‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn!
No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans.
They want the Pension Keats.” “I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you any matches?” “I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?” “Never.” “Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit.
I haven’t been to Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my friends going.
It is altogether too big for our little lot.
Don’t you think so?
Italy is just about as much as we can manage.
Italy is heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus.
All right, Freddy—I am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
“I was saying, if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience.
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me.
There the contrast is just as much as I can realize.
But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the victoria.” “You’re quite right,” said Cecil.
“Greece is not for our little lot”; and he got in.
Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really.
And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box, which had not been returned.
As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
Cecil’s hard hit.
Lucy won’t marry him.
If you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down.” “But when—” “Late last night.
I must go.” “Perhaps they won’t want me down there.” “No—go on.
Good-bye.” “Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart.
The house was again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata.
He hesitated a moment, but went down the garden as requested.
There he found a mournful company.
It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of assistance.
At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe?
Gracious what a mess everything is!
Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.” Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her.
“You have worried them as much as they can stand.
Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly.
I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.” “Oh, must you?
Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it.” Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about for, either in the house or out of it.” Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.
As they walked up the garden, the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother.
Or will she come with us?” “I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.” “They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has gone, and Freddy won’t play with me.
In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.” “Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur.
“Go and put on your boots.” He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart.
She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do?
Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive.
Would you come too?” “I don’t think I will, thank you.” “No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.” Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!” “Yes.” “I met them on the hill.
Your brother told me.” “Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed.
Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.” “Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have done the right thing.” “So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.” “I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.” “So does mother.
Mother minds dreadfully.” “I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.
It was really a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.” “Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he?
I gathered that he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.” “Boys are so odd.” Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor.
Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel.
Mr. Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action, so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan.
That was really what brought me over.
I thought it might amuse you all.” “How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.
After a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with “Going abroad?
When do they start?” “Next week, I gather.” “Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
Always complaisant, he put the letter away.
But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!
How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad!” “I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast!” She laughed heartily.
“Oh, delightful!
I wish they’d take me.” “Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel?
Perhaps George Emerson is right.
He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’” “Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople.
I have always longed to go to Constantinople.
Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?” Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm.
She had always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed.
He saw, to his surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends, after Cissie Villa.” “Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would give anything to go with them.” “Would your mother spare you again so soon?
You have scarcely been home three months.” “She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement.
“I simply _must_ go away.
I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
“Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away?
I didn’t realize at the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.” “You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—” “Yes, yes.
I knew you’d understand.” Mr. Beebe did not quite understand.
Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family?
Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her.
Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying.
He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down.” “I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all.
Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so masterful.
I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
He would improve me in places where I can’t be improved.
Cecil won’t let a woman decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t.
What nonsense I do talk!
But that is the kind of thing.” “It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you.
I do sympathize and agree most profoundly.
I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?” “But I must go somewhere!” she cried.
“I have been worrying all the morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with clenched fists, and repeated: “I must!
And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
You all think much too highly of me.
I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased.
“I must get away, ever so far.
I must know my own mind and where I want to go.” “Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out of the front-door.
He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource.
She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be.
I know all about it.
The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak.” Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett.
As he had put it to himself at Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
He assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter drop.” “I wonder.” “It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street.
It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at the present moment.” Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows.
Death is a strong word—surely too strong.
There was no question of tragedy.
He said: “Of course, Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she chooses.
Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.” “I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly.
“Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you.
One cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy.
A chance word to a chattering friend, and—” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
A rector lives in a web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he will regard them.
He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately?
I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish.
It is odd how we of that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another’s lives.
Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.
We must really give the Signora a testimonial.” And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern.
On the summit they paused.
The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue.
Summer was retreating.
The wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven.
The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery.
Mr. Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.” They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.
That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably.
Mr. Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces.
They would hand the child her food through the window.
Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past.
I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit.
She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her.
But the future.
Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again.
“I don’t know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.” Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.” To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you.
In it I spy Lucy’s salvation.” “Really.
Now, why?” “She wanted to leave Windy Corner.” “I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to say—selfish.” “It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire a change.” Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect misses.
Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced.
Perhaps she must have a change.
I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand these things.
But why need she go as far as Greece?” “You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner.
“Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?)
Why not Tunbridge Wells?
Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning.
I cannot help her.
I will say no more.
Perhaps I have already said too much.
I am not to talk.
I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.” Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance.
I know too well that I get on Lucy’s nerves.
Our tour was a failure.
She wanted to leave Florence, and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.” “Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe.
“I want your advice.” “Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to him, though familiar to Lucy.
“I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?” Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd woman really did know.
“She must not stop here a moment, and we must keep quiet till she goes.
I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already.
Only, Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone.
If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—” “Otherwise—?” “Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.” Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude.
The tavern sign—a beehive trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him.
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another man” that would have attracted a grosser mind.
He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form.
Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry.
His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.
“They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure.
In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity.
The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement.
Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the action of others.
The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey.
He conversed on indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants; Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could literature influence life?
Windy Corner glimmered.
In the garden, Mrs. Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly.
“This comes of putting off.
We might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece.
I don’t know what the world’s coming to.” “Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must.
Come up to the house and let’s talk it over.
Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?” “Mr.
Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.” “So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good.
Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone.
It was expensive and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed.
Nor would Charlotte have succeeded.
The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right.
It must be something I can’t understand.
Lucy!
Let’s tell her.
Lucy!” “She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said.
He opened the door, and heard the words of a song: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.” “I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.” “Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——” “It’s a song that Cecil gave her.
How odd girls are!” “What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly.
She went into the drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.” Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a bit.” “And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you.” “Oh, splendid!
Oh, thank you!” Mr. Beebe followed.
Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys.
She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness.
Her mother bent over her.
Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_, in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and therefore ignored by the art of to-day.
Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens,” she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.” “Mr.
Beebe knows my rude ways.” “It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he.
“Go on.” “It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly.
“I forget why—harmony or something.” “I suspected it was unscholarly.
It’s so beautiful.” “The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten.
Why throw up the sponge?” “How stupidly you talk!” said his sister.
The _Santa Conversazione_ was broken up.
After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.” “Stop thine ear against the singer—” “Wait a minute; she is finishing.” “From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” “I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear.
She had behaved splendidly, and he had helped her.
He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl’s life.
If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—” Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly.
He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned: “Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX Lying to Mr. Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial England.
They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books, mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.
Miss Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one’s face in the train.
Lucy promised, a little depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.
A gentleman is such a stand-by.” Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine continued.
“It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.
But perhaps he will come out and join you later on.” “Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off.
I do so long to see him.” “No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“She doesn’t like it.” “No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really?
How funny!
I should have thought that in this case—” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going?
It is such a pleasure to have met you!” They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right.
We just got through that time.” But her mother was annoyed.
“I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it.
There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.” Lucy had plenty to say in reply.
She described the Miss Alans’ character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?” “Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then.
It’s much pleasanter.
How wet it is!
Let’s turn in here.” “Here” was the British Museum.
Mrs. Honeychurch refused.
If they must take shelter, let it be in a shop.
Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.
Let’s go to Mudie’s.
I’ll buy a guide-book.” “You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this hole-and-corner work.
You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute.
But why not announce it?
Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?” “It’s only for a few days.” “But why at all?” Lucy was silent.
She was drifting away from her mother.
It was quite easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the incidental advantage of being true.
But she could not say it.
She disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors—Light.
Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent.
She was thinking, “My daughter won’t answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me.
Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.” This was perfectly true.
Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no longer.
It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.
She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk!
Of course I’m not tired of Windy Corner.” “Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?” She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.” “Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?” “Hush, mother!
People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s.
She bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
You see, I come into my money next year.” Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed “eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear.
“I’ve seen the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy.
I have seen so little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like to-day, but to stop.
I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl.” “And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police.
And call it a Mission—when no one wants you!
And call it Duty—when it means that you can’t stand your own home!
And call it Work—when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is!
And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.” “I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys.
But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well.
Take your independence and be gone.
Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.” Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed.
“How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!” “_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.
“More every moment.” “I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike.” “Well, I see the likeness.
The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters.” “What rubbish!
And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you asked her to stop.
I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.” Lucy clenched her teeth.
“My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked Charlotte to stop.
I wish you would keep to the point.” And the conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station.
It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy.
Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful.
“The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked.
For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old mother.
“We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining.
Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was blurred by the soft road.
“_Can’t_ we have the hood down?” she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck.
But now that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?” “It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?” “Yes, miss, they have gone.” Lucy sank back.
The carriage stopped at the Rectory.
She got out to call for Miss Bartlett.
So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary.
Waste!
That word seemed to sum up the whole of life.
Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded her mother.
Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible.
Other people had.
When the maid opened the door, she was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a great favour: might she go to church?
Mr. Beebe and his mother had already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily.
“I forgot it was Friday.
Let’s all go.
Powell can go round to the stables.” “Lucy dearest—” “No church for me, thank you.” A sigh, and they departed.
The church was invisible, but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour.
This was a stained window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation.
Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?
There was only that one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait, sir.” Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips.
George she had faced, and could have faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry!
George is so sorry!
He thought he had a right to try.
I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first.
He ought not to have tried.
I knew nothing about it at all.” If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand.
“But you must not scold him.” Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love.
I said: ‘When love comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind.
No.
Passion is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my day is over, and though there is the result.
Poor boy!
He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that whatever you felt you did not mean.
Yet”—his voice gathered strength: he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?” Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries.
Holding it up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son.” “But you do remember it?” “He has misbehaved himself from the first.” “I only was told that he loved you last Sunday.
I never could judge behaviour.
I—I—suppose he has.” Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to him.
His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said.
“I am glad he is sorry.
Do you know what he did?” “Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction.
“He only tried when he should not have tried.
You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are going to marry the man you love.
Do not go out of George’s life saying he is abominable.” “No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong.
I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all.
My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late—” “Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?” “Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.” “As his mother did.” “But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr.
Emerson_—what are you talking about?” “When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round.
She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered.
“Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in again!
A judgement!
And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church!
Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch?
Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever?” “I don’t know,” gasped Lucy.
“I don’t understand this sort of thing.
I was not meant to understand it.” “But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his principles.
I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was well she was ill.
He made her think about sin, and she went under thinking about it.” It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man.
“I did hold firm.” And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what cost!—he had won a victory over them.
“My boy shall go back to the earth untouched.” She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill. “Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present.
“George last Sunday—no, not ill: just gone under.
He is never ill.
But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
It was always touch and go.
He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live.
He will never think anything worth while.
You remember that church at Florence?” Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible.
Then we took the house here, and he goes bathing with your brother, and became better.
You saw him bathing?” “I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair.
I am deeply sorry about it.” “Then there came something about a novel.
I didn’t follow it at all; I had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old.
Ah, well, one must have failures.
George comes down to-morrow, and takes me up to his London rooms.
He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be where he is.” “Mr.
Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my account.
I am going to Greece.
Don’t leave your comfortable house.” It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled.
“How good everyone is!
And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning and heard I was going!
Here I am so comfortable with a fire.” “Yes, but you won’t go back to London.
It’s absurd.” “I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he can’t.
He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t.
I’ve been bother enough to the world by now.
I can’t have you moving out of your house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my account.
You must stop!
I am just going to Greece.” “All the way to Greece?” Her manner altered.
“To Greece?” “So you must stop.
You won’t talk about this business, I know.
I can trust you both.” “Certainly you can.
We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the life that you have chosen.” “I shouldn’t want—” “I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George?
No, it was wrong of George to try.
We have pushed our beliefs too far.
I fancy that we deserve sorrow.” She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling.
To Lucy who could not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still.
I think I will sit in the carriage.” “Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.” “Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you.
And what were you saying about going abroad?” She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands.
Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you.
I hope—it isn’t because George spoke that you are both going?” “No.” “I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.” “Thank you.” At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church.
His cassock was covered with rain.
“That’s all right,” he said kindly.
“I counted on you two keeping each other company.
It’s pouring again.
The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it.
Did Powell go round?” “I think so; I’ll see.” “No—of course, I’ll see.
How are the Miss Alans?” “Very well, thank you.” “Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?” “I—I did.” “Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the two Miss Alans?
Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm.
I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely.
“I made a slip.
Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England.” Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man.
To George, to Cecil, she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece.
And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving him?
You are leaving the man you love?” “I—I had to.” “Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?” Terror came over her, and she lied again.
She made the long, convincing speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more.
He heard her in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.
It seems to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.” She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world.
It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so dreadful.
It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the things that I might have avoided.
We can help one another but little.
I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle.
Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren’t?
Do you remember before, when you refused the room with the view?
Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent.
“Don’t trust me, Miss Honeychurch.
Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was still silent.
“‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’ I think he puts it well.
Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean.
You love George!” And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
“You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
You won’t marry the other man for his sake.” “How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man.” “But you are.” She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.
It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way.
You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat.
I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and _for which_ you marry.
I know that, with George, you will find them, and that you love him.
Then be his wife.
He is already part of you.
Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part.
You will wish that it was.
You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.
I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the body.
Ah!
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that!
Ah!
for a little directness to liberate the soul!
Your soul, dear Lucy!
I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round.
But we have souls.
I cannot say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining yours.
I cannot bear it.
It is again the darkness creeping in; it is hell.” Then he checked himself.
“What nonsense I have talked—how abstract and remote!
And I have made you cry!
Dear girl, forgive my prosiness; marry my boy.
When I think what life is, and how seldom love is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made.” She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.
Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
“Cecil—Mr.
Beebe—the ticket’s bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair.
“I’m caught in the tangle.
I must suffer and grow old away from him.
I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
They trusted me.” A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only.
Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—” “No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—” “But why should they, when you have deceived them?” Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.” “You’re not worthy of their trust.” “What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?” “One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson.
To whom do you refer?
Trust whom?” “I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George.
They have loved one another all along.” Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman.
A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?” “Mr.
Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—” “Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!” “It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly.
“It’s the part of people that you don’t understand.” Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy!
Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr.
Beebe, could you help me?” He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am more grieved than I can possibly express.
It is lamentable, lamentable—incredible.” “What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me.
Marry George, Miss Honeychurch.
He will do admirably.” He walked out and left them.
They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair.
But his face revived her.
It was the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark.
Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know.
But remember the mountains over Florence and the view.
Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise.
George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him.
Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.” “You kiss me,” said the girl.
“You kiss me.
I will try.” He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his salutation remained.
He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he managed to strengthen her.
It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once.” Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves.
They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf.
They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity.
Trembling, anxious, cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go round the world.
The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had your father’s room.
I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.” He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.” “Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window.
It was evening and again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully.
“What can such people be made of?” “Same stuff as parsons are made of.” “Nonsense!” “Quite right.
It is nonsense.” “Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.” “Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and advancing his face to hers.
“What’s there to cry at?
Kiss me here.” He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all.
When it came to the point, it was she who remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who knew whose room this had been last year.
It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.” “Now kiss me here; then here.” Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window, opened it (as the English will), and leant out.
There was the parapet, there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills.
The cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago.
A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool.
He had helped himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its name is, still shows.” “San Miniato.
I’ll just finish your sock.” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils, the Miss Bartletts!
Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?” “Not yet.” His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?” “Silly boy!
He thinks he’s being dignified.
He knew we should go off in the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands.
They had fair warning, and now he calls it an elopement.
Ridiculous boy—” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” “But it will all come right in the end.
He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women.
He has, for the second time, quite altered.
Why will men have theories about women?
I haven’t any about men.
I wish, too, that Mr. Beebe—” “You may well wish that.” “He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us again.
I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner.
I wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run.” “Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only thing I did do—and you came back to me.
So possibly you know.” He turned back into the room.
“Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to the window, so that she, too, saw all the view.
They sank upon their knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one another’s names.
Ah!
it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—” “Oh, bother that man!” But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte.
How cruel she would be to a man like that!” “Look at the lights going over the bridge.” “But this room reminds me of Charlotte.
How horrible to grow old in Charlotte’s way!
To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house.
For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
You couldn’t have made me.
When I am very happy”—she kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs.
If Charlotte had only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to silly Greece, and become different for ever.” “But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely.
He said so.” “Oh, no, she didn’t see him.
She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church.
She said so.” George was obstinate again.
“My father,” said he, “saw her, and I prefer his word.
He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett.
A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up.
He didn’t speak to her.” Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other’s arms.
It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting.
George, who disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew.
Then, why did she risk the meeting?
She knew he was there, and yet she went to church.” They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind.
She rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?” “Mean what?” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.” “Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.” “Niente.” The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?” He whispered: “Is it this?
Is this possible?
I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped.
That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down.
That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped.
I can’t explain her any other way.
Can you?
Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable.
The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend.
There are details—it burnt.
I read the book afterwards.
She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through.
She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
We can never make friends with her or thank her.
But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.” “It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.” Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited, love attained.
But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean.
[Illustration] A Room With A View By E. M. Forster CONTENTS PART ONE Chapter I The Bertolini “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at all.
She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart.
Oh, Lucy!” “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the Signora’s unexpected accent.
“It might be London.” She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A.
Oxon.
), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London?
I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside.
I suppose it is one’s being so tired.” “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno.
The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.
The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!” “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that you shouldn’t have a view.” Lucy felt that she had been selfish.
“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of course, you must look over the Arno, too.
I meant that.
The first vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no.
You must have it.” “I insist on it.
Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.” “She would never forgive _me_.” The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a little peevish.
They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument.
He said: “I have a view, I have a view.” Miss Bartlett was startled.
Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.
She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she glanced at him.
He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes.
There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes.
These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim.
So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A view?
Oh, a view!
How delightful a view is!” “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George.
He has a view too.” “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have yours.
We’ll change.” The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.
Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.” “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.” “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy.
Her cousin again repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted.
“Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son.
“There’s nothing else to say.” He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful.
Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before.
Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change?
What possible objection had she?
They would clear out in half an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality.
It was impossible to snub any one so gross.
Her face reddened with displeasure.
She looked around as much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are genteel.” “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear.
This pension is a failure.
To-morrow we will make a change.” Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness.
Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh!
Why, it’s Mr. Beebe!
Oh, how perfectly lovely!
Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are.
Oh!” Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint: “How do you do, Mr. Beebe?
I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.” The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.
But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
“Just fancy how small the world is.
Summer Street, too, makes it so specially funny.” “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—” “Yes, I heard from mother so last week.
She didn’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr.
Beebe is—’” “Quite right,” said the clergyman.
“I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June.
I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.” “Oh, how glad I am!
The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.” “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.” “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.” He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons.
He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before.
It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field.
“Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded.
“The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.” “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table.
“Mr.
Beebe, you are wrong.
The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.” “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin.
“We are in luck.” And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them.
People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would grow upon them.
The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do.
Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them.
And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato!
They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words.
I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.” The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did.
It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more than cloth.
Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her daughter.
It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.
Was this really Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.
She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle.
“We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.
“The first evening means so much.
When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.” He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?” “Emerson.” “Is he a friend of yours?” “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.” “Then I will say no more.” He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing.
His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.” “You acted very naturally,” said he.
He seemed thoughtful, and after a few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of accepting.” “No _harm_, of course.
But we could not be under an obligation.” “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show gratitude.
He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he means.
He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them.
He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite.
It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.” Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice.” “I think he is; nice and tiresome.
I differ from him on almost every point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores.
When he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up.
He has no tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will not keep his opinions to himself.
We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.” “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?” Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?” “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet.
He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains.
Of course, he has all his father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.” “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett.
“So you think I ought to have accepted their offer?
You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?” “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.” “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?” He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared.
“Why didn’t you talk, Lucy?
He prefers young people, I’m sure.
I do hope I haven’t monopolized him.
I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time.” “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a clergyman.” “My dear Lucia—” “Well, you know what I mean.
And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.” “Funny girl!
How you do remind me of your mother.
I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe.” “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.” “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world.
I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.” “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine.
She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered.
Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.” And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more careful.
It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.” Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat.
Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room.
It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England.
Signora Bertolini is so English.” “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy.
“We dread going to bed.” “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed.
“If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful!
We were so sorry for you at dinner.” “I think he was meaning to be kind.” “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr.
Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature.
Of course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.” “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
No one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know.
No, he is not tactful; yet, have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?” “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.
“Are not beauty and delicacy the same?” “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly.
“But things are so difficult, I sometimes think.” She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms.
I’m so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again.
He has let me come and ask you.
He would be so pleased.” “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious.
I must apologize for my interference.” Gravely displeased, he turned to go.
Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours.
It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only here through your kindness.
If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it.
Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?” She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this.
I do not wish the acceptance to come from you.
Grant me that, at all events.” Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously: “Mr.
Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.” The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally.
But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out.” Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath.
All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first.
Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms!
It is all he can do to keep polite.” “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe.
Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.
“Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part.
Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature.
Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow.
Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said: “I think one might venture now.
No, Lucy, do not stir.
I will superintend the move.” “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear.
It is my affair.” “But I would like to help you.” “No, dear.” Charlotte’s energy!
And her unselfishness!
She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
So Lucy felt, or strove to feel.
And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful.
At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room.
Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.” Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him.
I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.” “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.
It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances.
It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation.
Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle.
Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson.
So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him.
Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.
It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
An electric tram came rushing underneath the window.
No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand.
Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go.
Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.
Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.
The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway.
Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.
So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone.
By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.
Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out?
Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone.
Miss Bartlett could not allow this.
Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin.
Oh, no!
that would never do.
Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person.
Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe.
Italians understand.
A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.
Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.” Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad.
The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.” Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut!
Miss Lucy!
I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He does but touch the surface of things.
As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it.
The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.” This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.
Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno.
How delightfully warm!
But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?
Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante.
San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story.
The men on the river were fishing.
(Untrue; but then, so is most information.)
Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried: “A smell!
a true Florentine smell!
Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.” “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
Buon giorno!
Buon giorno!” bowing right and left.
“Look at that adorable wine-cart!
How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!” So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.
It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno!
Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors.
_That_ is the true democracy.
Though I am a real Radical as well.
There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy.
“We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.” “I see, I see.
And now you have gone over to the enemy.” “Oh, please—!
If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right.
And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.” “Shameful!
A manufacturing district, I suppose?” “No—in the Surrey hills.
About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.” Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well.
It is full of the very nicest people.
Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?” “Very well indeed.” “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?” “Why, she rents a field of us!
How funny!” Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?” “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob.
“Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.” Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
Italy receded.
They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her.
And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed: “Bless us!
Bless us and save us!
We’ve lost the way.” Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window.
But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost!
lost!
My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.
How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do?
Two lone females in an unknown town.
Now, this is what _I_ call an adventure.” Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven!
And no, you are not, not, _not_ to look at your Baedeker.
Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it.
We will simply drift.” Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became discontented herself.
For one ravishing moment Italy appeared.
She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale.
There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven.
Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop, because it looked so typical.
It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown.
But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness.
Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically.
It was Santa Croce.
The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them.
I do detest conventional intercourse.
Nasty!
they are going into the church, too.
Oh, the Britisher abroad!” “We sat opposite them at dinner last night.
They have given us their rooms.
They were so very kind.” “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish.
“They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.
It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.” “What would you ask us?” Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she, at all events, would get full marks.
In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried: “There goes my local-colour box!
I must have a word with him!” And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes.
Then she began to get tired.
The beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places.
She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original.
But at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both gesticulating largely.
Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her Baedeker.
How could she find her way home?
How could she find her way about in Santa Croce?
Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in Florence again.
A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans.
Of course, it must be a wonderful building.
But how like a barn!
And how very cold!
Of course, it contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper.
But who was to tell her which they were?
She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
There was no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she began to be happy.
She puzzled out the Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.
She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed.
Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated.
What could this mean?
They did it again and again.
Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue.
Punishment followed quickly.
The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward.
She was too late.
He fell heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted forward also.
“Hard in life, hard in death.
Go out into the sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
Intolerable bishop!” The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and frightened!
But what else can you expect from a church?” The child’s legs had become as melting wax.
Each time that old Mr. Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar.
Fortunately an Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue.
By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
He stood.
Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson.
“You have done more than all the relics in the world.
I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy.
There is no scheme of the universe—” He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons.
She was determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply.
“But what are you doing here?
Are you doing the church?
Are you through with the church?” “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance.
“I came here with Miss Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.” “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.” “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
“I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded.
It’s worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker.
_That’s_ worth minding.” Lucy was puzzled.
She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where the idea would lead?
She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you.
I really came to help with the child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.” “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say.
You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious.
But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it.
Lucy could not get cross.
Mr. Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him.
On the other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him.
It was at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope.
It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will kindly tell me which they are.” The son nodded.
With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel.
There was a hint of the teacher about him.
She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared.
Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective.
Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true?
How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!” “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort!
Built by faith indeed!
That simply means the workmen weren’t paid properly.
And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
Look at that fat man in blue!
He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.” He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might.
The audience shifted uneasily, and so did Lucy.
She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her.
They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it?
Yes or no?” George replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all.
I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.” “You will never go up,” said his father.
“You and I, dear boy, will lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives.” “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is, going up.
It did happen like that, if it happened at all.” “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice.
“The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.” The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands.
They filed out of the chapel in silence.
Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“There’s plenty of room for us all.
Stop!” The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.” George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is.
I don’t remember.” “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
It’s that Mr.
Eager.
Why did he go?
Did we talk too loud?
How vexatious.
I shall go and say we are sorry.
Hadn’t I better?
Then perhaps he will come back.” “He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
Cuthbert Eager.
Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent.
The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her.
“He will try to be kind.” “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters.
But he is kind to people because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.” “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully—” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain.
Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness.
She saw him once again at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns.
Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only find solution in the night.
The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people.
They won’t come back.” “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy.
“Have you looked at those saints?” “Yes,” said Lucy.
“They are lovely.
Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin?” He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.
There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists.
But Mr. Emerson was only half interested.
He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily.
“I saw nothing in it.” “I like Giotto,” she replied.
“It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values.
Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
A baby is worth a dozen saints.
And my baby’s worth the whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.” Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated.
“He’s unhappy.” “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?
What more is one to give him?
And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God.
With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.” She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one.
She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked.
“He comes out for his holiday to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone.
Eh?
What did you say?” Lucy had made no suggestion.
Suddenly he said: “Now don’t be stupid over this.
I don’t require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me.
He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose?
But let yourself go.
You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night.
Let yourself go.
Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself.
It will be good for both of you.” To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.” “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.” “What things?” “The things of the universe.
It is quite true.
They don’t.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?” In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: “‘From far, from eve and morning, The stuff of life to knit me George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?
We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
But why should this make us unhappy?
Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice.
I don’t believe in this world sorrow.” Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us.
Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.” Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.
A young man melancholy because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried.
“You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then she became matronly.
“Oh, but your son wants employment.
Has he no particular hobby?
Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother.
Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.” The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it.
Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.
Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.
The dear George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd.
He approached, his face in the shadow.
He said: “Miss Bartlett.” “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective.
“Where?
Where?” “In the nave.” “I see.
Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson.
“Poor girl!” She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
“Poor girl?
I fail to understand the point of that remark.
I think myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you.
I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid time.
Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it.
Good-bye.
Thank you both so much for all your kindness.
Ah, yes!
there does come my cousin.
A delightful morning!
Santa Croce is a wonderful church.” She joined her cousin.
Chapter III Music, Violets, and the Letter “S” It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano.
She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected.
The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom.
Lucy had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.
Nor was she the passionate young lady, who performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the pictorial style.
And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory.
Victory of what and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano.
A few people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep.
She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarette-case.
Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it.
It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower.
The seats were filled with a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork.
Among the promised items was “Miss Honeychurch.
Piano.
Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III.
He was in suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends.
With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory.
He was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen.
The audience clapped, no less respectful.
It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners.
I do not consider her choice of a piece happy.
Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs.” “Introduce me.” “She will be delighted.
She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon.” “My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe.
“Why ever did she listen to it?” When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch, disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face.
She loved going to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and meringues.
He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also.
But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him: “If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting both for us and for her.” Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing!
Some one said just the same to mother, and she said she trusted I should never live a duet.” “Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?” “She doesn’t mind it.
But she doesn’t like one to get excited over anything; she thinks I am silly about it.
She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any one’s.
She has never got over it.
Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant—” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality.
She could not complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet.
The whole life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey, and the hills were dirty purple.
Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold, tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and a tickling cough in her throat.
On another day, when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray.
She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe.” “Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy.
This was a stock remark, the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition.
Miss Lavish was so original.
Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness.
For that, and for other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is writing a book?” “They do say so.” “What is it about?” “It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know.” “I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.
We started such friends.
But I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce.
Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.” “The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.” He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish.
They were always in each other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third.
Miss Lavish he believed he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning.
Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells?
All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work.
Girls like Lucy were charming to look at, but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped.
The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore.
But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse.
She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill!
And Mr. Beebe here besides.
Who would suppose this is Italy?
There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.” She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in my room with the door shut.
Doors shut; indeed, most necessary.
No one has the least idea of privacy in this country.
And one person catches it from another.” Lucy answered suitably.
Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.
The Italians are a most unpleasant people.
They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves.
We are at their mercy.
They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires.
From the cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial!
They have no conception of the intellectual life.
How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer over the children’s edjucaishion.
_Hi_ won’t ’ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’” Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way.
Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers.
Indeed, who would have supposed that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last the cause was disclosed.
From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “E.
L.” “That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman.
“A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she’d start a pipe.” “Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.
She took to it, practically in despair, after her life’s work was carried away in a landslip.
Surely that makes it more excusable.” “What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say they nearly always do.
Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink.
She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written.
The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she had an idea.
First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came here—this must on no account get round.
And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.” Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring.
She felt she had made almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.” Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade.
That old Mr. Emerson, who puts things very strangely—” Her jaw dropped.
She was silent.
Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper: “Stomach.
He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind.
I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden.
As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter.
But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought.
She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce.
Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson.
Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ Just imagine!
‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak.
I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking.
I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman!
I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place.
But that was not all.
After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.” “Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I shall go alone.’ She went.
At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.” “Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows.
No one will ever know.
Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.” “Mr.
Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice?
I do so want to know.” Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.
“No; but it is so difficult.
Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him.
Miss Alan, what do you think?
Is he nice?” The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.
Mr. Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying: “I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.” “Violets?
Oh, dear!
Who told you about the violets?
How do things get round?
A pension is a bad place for gossips.
No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce.
Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch!
It really was too bad.
No, I have quite changed.
I do _not_ like the Emersons.
They are _not_ nice.” Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly.
He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed.
He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them.
Miss Lavish, who represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans, who stood for good breeding, were following her.
Miss Bartlett, smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil.
The case of Lucy was different.
She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail.
After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now.
Even their seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once.
Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite politely, of course.” “Most right of her.
They don’t understand our ways.
They must find their level.” Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under.
They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son.
He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them.
It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle.
There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief.
“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said Lucy.
“I want to go round the town in the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say: “I wish we could.
Unluckily I have letters.
If you do want to go out alone, won’t you be better on your feet?” “Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!” But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her from the window, “and she knows it.
I put it down to too much Beethoven.” Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr. Beebe was right.
Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music.
She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan.
Conversation was tedious; she wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram.
This she might not attempt.
It was unladylike.
Why?
Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why.
It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different.
Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much.
But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.
The dragons have gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst.
She reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early Victorian song.
It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas!
the creature grows degenerate.
In her heart also there are springing up strange desires.
She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.
Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are alive.
Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
Nor has she any system of revolt.
Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she had done so.
This afternoon she was peculiarly restive.
She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved.
As she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus, being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it.
(A pity in art of course signified the nude.)
Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it.
She felt a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s “Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni Madonnas.
For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.
She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her to be conscious of it.
“The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to her.
The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it.
Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind.
It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.
An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him, and rest content.
Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.
It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky.
Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.
“Cinque lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest.
He frowned; he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all.
A crowd rose out of the dusk.
It hid this extraordinary man from her, and bore him away to the fountain.
Mr. George Emerson happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where the man had been.
How very odd!
Across something.
Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?” “Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything.
She had complained of dullness, and lo!
one man was stabbed, and another held her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade.
He must have carried her.
He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees.
She repeated: “Oh, what have I done?” “You fainted.” “I—I am very sorry.” “How are you now?” “Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home.
There’s no point in our stopping.” He held out his hand to pull her up.
She pretended not to see it.
The cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily.
The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been!
I might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well.
I can go alone, thank you.” His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?” “I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.
I must have dropped them out there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously.
“Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?” He added to his kindness.
As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!” She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.” “Yes, I am, thank you so very much.” “No, you aren’t.
You’d go openly if you were.” “But I had rather—” “Then I don’t fetch your photographs.” “I had rather be alone.” He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him.
“And don’t move till I come back.” In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in dreams.
The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day, and joined itself to earth.
How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square?
Again the thought occurred to her, “Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man, had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder.
Oddly enough, it was an easy topic.
She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before.
Being strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood.
She rose without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her, she walked firmly enough towards the Arno.
There a cabman signalled to them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police!
Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish.
When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?” He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?” “Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr.
Emerson!” “Well?” “Where are the photographs?” He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.” “I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.
Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood.
There!
I’m glad I’ve told you; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them.” He pointed down-stream.
“They’ve gone.” The river swirled under the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man.
“For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled.
It isn’t exactly that a man has died.” Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.” “Mr.
Emerson—” He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.” They were close to their pension.
She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment.
He did likewise.
There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship.
She moved her elbows before saying: “I have behaved ridiculously.” He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what came over me.” “I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.” “Oh, all right.” “And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?” “I’m afraid I don’t.” “I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?” “Your behaviour?
Oh, yes, all right—all right.” “Thank you so much.
And would you—” She could not carry her request any further.
The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
He had thrown her photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason.
It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man.
He would do her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might even have a high opinion of her.
But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe.
It was useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.
She had been in his arms, and he remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari’s shop.
It was not exactly that a man had died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents do happen, and then one returns to the old life!” “I don’t.” Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.” “But why, Mr. Emerson?
What do you mean?” “I shall want to live, I say.” Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno, whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson.
She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also.
They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.
It might have been most unpleasant.
Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone.
None of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the embankment.
Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure, not that she had encountered it.
This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action.
There were two plans between which she had to choose.
Mr. Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies.
Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?
Charlotte declined for herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.
But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth.
“It’s very kind of Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you.
I had much rather.” “Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.
How abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always!
But now she should alter.
All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the Lung’ Arno.
The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and colour.
Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it.
She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this, too!” Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did.
“Look, Lucia!
Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party.
I feared you would repent you of your choice.” Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.
Yesterday had been a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo.
Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not to re-enter it.
She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately remained.
Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria.
She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance.
For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.
She hailed them briskly.
The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett.
“After your despair of yesterday!
What a fortunate thing!” “Aha!
Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck.
Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?” “I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.” The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless creatures.
I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn’t pry.” She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few calculations in realism.
Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material.
A good deal of it was unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt.
The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note.
For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.” That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?” Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot.
But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish concluded.
“It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline.
There will be a deal of local colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall also introduce some humorous characters.
And let me give you all fair warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.” “Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett.
“I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons.” Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can.
For I repeat and I insist, and I have always held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life.” There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded.
Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett.
“That last remark struck me as so particularly true.
It should be a most pathetic novel.” Lucy assented.
At present her great aim was not to get put into it.
Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,” continued Miss Bartlett slowly.
“None but the superficial would be shocked at her.
We had a long talk yesterday.
She believes in justice and truth and human interest.
She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr.
Eager!
Why, how nice!
What a pleasant surprise!” “Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.” “We were chatting to Miss Lavish.” His brow contracted.
“So I saw.
Were you indeed?
Andate via!
sono occupato!” The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile.
“I am about to venture a suggestion.
Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a drive in the hills?
We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour’s ramble on the hillside.
The view thence of Florence is most beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape.
Decidedly.
But who looks at it to-day?
Ah, the world is too much for us.” Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that Mr.
Eager was no commonplace chaplain.
He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home.
He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent.
Tea at a Renaissance villa?
Nothing had been said about it yet.
But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same.
But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew.
A drive in the hills with Mr.
Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no longer the greatest of them.
She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain.
“In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity.
Andate via!
andate presto, presto!
Ah, the town!
Beautiful as it is, it is the town.” They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies.
To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and humiliating.” “Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened.
She can hardly bear to speak of it.” She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question.
“Do not blame her, please, Mr.
Eager.
The fault is mine: I left her unchaperoned.” “So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable.
His dark, handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.” “One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience.
I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?” Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—” “Were over at the Loggia.” “That must have saved you much.
You have not, of course, seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.” Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal league of Italy with youth.
He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr.
Eager, binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico’s angels.
She tore.
A shrill cry rose from the vendor.
The book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr.
Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a grievance.
His mysterious persecution of Mr.
Eager became relentless; the air rang with his threats and lamentations.
He appealed to Lucy; would not she intercede?
He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on bread.
He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued.
Under the chaplain’s guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy.
She had been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr.
Eager, she knew not why.
And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased to respect them.
She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist.
She doubted that Mr.
Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose.
They were tried by some new test, and they were found wanting.
As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte she was exactly the same.
It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact.
A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press.
I came across him at Brixton.” They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr.
Eager, “one has only sympathy for their success.
The desire for education and for social advance—in these things there is something not wholly vile.
There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as they would make of it.” “Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.” He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.” “Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead.
I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with me.
He was in my London parish long ago.
The other day in Santa Croce, when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him.
Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub.” “What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr.
Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended.
Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity.
Lucy, though she wished never to see the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man?
We know that already.” “Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all.
The boy—an innocent child at the time—I will exclude.
God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him.” “Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not hear.” “To speak plainly,” said Mr.
Eager, “it is.
I will say no more.” For the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the first time in her life.
“You have said very little.” “It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.
He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips.
It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily.
“That man murdered his wife!” “How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.
That day in Santa Croce—did they say anything against me?” “Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.” “Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you.
But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
“They’re nothing to me.” “How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene.
The shopman was possibly listening.
“She will find it difficult.
For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God.” The addition of God was striking.
But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
A silence followed which might have been impressive, but was merely awkward.
Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive.
“Drive?
Oh, is our drive to come off?” Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr.
Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed.
“It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all.
Why should he invite us in that absurd manner?
We might as well invite him.
We are each paying for ourselves.” Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish.” “How?” “Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.” “That will mean another carriage.” “Far worse.
Mr.
Eager does not like Eleanor.
She knows it herself.
The truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.” They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank.
Lucy stood by the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer, or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain.
The well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets?
Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it.
Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck.
She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank.
As she groped she murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr.
Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we must be prepared.
It is you they really want; I am only asked for appearances.
You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will follow behind.
A one-horse carriage would do for us.
Yet how difficult it is!” “It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.” “Oh, dear, Lucy!
I do hope Florence isn’t boring you.
Speak the word, and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.” “Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her mother’s letters could be.
She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway.
She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs.
Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news that interested her least.
“Do you know the Vyses?” “Oh, not that way back.
We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria.” “They’re nice people, the Vyses.
So clever—my idea of what’s really clever.
Don’t you long to be in Rome?” “I die for it!” The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant.
It has no grass, no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick.
By an odd chance—unless we believe in a presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity.
Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before.
Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly.
“Here’s an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel?
For I do know what I want.
I’m sick of Florence.
No, you said you’d go to the ends of the earth!
Do!
Do!” Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied: “Oh, you droll person!
Pray, what would become of your drive in the hills?” They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up the stony hill.
Mr. Beebe recognized him at once.
Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.
And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light.
To her Mr.
Eager objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition.
But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
She did not mind.
Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy.
The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss Lavish.
For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting Mr.
Eager, had doubled the size of the party.
And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus transformed.
Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.
But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr.
Eager, repressive towards Miss Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring.
She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate.
But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully.
In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy.
She had refused, not because she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he did know.
And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia, but by the river.
To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled emotion, but of the whole fabric.
There was really something blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word.
This sense of wickedness had been slight at first.
She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo.
But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again.
And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr.
Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling?
As a student of art?” “Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!” “Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like myself?” “Oh, no.
I am here as a tourist.” “Oh, indeed,” said Mr.
Eager.
“Are you indeed?
If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.
The result is, they mix up towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl.
You know the American girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’ There’s travelling for you.
Ha!
ha!
ha!” “I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit.
“The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.” “Quite so.
Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are here for trade, for example.
But the greater part are students.
Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico.
I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left.
No, you can only see it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall.
She is very proud of that thick hedge.
Inside, perfect seclusion.
One might have gone back six hundred years.
Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?” “It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish.
“Tell me, where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day?” But Mr.
Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr.
Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill.
“Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’?
He is working at Gemistus Pletho.
Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.” During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully.
Lucy had a spasm of envy.
Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.
They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road.
“Piano!
piano!” said Mr.
Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped his horses up again.
Now Mr.
Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or was he one of its manifestations?
The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.
“Piano!
piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.
Phaethon, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was most unpleasant.
The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr.
Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but at its manner.
At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and patted them on the back to signify his approval.
And Miss Lavish, though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried.
“But I dare say I shall receive scant support.
I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life.
This is what _I_ call an adventure.” “We must not submit,” said Mr.
Eager.
“I knew he was trying it on.
He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.” “Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood in no awe.
“Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there?
To be driven by lovers—A king might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I know.” Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect.
Mr.
Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will, was determined to make himself heard.
He addressed the driver again.
Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream, with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker, and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased.
Why should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto.
She pointed at the other carriage.
Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other.
Then Persephone got down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr.
Eager, smiting his hands together as the carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson.
“It is defeat.
You have parted two people who were happy.” Mr.
Eager shut his eyes.
He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but he would not speak to him.
The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took up the matter warmly.
He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money.
He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.
We have no rights over his soul.” Miss Lavish frowned.
It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said.
“He jolted us.” “That I deny.
It was as restful as sleeping.
Aha!
he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder?
He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is justified.
And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl, too.
It doesn’t do to injure young people.
Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici?” Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have.
Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature?” “The Lord knows.
Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go fighting against the Spring.’” Mr.
Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured.
“‘War not with the May’ would render a correct meaning.” “The point is, we have warred with it.
Look.” He pointed to the Val d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them.
Do you suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man?
But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.” No one encouraged him to talk.
Presently Mr.
Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain.
It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before.
He had ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending.
Standing there, he had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work.
But where exactly had he stood?
That was the question which Mr.
Eager hoped to solve now.
And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups.
Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask.
In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio Baldovinetti, but the drive.
Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was very sorry that she had asked him.
She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him.
Mr. Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish.
“Oh, but I shall die!
Of course it was the railway!” She could not control her mirth.
“He is the image of a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.” “Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion.
“Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—” “I can’t stop.
Let me go my wicked way.
A porter—” “Eleanor!” “I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy.
“The Emersons won’t hear, and they wouldn’t mind if they did.” Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly.
“Pouf!
Wouf!
You naughty girl!
Go away!” “Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr.
Eager, I’m sure.” “I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.” “Mr.
Eager will be offended.
It is your party.” “Please, I’d rather stop here with you.” “No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish.
“It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.
Miss Lucy, you are to go.
We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.” The girl was stubborn.
As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.
Such a one was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte.
She wished she had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Oh, I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here.” Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm.
Lucy did not look at the view either.
She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish.
“Observe my foresight.” With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy.
The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
If I do feel it coming on I shall stand.
Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist.
“Here we are, all settled delightfully.
Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown.
Sit down, dear; you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared her throat.
“Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold.
It’s the tiniest cough, and I have had it three days.
It’s nothing to do with sitting here at all.” There was only one way of treating the situation.
At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr.
Eager, vanquished by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.
The miscreant, a bony young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up.
Of course he knew where.
Not so far either.
His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon.
He should just think he did know where.
He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary.
What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good?
Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings!
He showed her his cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?” She was correct as usual.
He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her.
Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.
Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
She thanked him with real pleasure.
In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
For the first time she felt the influence of Spring.
His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?” “Ma buoni uomini.” He bowed.
Certainly.
Good men first, violets afterwards.
They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker.
They were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces.
He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant boughs.
She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.
Not a step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?” There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.
The voice of Mr.
Eager?
He shrugged his shoulders.
An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge.
She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen.
The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
Light and beauty enveloped her.
She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.” She did not answer.
From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view, and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam.
But never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival.
For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.
He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves.
The bushes above them closed.
He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called, “Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.
What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was slow to discover.
Mr.
Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk.
Mr. Emerson, seeking his son, was told whereabouts to find him.
Mr. Beebe, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the return home.
There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment.
Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics.
Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise.
Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett.
Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager.
Mr. Emerson had lost George.
Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square.
Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable.
He climbed on to the box shivering, with his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather.
“Let us go immediately,” he told them.
“The signorino will walk.” “All the way?
He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently.
I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.
He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence.
He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.
He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also.
Not so these English.
They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents, but infinitely the least dangerous.
Once back in the town, he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more.
Of course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it.
But after all, what have we to do with taverns?
Real menace belongs to the drawing-room.
It was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun.
Lucy sat beside her; Mr.
Eager sat opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious.
They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together.
The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol.
There was a lightning flash, and Miss Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front.
At the next flash, Lucy screamed also.
Mr.
Eager addressed her professionally: “Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith.
If I might say so, there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements.
Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?” “No—of course—” “Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous.
The steel knives, the only articles which might attract the current, are in the other carriage.
And, in any case, we are infinitely safer than if we were walking.
Courage—courage and faith.” Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand.
At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles, gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr.
Eager!” called Mr. Beebe.
“We want your assistance.
Will you interpret for us?” “George!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way.
He may be killed.” “Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver is no help.
Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.” “He may be killed!” cried the old man.
“He may be killed!” “Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage.
“In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.” “What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr.
Eager know?” “Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing.
But—” she pointed at the driver—“_he_ knows everything.
Dearest, had we better?
Shall I?” She took out her purse.
“It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book, she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it.
As well this ending to his day as any.
But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road.
The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen.
If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt.
They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.
They descended from the carriages; they embraced each other.
It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them.
For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly.
In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike.
Miss Lavish calculated that, even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the accident.
Mr.
Eager mumbled a temperate prayer.
But the drivers, through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me.
Kiss me again.
Only you can understand me.
You warned me to be careful.
And I—I thought I was developing.” “Do not cry, dearest.
Take your time.” “I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse.
Once by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?” The thought disturbed her repentance.
As a matter of fact, the storm was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not.
One would always pray against that.” “He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that.
I simply slipped into those violets.
No, I want to be really truthful.
I am a little to blame.
I had silly thoughts.
The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.” “In a book?” “Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.” “And then?” “But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
Indeed, she had little more to learn.
With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her.
All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
“It is so hard to be absolutely truthful.” “Don’t be troubled, dearest.
Wait till you are calmer.
We will talk it over before bed-time in my room.” So they re-entered the city with hands clasped.
It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others.
The storm had ceased, and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son.
Mr. Beebe had regained good humour, and Mr.
Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish.
Charlotte alone she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening.
She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it.
All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be carefully laid before her cousin.
And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself.
I shan’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know what.” Miss Alan asked her to play.
She refused vehemently.
Music seemed to her the employment of a child.
She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own.
Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay.
In vain she tried to check, or at all events to accelerate, the tale.
It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach: “Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire.
Come into my room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.” With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the girl.
Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?” She was unprepared for the question.
It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything.
A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done?
A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.” The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door.
A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes.
She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?” “The driver?” “My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.” Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?” “I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.” “I, too, intend to judge him charitably.
But unfortunately I have met the type before.
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first?
Come here and listen to me.
I am only gathering it from his own remarks.
Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another?” “Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude.
There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish.
But we are no farther on with our question.
What do you propose to do?” An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it.
But—as you said—it is my affair.
Mine and his.” “And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?” “Certainly not.
There would be no difficulty.
Whatever you ask him he answers, yes or no; then it is over.
I have been frightened of him.
But now I am not one little bit.” “But we fear him for you, dear.
You are so young and inexperienced, you have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round.
This afternoon, for example, if I had not arrived, what would have happened?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?” “I hadn’t time to think.
You came.” “Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?” “I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off.
She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett.
“You will be seen from the road.” Lucy obeyed.
She was in her cousin’s power.
She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started.
Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man!
We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless.
There is Mr.
Eager, but you do not trust him.
Oh, for your brother!
He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.
Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead.
There are still left some men who can reverence woman.” As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and ranged them upon the pin cushion.
Then she blew into her gloves and said: “It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.” “What train?” “The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?” “At eight.” “Signora Bertolini would be upset.” “We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.” “I expect she will.
However, we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses’ hotel.
Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?” “Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained motionless and silent.
To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome.
Lucy, when admonished, began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte, who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly.
She knelt down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.
But she was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her, but needed her to love.
For it was in ominous tones that she said, after a long pause: “Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?” Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant.
Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: “Charlotte dear, what do you mean?
As if I have anything to forgive!” “You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
I know well how much I vex you at every turn.” “But no—” Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged martyr.
“Ah, but yes!
I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped.
I might have known it would not do.
You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you.
I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.” “Please—” “My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and were often able to leave me at home.
I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary.
You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.” “You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other, heart and soul.
They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own.
“Failed to make you happy; failed in my duty to your mother.
She has been so generous to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.” “But mother will understand.
It is not your fault, this trouble, and it isn’t a disaster either.” “It is my fault, it is a disaster.
She will never forgive me, and rightly.
For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish?” “Every right.” “When I was here for your sake?
If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you.
Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.” Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence.
There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.” The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her.
But in case she should blame you in any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to.
I will never speak of it either to her or to any one.” Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.
Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background.
George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually.
At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since, it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent.
She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed, for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love.
Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters.
Before she reached them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle.
Thus it was that, though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers.
She was still dressed.
It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved.
At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said: “I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.” Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr. Emerson.” His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true.
It can’t all be true.
I want not to be muddled.
I want to grow older quickly.” Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear.
You need all the rest you can get.” In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun.
They were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied.
A poet—none was present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room.
One—a boy of nineteen—was studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano.
From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him what she had written.
And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother.
“I tell you I’m getting fairly sick.” “For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
“Time they did.” “I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.” “It’s his third go, isn’t it?” “Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.” “I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy.
I don’t know how girls manage things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.” “Do you indeed, dear?
How interesting!” “I feel—never mind.” He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse.
I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’” “Yes, mother, you told me.
A jolly good letter.” “I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.
But—’” She stopped reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all.
He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth.
When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.” “Nor me.” “You?” Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?” “He asked me for my permission also.” She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir.
“Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?
What ever did you say?” “I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’” “What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come.
There they still are!” “I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.” “Peeping like that!
Can’t I look out of my own window?” But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves.
For a brief space they were silent.
Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave a nervous gulp.
“Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy.
He practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her?
And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.” “I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.” “I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth.
“There!
Fly into a stew!
I can’t help it—had to say it.
I had to say no.
He ought never to have asked me.” “Ridiculous child!” cried his mother.
“You think you’re so holy and truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit.
Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say?
I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?” “Oh, do keep quiet, mother!
I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.
I tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right.
But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.” “No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the subject, “I shall not keep quiet.
You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.” “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
“I only let out I didn’t like him.
I don’t hate him, but I don’t like him.
What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.” He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“I know his mother; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick the piano!
He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained dissatisfied.
She added: “And he has beautiful manners.” “I liked him till just now.
I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.” “Mr.
Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest.
“I don’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in.” “You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means.
He said: ‘Mr.
Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he meant.
He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking.
Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.” “You never can, dear.
But I can.
You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.” The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it.
But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust.
Cecil praised one too much for being athletic.
Was that it?
Cecil made one talk in one’s own way.
This tired one.
Was that it?
And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow’s cap.
Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself.
He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother.
“‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light.
She keeps that flat abominably—” “Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?” “Don’t interrupt so foolishly.
Where was I?
Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing.
I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything.
But I do not know—’” “Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation.
He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles.
Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds.
But it was transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald.
Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described.
He was medieval.
Like a Gothic statue.
Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism.
A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant.
And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!” “I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals.
They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.
We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the furniture.
“This is indeed a joyous day!
I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy.” “I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat.
She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis.
Then she saw her brother’s face.
Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?” Cecil suggested.
“And I’d stop here and tell my mother.” “We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.” They passed into the sunlight.
Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and descend out of sight by the steps.
They would descend—he knew their ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed, until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical.
He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s.
That day she had seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel.
But Italy worked some marvel in her.
It gave her light, and—which he held more precious—it gave her shadow.
Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence.
She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness.
Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other.
It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the same to him as before.
Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language.
She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her.
He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
The things that really mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy.
His mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he moved to the writing table.
There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many erasures.
He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.
With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table.
The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter.
He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about it none the less.
It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected.
“I represent all that he despises.
Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?” The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
“Mr.
Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse.
Do you suppose that I shall get it?” “I should say so.
Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.” “Pfui!” “I know,” said Cecil.
“I know.
I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.” For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip.
Isn’t this news?” “News?
I don’t understand you,” said Cecil.
“News?” Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field.
He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!” “Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself.
Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen!
Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
But his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question!
To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church!
I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.” “I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly.
“I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board.
Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the right names.
I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery.
It is very remiss of me.
Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.” Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?” “I have no profession,” said Cecil.
“It is another example of my decadence.
My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
I know I ought to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.” “You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe.
“It is a wonderful opportunity, the possession of leisure.” His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally.
He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve.
I daren’t face the healthy person—for example, Freddy Honeychurch.” “Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?” “Admirable.
The sort who has made England what she is.” Cecil wondered at himself.
Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly contrary?
He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea before evening service.” “I suppose Anne never told them you were here.
In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives.
The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?” “I know the faults of Mary.
She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.” “The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small.” They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many.
No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.” “She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree.
At present she has none.” “At present?” “I’m not cynical.
I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle.
Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.” Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?” “Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps.
Oh, I forgot; of course, you knew her before.
No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.” “In what way?” Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string.
Picture number two: the string breaks.” The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically.
At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?” “No.
I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.” “It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst.
He cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken?
What do you mean?” “I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.” The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize.
I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners.
Was this the reception his action would get from the world?
Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly.
“I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.” “Not that.
But you ought to have stopped me.
I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes.
Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with any one; certainly not with you.” “You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?” Mr. Beebe pulled himself together.
Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions.
He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet.
I foresaw at Florence that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended.
I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio.
He did not omit to do so.
“She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her.” “Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?” Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march.
Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried.
He looked at Lucy.
In her presence he could not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.
I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great and small.
I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and mother.
And now I want my tea.” “You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted.
“How dare you be serious at Windy Corner?” He took his tone from her.
There was no more heavy beneficence, no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures.
None of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe.
Away from it, in the solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical.
But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious.
It has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart.
The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed.
Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel sentimental.
Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.
If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true.
Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them greatly.
They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door.
Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance.
Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as a mother-in-law.
As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him.
People congratulated Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid.
They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with the dowagers.
When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?” “I suppose so.
Mother, would it be?” “Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and said: “To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.” “I am so sorry that you were stranded.” “Not that, but the congratulations.
It is so disgusting, the way an engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment.
All those old women smirking!” “One has to go through it, I suppose.
They won’t notice us so much next time.” “But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong.
An engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and should be treated as such.” Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially correct.
The spirit of the generations had smiled through them, rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth.
To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite different—personal love.
Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said.
“Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?” “I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public.
The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic.
Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato.” “Inglese Italianato?” “E un diavolo incarnato!
You know the proverb?” She did not.
Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother.
But Cecil, since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.” “We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?” “It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in, or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?” She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert.
“I don’t see any difference.
Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same place.” “We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap.
“This is me.
That’s Windy Corner.
The rest of the pattern is the other people.
Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.” She leant placidly back.
Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and that’s Mr. Beebe.” “A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.” Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect what they meant.
She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried.
“I consider him far above the average.
I only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful ones, is Mr.
Eager, the English chaplain at Florence.
He was truly insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate.
He was a snob, and so conceited, and he did say such unkind things.” “What sort of things?” “There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife.” “Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing.
Mr.
Eager would never come to the point.
He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.” “Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander?
It was, I believe, chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped.
People pretended he was vulgar, but he certainly wasn’t that.” “Poor old man!
What was his name?” “Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr.
Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know.
I hate him.
I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto.
I hate him.
Nothing can hide a petty nature.
I _hate_ him.” “My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“You’ll blow my head off!
Whatever is there to shout over?
I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen.” He smiled.
There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s moral outburst over Mr.
Eager.
It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine.
He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not in muscular rant.
But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive.
After a moment, he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval.
He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.
He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.
The outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact.
Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I feel I could never live out of it.
When I’m in the country I feel the same about the country.
After all, I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who live amongst them must be the best.
It’s true that in nine cases out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything.
The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions.
Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town.
Do you feel that, Mrs. Honeychurch?” Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled.
She had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either.
Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics.
It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?” “‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?” “Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled spire.
Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church.
In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages.
Some great mansions were at hand, but they were hidden in the trees.
The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement, having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals.
“Albert” was inhabited.
His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace.
“Cissie” was to let.
Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically.
“Summer Street will never be the same again.” As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry.
Now we shall know.
Sir Harry, pull those things down at once!” Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I meant to.
I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss Flack.” “Am I not always right?
She ought to have gone before the contract was signed.
Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s time?” “But what can I do?” He lowered his voice.
“An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden.” “Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully.
He had had full warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory.
He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt.
Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper.
He ventured to differ, however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration.
Sir Harry hinted that a column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin.
He built his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage.
He had failed in his duties to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy landlord.
But it is such an awkward size.
It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.” Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them.
The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously.
“It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.” “Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly.
“That is exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong type of people.
The train service has improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind.
And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?” “Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate.
She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea.
How would you like spinsters?” “My dear Lucy, it would be splendid.
Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.
I heard from them last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.
I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people.
Mr. Beebe knows them, too.
May I tell them to write to you?” “Indeed you may!” he cried.
“Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
How delightful it is!
Extra facilities—please tell them they shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees.
Oh, the agents!
The appalling people they have sent me!
One woman, when I wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance.
As if one cares about that!
And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable.
And oh, the deceit!
I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week.
The deceit of the most promising people.
My dear Lucy, the deceit!” She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all.
I know the type.
Preserve me from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy.
It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down.” “I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very sad thing.” “The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil.
“I haven’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.” “Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.” “It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied.
“I oughtn’t to come with my troubles to young people.
But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no real help.” “Then may I write to my Misses Alan?” “Please!” But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed: “Beware!
They are certain to have canaries.
Sir Harry, beware of canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come.
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.” “Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
If they get drunk, there’s an end of them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off.
If they’re vulgar, they somehow keep it to themselves.
It doesn’t spread so.
Give me a man—of course, provided he’s clean.” Sir Harry blushed.
Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex.
Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction.
He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself.
She was delighted.
Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house.
Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?” “Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.
He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha!
young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!” “I can’t help it.
It would be wrong not to loathe that man.” “He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.” “No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life.
In London he would keep his place.
He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife would give brainless dinner parties.
But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and every one—even your mother—is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt discouraged.
“I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.” “It matters supremely.
Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!
How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
with his bald head and retreating chin!
But let’s forget him.” This Lucy was glad enough to do.
If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape?
For instance, Freddy.
Freddy was neither clever, nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”?
And what would she reply?
Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety enough.
She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps, during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them.
Summer Street lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
“Why is it, Lucy, that you always say the road?
Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?” “Haven’t I?
The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with me in a room.” “A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes.
Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road.
Never in the real country like this.” “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
I have never felt anything of the sort.
You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.” “I don’t know that you aren’t.
I connect you with a view—a certain type of view.
Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?” She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing: “Do you know that you’re right?
I do.
I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room.
How funny!” To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray?
With no view?” “Yes, with no view, I fancy.
Why not?” “I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open air.” She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?” As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees.
She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!” “Why do you call it that?” “I can’t remember why.
I suppose it comes out of some book.
It’s only a puddle now, but you see that stream going through it?
Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful.
Then Freddy used to bathe there.
He is very fond of it.” “And you?” He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed here, too, till I was found out.
Then there was a row.” At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of prudishness within him.
But now?
with his momentary cult of the fresh air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity.
He looked at her as she stood by the pool’s edge.
She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?” “Charlotte,” she murmured.
“She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.” “Poor girl!” She smiled gravely.
A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
“What, Cecil?” “Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me—” He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed.
His courage had gone.
“Yes?” “Up to now I have never kissed you.” She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?” “Of course, you may, Cecil.
You might before.
I can’t run at you, you know.” At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities.
Her reply was inadequate.
She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil.
As he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them.
Such was the embrace.
He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure.
Passion should believe itself irresistible.
It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young man behind the counter would have done?
He recast the scene.
Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness.
For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation.
He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts.
At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.” “What name?” “The old man’s.” “What old man?” “That old man I told you about.
The one Mr.
Eager was so unkind to.” He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had.
Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to.
Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself.
Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs.
Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy.
He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility.
“I cannot think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter.
When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.
The best obtainable.
Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles.
A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia.
Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes.
In this circle, one thought, married, and died.
Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills.
But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high.
You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you.
She returned with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation.
He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad.
He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
Nor did he realize a more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her.
A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved.
For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.” “But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe.
“I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably.
They are coming.
I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried.
“Just because they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing.
And poor Lucy—serve her right—worn to a shadow.” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court.
Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn.
When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring.
“If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count.
I told you not Saturn.” “Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.” “Saturn doesn’t bounce.” “Saturn bounces enough.” “No, he doesn’t.” “Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.” “Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in.
That’s right, Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over the shins!” Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness.
Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt.
He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
But he hated the physical violence of the young.
How right it was!
Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.” “That wasn’t the name—” Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.” “Nonsense, Freddy!
You know nothing about it.” “Nonsense yourself!
I’ve this minute seen him.
He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem!
ahem!
I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’ and slapped him on the back.” “Exactly.
The Miss Alans?” “Rather not.
More like Anderson.” “Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed.
“Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right?
I _said_ don’t interfere with Cissie Villa.
I’m always right.
I’m quite uneasy at being always right so often.” “It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s.
Freddy doesn’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.” “Yes, I do.
I’ve got it.
Emerson.” “What name?” “Emerson.
I’ll bet you anything you like.” “What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly.
“I wish I had never bothered over it at all.” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky.
Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy?
Do you know what Emersons they are?” “I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was democratic.
Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person.
All right, Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother’s a snob.
But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s affectation to pretend there isn’t.” “Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways.
Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man.
Pray, does that satisfy you?” “Oh, yes,” he grumbled.
“And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety.” “_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly.
“Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.” “But has Cecil—” “Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’” She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much.
While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl.
She might well “screech” when she heard that it came partly from her lover.
Mr. Vyse was a tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people.
The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
He diverted it as follows: “The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean?
No, I don’t suppose it will prove to be them.
It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse’s.
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people!
The queerest people!
For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets.
They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa.
Poor little ladies!
So shocked and so pleased.
It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories.
‘My dear sister loves flowers,’ it began.
They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult.
Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets.” “Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister’s face was very red.
She could not recover herself.
Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature—pessimism, et cetera.
Our special joy was the father—such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.
He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Lucy, don’t desert us—go on playing bumble-puppy.
Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place.
That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being there.
Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop?
By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time.” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer.
He suggested that his hostess was mistaken.
At the hint of opposition she warmed.
She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told.
The name escaped her.
What was the name?
Oh, what was the name?
She clasped her knees for the name.
Something in Thackeray.
She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely.
“Don’t be silly.
You always overdo it when you play.” As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
Hitherto truth had come to her naturally.
She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely truthful?
Well, at all events, she must not tell lies.
She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame.
A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.
“Cecil!” “Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window.
He seemed in high spirits.
“I was hoping you’d come.
I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse.
George Meredith’s right—the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa.
Don’t be angry!
Don’t be angry!
You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.” He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said.
“Freddy has told us.
Naughty Cecil!
I suppose I must forgive you.
Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have nice friends of yours.
But you oughtn’t to tease one so.” “Friends of mine?” he laughed.
“But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was.
“Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week.” “What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously.
“I don’t quite understand.” “In the Umbrian Room.
Absolute strangers.
They were admiring Luca Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly.
However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not a little.
They had been to Italy.” “But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends.
I thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—” “Cecil!
No, it’s not fair.
I’ve probably met them before—” He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair.
Anything is fair that punishes a snob.
That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good.
Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with me.
There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things.
I believe in democracy—” “No, you don’t,” she snapped.
“You don’t know what the word means.” He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque.
“No, you don’t!” Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil.
I blame you—I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous.
You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense?
I consider it most disloyal of you.” She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness.
As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded.
He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally.
He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent.
In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse.
His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch.
Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement, met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned.
The Miss Alans were duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held responsible for the failure.
Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived.
Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood.
And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood.
Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood.
But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done.
She was glad that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative.
He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy.
At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do!
I don’t know what I should do without you.” Several days passed.
Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett.
A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not corresponded since they parted in August.
The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased amazingly.
For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical.
Charlotte, unselfish in the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue their tour.
Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs.
Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly.
Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS, “_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA, “I have news of you at last!
Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome.
Puncturing her tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out.
He said his father had just taken the house.
He _said_ he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (?).
He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea.
Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him to enter the house, etc.
That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you have told them already.
Mr. Vyse is so sensitive.
I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome.
I am very sorry about it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me, “Your anxious and loving cousin, “CHARLOTTE.” Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows: “BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE, “Many thanks for your warning.
When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she would blame you for not being always with me.
I have kept that promise, and cannot possibly tell her now.
I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself.
She should have tried at the Rectory.
I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage.
You must see that it would be too absurd.
If the Emersons heard I had complained of them, they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they are not.
I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy Corner at all, but here.
Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your envelope again.
No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately, “L.
M. HONEYCHURCH.” Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not.
Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at?
Miss Bartlett suggested the former.
Perhaps she was right.
It had become a great thing now.
Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago.
She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school.
But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.
It did her no harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors.
The weather was cool, and it did her no harm.
In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people.
The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.
One was tired of everything, it seemed.
One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter.
In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann.
“Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the querulous beauty of the music had died.
She shook her head and played Schumann again.
The melody rose, unprofitably magical.
It broke; it was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave.
The sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of the audience throb.
Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s, had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among many people.
The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.” “Her music always was wonderful.” “Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean.
She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.” “Italy has done it.” “Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her.
“It is just possible.
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.” “But her music!” he exclaimed.
“The style of her!
How she kept to Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schumann was right for this evening.
Schumann was the thing.
Do you know, mother, I shall have our children educated just like Lucy.
Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then—not till then—let them come to London.
I don’t believe in these London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.” “Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s room.
Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself.
She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.” “Bad dreams?” “Just dreams.” The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You should have heard us talking about you, dear.
He admires you more than ever.
Dream of that.” Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed.
Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed.
As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.” “M’m.” “They might amuse you.” Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe.
“They are worth it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
“Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!” “I’ve brought someone to see you.” “I’ll be down in a minute.” The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered.
“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment.
What have they got?
Byron.
Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad.
Never heard of it.
The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it.
Gibbon.
Hullo!
dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.” “Mr.
Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.” “I know.
Isn’t it jolly?
I like that.
I’m certain that’s the old man’s doing.” “How very odd of him!” “Surely you agree?” But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.” “The same as Lucy’s got.” “Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?” “She came back yesterday.” “I suppose she had a good time?” “Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book.
“She and Cecil are thicker than ever.” “That’s good hearing.” “I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.” Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks.
She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books.
Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
Cecil says—” “What on earth are those people doing upstairs?
Emerson—we think we’ll come another time.” George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.” Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face wanted washing.
At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe.” “Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do?
how d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard.
But I’m afraid it will only act between men.
Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How do you do?
Come and have a bathe’?
And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.” “I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.
I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.” “We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you place in the past, is really yet to come.
We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.” Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead.
We despise the body less than women do.
But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.” “I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once.
But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
It is our heritage.” “Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.” “How do you do?
Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty.
I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He has been most kind.
He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
Ah, this wind!
You do well to bathe.
Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!” “Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy.
“I must—that is to say, I have to—have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.” “_Call_, my lad?
Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
Call on your grandmother!
Listen to the wind among the pines!
Yours is a glorious country.” Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr.
Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval.
It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, George.
Why do you dawdle talking?
Bring them back to tea.
Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his office.
I can’t believe he’s well.” George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him.
“It is only a pond, don’t you know.
I dare say you are used to something better.” “Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.” Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
How glorious it was!
For a little time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
He spoke of Florence.
George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse!
Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?” “I did not.
Miss Lavish told me.” “When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of Coincidence.’” No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.” To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is.
I have reflected.
It is Fate.
Everything is Fate.
We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart.
The twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—” “You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman.
“Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
Don’t say, ‘I didn’t do this,’ for you did it, ten to one.
Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?” “Italy.” “And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?” “National Gallery.” “Looking at Italian art.
There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.” “It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George.
“But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.” Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is still to write.” Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that you have come.” Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond.
I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe.
“No apologies are necessary for the pond.” George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid?
I love willow-herb in seed.
What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
Very charming, very charming.” “Mr.
Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George.
Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
It was necessary to use his muscles.
It was necessary to keep clean.
Mr. Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful, water’s simply ripping.” “Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful.
Mr. Beebe, do.” “Apooshoo, kouf.” Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
How glorious it was!
The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Götterdämmerung.
But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
They began to play.
Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
A little deferentially, they splashed George.
He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: “No.
We are what matters.
Without us shall no enterprise begin.
To us shall all flesh turn in the end.” “A try!
A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a kick.
“Goal!” “Goal!” “Pass!” “Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat!
No, that’s enough, Freddy.
Dress now.
No, I say!” But the two young men were delirious.
Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
“Hi!
Steady on!
I see people coming you fellows!” Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi!
hi!
_Ladies!_” Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
Still, they did not hear Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Whoever were those unfortunate people?
Oh, dears, look away!
And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?” “Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
Cecil, Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—” No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently “minded.” “I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.” “This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.” They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
“I can’t be trodden on, can I?” “Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you!
What miserable management!
Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?” “Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and if another fellow—” “Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
Come, Lucy.” They turned.
“Oh, look—don’t look!
Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
How unfortunate again—” For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken.
“I’ve swallowed a pollywog.
It wriggleth in my tummy.
I shall die—Emerson you beast, you’ve got on my bags.” “Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
“And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.” “Mother, do come away,” said Lucy.
“Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.” “Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed.
Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called: “Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
Hullo!” “Bow, Lucy; better bow.
Whoever is it?
I shall bow.” Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away.
On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for youth.
Chapter XIII How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview!
But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume.
Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent.
She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life.
A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much.
“I will bow,” she had thought.
“I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom?
To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.
It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.
Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and he did not want to be seen.
He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside.
He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done.
Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock.
Miss Bartlett, indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory.
Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with Cecil?” The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.” “Perhaps he’s tired.” Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.” “I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.” “Cecil has told you to think so.
You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.” “Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?” “Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?” “Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble ahead.
“It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him sometimes seem—” “Oh, rubbish!
If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother!
I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!” “Not in that way.
At times I could wring her neck.
But not in that way.
No.
It is the same with Cecil all over.” “By-the-by—I never told you.
I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London.” This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me.
No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.” “I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to.
But he does not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.” “Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?” “You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.” “Then why didn’t he leave the room?
Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone’s pleasure?” “We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy.
Something had enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form.
The two civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes.
Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he had succeeded.
And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother—” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
Go.” She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window.
It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.
Now, as in the winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes.
One connected the landing window with depression.
No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly.
And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.
She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.” “My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been!
You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public.
It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else.
Do be more careful.
You forget the place is growing half suburban.” “I say, is anything on to-morrow week?” “Not that I know of.” “Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.” “Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.” “What’s wrong with the court?
They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered new balls.” “I meant _it’s_ better not.
I really mean it.” He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper.
Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans.
Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making!
I have something to say to you.
Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes.
I really can’t stop.
I must dress too.” “How’s Charlotte?” “All right.” “Lucy!” The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?” “Her _what?_” “Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?” “I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly.
“I shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.” Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out.
She did not.
She said: “Come here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life.
It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil.
Cecil despised their methods—perhaps rightly.
At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven.
Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
Then Freddy said: “Lucy, what’s Emerson like?” “I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?” “Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.” “He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly.
I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.” “Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter.” “One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie.
“Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.” “Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.” “She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily.
The remark was a happy one, for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print.
Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath.
But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness.
There were too many ghosts about.
The original ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr.
Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes.
It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s.
How is she?” “I tore the thing up.” “Didn’t she say how she was?
How does she sound?
Cheerful?” “Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.” “Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler.
I know myself how water preys upon one’s mind.
I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the meat.” Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish.
I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long.” It was more than her nerves could stand.
And she could not protest violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded.
“It’s impossible.
We can’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is.
Freddy’s got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare.
It simply can’t be done.” “Nonsense!
It can.” “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
Not otherwise.” “Minnie can sleep with you.” “I won’t have her.” “Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.” “Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy.
“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.” “No, I don’t.
And no more does Cecil.
She gets on our nerves.
You haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good.
So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come.” “Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two.
You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers.
You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.” Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike,” put in Freddy.
“She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.” “I know, dear.
She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return.” But Lucy hardened her heart.
It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She had tried herself too often and too recently.
One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth.
She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother.
I don’t like Charlotte.
I admit it’s horrid of me.” “From your own account, you told her as much.” “Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
She flurried—” The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the places she had known as a child.
The Sacred Lake would never be the same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner.
How would she fight against ghosts?
For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care for eggs.
I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.” Cecil frowned again.
Oh, these Honeychurches!
Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact.
“May me and Lucy get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.” Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room—something with no view, anything.
Her love to Lucy.
And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
She never gazed inwards.
If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
She was nervous at night.
When she talked to George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
Once she had suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious.
Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
She loved Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
Standing between Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his crudities in time.
I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.” Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits.
He laughs more.” “Yes,” replied the clergyman.
“He is waking up.” That was all.
But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs. Honeychurch drove to meet her.
She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“I have upset everything.
Bursting in on young people!
But I insist on paying for my cab up.
Grant that, at any rate.” “Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.” “I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather.
Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.” Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
Only sovereigns and pennies.
Could any one give her change?
Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But who am I to give the sovereign to?” “Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.” Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid.
A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
I should practically be robbing the one who lost.” “Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil.
“So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.” “Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
“How is that, Mr. Vyse?” “Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab.
Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.” Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy.
He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
“I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid.” “Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.” “But I don’t see—” They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you.
I’m done.
I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me.
Ow!
What about Mr. Floyd’s ten shillings?
Ow!
No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.” “I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
“Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
A shilling was it?
Can any one give me change for half a crown?” “I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign.
No, give me up that sovereign.
I’ll get Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning.” “Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?” “No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
“Let me see—a sovereign’s worth of silver.” She escaped into the kitchen.
Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were too uncanny.
It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t.
Here is your money—all shillings, except two half-crowns.
Would you count it?
You can settle your debt nicely now.” Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source.” “Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle.
“George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?” Miss Bartlett considered.
“For instance, the driver.
I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.” Lucy shuddered a little.
“We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren’t careful.
How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?” “We must think of every possibility.” “Oh, it’s all right.” “Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows.
In fact, he is certain to know.” “I don’t care if he does.
I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.” “To contradict it?” “No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best.
Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
Ladies are certainly different.” “Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully.
“You kind, anxious thing.
What _would_ you have me do?
First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say, ‘Tell’.
Which is it to be?
Quick!” Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest.
I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
You will never forgive me.” “Shall we go out, then.
They will smash all the china if we don’t.” For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again.
Have you seen the young one yet?” “Yes, I have.” “What happened?” “We met at the Rectory.” “What line is he taking up?” “No line.
He talked about Italy, like any other person.
It is really all right.
What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way.
He really won’t be any nuisance, Charlotte.” “Once a cad, always a cad.
That is my poor opinion.” Lucy paused.
“Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
It was a new one from Smith’s library.
Her mother must have returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
I don’t think we ought to blame him very much.
It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
He has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into tears.
He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big railways—not a porter!
and runs down to his father for week-ends.
Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
There!
Now for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm.
“Suppose we don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.” Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
Explanations took place, and in the midst of them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain.
Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most of the days of that year.
In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold.
Up on the heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.
Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path.
From the house came incoherent sounds, as of females preparing for worship.
“The men say they won’t go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her, no nonsense”—“Anne!
Mary!
Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine.
Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously.
The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender shadow.
But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window.
Her new cerise dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan.
At her throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an engagement ring.
Her eyes are bent to the Weald.
She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.
In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills.
“Lucy!
Lucy!
What’s that book?
Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?” “It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.” “But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.” Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a Loggia.
She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up.
It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil had said, “What!
you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?” She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.
I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child?
Minnie!
That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!)
Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late.
Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse, never the carriage.
“Where’s Charlotte?
Run up and hurry her.
Why is she so long?
She had nothing to do.
She never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses!
Minnie!” Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting.
As usual, she didn’t see why.
Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men?
The young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words.
Mrs. Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but sovereigns and half crowns.
Could any one give me—” “Yes, easily.
Jump in.
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock!
You put us all to shame.” “If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully.
She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse.
The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
“Good-bye!
Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering.
On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation.
He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.
All that he said on this subject pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church.
There was a line of carriages down the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa.
To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother.
“Unless the young man considers that he knows me already.” He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally.
Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how glad he was that she was going to be married.
She said yes, she was glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice; she had never known him offended before.
He added: “We find, though, that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing.
I am very much upset about it.” “I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,” said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further.
“He thought we should be artistic.
He is disappointed.” “And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up.
What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly.
She must avoid censuring Cecil.
For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned, though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says.
He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall.
Yet it does seem so unkind.” “There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“That’s exactly what I say.
Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?” “There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,” he continued in measured tones.
“We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.
Choose a place where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!” “Eh—?” “I see you’re going to be clever.
I hope you didn’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy.” George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
“He behaved that way to me.
It is his philosophy.
Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first.” “What _do_ you mean?
No, never mind what you mean.
Don’t explain.
He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
Do you play tennis?
Do you mind tennis on Sunday—?” “George mind tennis on Sunday!
George, after his education, distinguish between Sunday—” “Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.
No more do I. That’s settled.
Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased.” He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans.” “I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck.
The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the morning sun?
She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.” “Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady.
Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow.
It was the pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow.
Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered.
He said: “I—I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house.
Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them.
“George has been in such good spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.” Lucy caught her cousin’s eye.
Something in its mute appeal made her reckless.
“Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven.
Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy.
All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things.
It was not an exploit.
He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her hand to her cheek.
“He does not love me.
No.
How terrible if he did!
But he has not told.
He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right.
It’s a secret between us two for ever.
Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room.
The secret, big or little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world.
Thus she interpreted her joy.
She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so safe.
As he helped her out of the carriage, she said: “The Emersons have been so nice.
George Emerson has improved enormously.” “How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them, and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth.
For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected.
He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are.
George Emerson is coming up this afternoon.
He is a most interesting man to talk to.
Only don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks.
Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal.
Generally Lucy was depressed at meals.
Some one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will not last, this cheerfulness.
In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee.
Her mother would always sit there, her brother here.
The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would never be hidden behind the western hills.
After luncheon they asked her to play.
She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.
Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.” She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round.
There George was.
He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
Cecil should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson.
Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.
She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano.
“I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.” “Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil.
“I will not spoil the set.” He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil.
I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s Emerson.” George corrected him: “I am not bad.” One looked down one’s nose at this.
“Then certainly I won’t play,” said Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse.
You had much better not play.
Much better not.” Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would play.
“I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall back on Lucy.
There is no other way out of it.
Lucy, go and change your frock.” Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature.
She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon.
As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner.
She liked music, but how much better tennis seemed.
How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms.
Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child.
George served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
The hills stood out above its radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara.
She might be forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her.
He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others.
He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke.
When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.” “What fun, Cecil!
Read away.
Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!” “Do you mind being beaten?” She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a splendid player, though.
The light was behind you, and it was in my eyes.” “I never said I was.” “Why, you did!” “You didn’t attend.” “You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house.
We all exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.” “‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset.
Leonora was speeding—’” Lucy interrupted.
“Leonora?
Is Leonora the heroine?
Who’s the book by?” “Joseph Emery Prank.
‘Sunset.
Leonora speeding across the square.
Pray the saints she might not arrive too late.
Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it now—’” Lucy burst into laughter.
“‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed!
Why it’s Miss Lavish!
It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under somebody else’s name.” “Who may Miss Lavish be?” “Oh, a dreadful person—Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?” Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up.
“Of course I do.
I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street.
It was she who told me that you lived here.” “Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean something else.
She watched his head, which was almost resting against her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening.
“No wonder the novel’s bad,” she added.
“I never liked Miss Lavish.
But I suppose one ought to read it as one’s met her.” “All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature.
“Every one writes for money in these days.” “Oh, Cecil—!” “It is so.
I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow.
The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her.
She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?” “I never notice much difference in views.” “What do you mean?” “Because they’re all alike.
Because all that matters in them is distance and air.” “H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.” “I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up.
Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.” He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured.
“I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again.
I’m so sorry he’s not so well.” “No, he isn’t well.” “There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil.
“Also that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.” “Mr.
Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?” “None.
Why?” “You spoke of ‘us.’” “My mother, I was meaning.” Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!” “I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” “I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.
It is the first thing that I remember.” Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after tennis—he didn’t do.
He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.” “Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.” “No—read away.
I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud.
If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.” This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him.
It put their visitor in the position of a prig.
Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr.
Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book.
Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked.
But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning.
“Find me chapter two, if it isn’t bothering you.” Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.” She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.” He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone.
Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village.
The season was spring.’” Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose, for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read.
He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence, while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets.
All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’” Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use.
No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’” “This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last.
She thought a disaster was averted.
But when they entered the shrubbery it came.
The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring.
That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove.
Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I must write some letters,” and went up to her room.
Then she prepared for action.
Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty.
Perhaps there never is such a contest.
It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first aim was to defeat herself.
As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been.
Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him.
The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.
In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
“Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?” Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.
“There is a scene in it.
The hero and heroine make love.
Do you know about that?” “Dear—?” “Do you know about it, please?” she repeated.
“They are on a hillside, and Florence is in the distance.” “My good Lucia, I am all at sea.
I know nothing about it whatever.” “There are violets.
I cannot believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her?
I have thought before speaking; it _must_ be you.” “Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.” Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved.
“Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t put that in her book?” Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it.
Yes.” “Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” “So you did tell?” “I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of conversation—” “But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell mother?” “I will never forgive Eleanor.
She has betrayed my confidence.” “Why did you tell her, though?
This is a most serious thing.” Why does any one tell anything?
The question is eternal, and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response.
She had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again.
Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes?
Behind Cecil’s back as we were walking up the garden.” Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now?
Can you tell me?” “Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day.
Fancy if your prospects—” “I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word.
“I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.” It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince.
“However,” said the girl, despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done.
You have put me in a most awkward position.
How am I to get out of it?” Miss Bartlett could not think.
The days of her energy were over.
She was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that.
She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him?
I can’t tell mother now—owing to you.
Nor Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you.
I am caught up every way.
I think I shall go mad.
I have no one to help me.
That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.” Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing.
What’s to be _done?_ We women go maundering on.
What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?” “I always said he was a cad, dear.
Give me credit for that, at all events.
From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a bath.” “Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong!
We’ve both made a muddle of it.
George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he to be left unpunished, or isn’t he?
I want to know.” Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless.
Her own exposure had unnerved her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain.
She moved feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?” “Willingly would I move heaven and earth—” “I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously.
“Will you speak to him?
It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word.” “Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.” “It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture.
“No one will help me.
I will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below.
“Found the lost ball?
Good man!
Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you!
I admire you—” They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul.
Her anger faded at the sight of him.
Ah!
The Emersons were fine people in their way.
She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying: “Freddy has taken him into the dining-room.
The others are going down the garden.
Come.
Let us get this over quickly.
Come.
I want you in the room, of course.” “Lucy, do you mind doing it?” “How can you ask such a ridiculous question?” “Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand.
“I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded.
She remembered their last evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss Bartlett’s toque on the door.
She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time.
Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying.
“The jam’s jolly good.” George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room.
As she entered he stopped, and said: “No—nothing to eat.” “You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants.
Where’s mother?” “She’s started on her Sunday writing.
She’s in the drawing-room.” “That’s all right.
You go away.” He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table.
Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech.
She just said: “I can’t have it, Mr. Emerson.
I cannot even talk to you.
Go out of this house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door.
“I hate a row.
Go please.” “What—” “No discussion.” “But I can’t—” She shook her head.
“Go, please.
I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.” “You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t mean that you are going to marry that man?” The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her.
“You are merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse.
He’s only for an acquaintance.
He is for society and cultivated talk.
He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.” It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss—” “No, but have you ever?
He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.
It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.
I would never have let myself go.
But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters.
Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.
That is the man all over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find.
Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to settle whether you were shocked or no.
Cecil all over again.
He daren’t let a woman decide.
He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.
Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon.
Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’ because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control.
I’m not ashamed.
I don’t apologize.
But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you.
Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly?
But therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.” Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson.
Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.” And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality.
He said: “Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary.
“I’m the same kind of brute at bottom.
This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He thought.
“Yes—really in a better way.
I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards her.
“Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain.
I have cared for you since that man died.
I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun.
As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered.
I called.
I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.” “And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm.
“Does he not matter?
That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly?
A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?” He said: “It is our last chance.
I shall do all that I can.” And as if he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening.
“You wouldn’t stop us this second time if you understood,” he said.
“I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.” Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though demolishing some invisible obstacle.
She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
“It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really.
It is that love and youth matter intellectually.” In silence the two women watched him.
His last remark, they knew, was nonsense, but was he going after it or not?
Would not he, the cad, the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish?
No.
He was apparently content.
He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house.
Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!” Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet.
“Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the latter.
One more fuss through with you, Charlotte.
Many thanks.
I think, though, that this is the last.
My admirer will hardly trouble me again.” And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish: “Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it?
Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really.
It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.” “Let’s go down to them.” But, once in the open air, she paused.
Some emotion—pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring.
That something or other mattered intellectually?
A leaf, violently agitated, danced past her, while other leaves lay motionless.
That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy!
There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll hurry.” “Mr.
Emerson has had to go.” “What a nuisance!
That spoils the four.
I say, Cecil, do play, do, there’s a good chap.
It’s Floyd’s last day.
Do play tennis with us, just this once.” Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete.
As you well remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you.” The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes.
How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement.
Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered.
He had nothing to say.
He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things over.
We are too different.
I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.” It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—” “I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
“My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.” “I don’t understand you.
You aren’t like yourself.
You’re tired, Lucy.” “Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once.
“That is exactly like you.
You always think women don’t mean what they say.” “Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.” “What if I do?
It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth.
I can’t marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.” “You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches.
But give me a moment’s time.” He closed his eyes.
“You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.” It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
To bring on the crisis, she said: “There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.” “I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never could play.
I don’t understand a word you say.” “You can play well enough to make up a four.
I thought it abominably selfish of you.” “No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis.
Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
You talked of our wedding at lunch—at least, you let me talk.” “I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly.
“I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
Of course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.” She developed this position.
“Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted to be my husband?
I don’t think so.
You don’t like Freddy, nor my mother.
There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point.
They have to-day.
I see clearly.
I must speak.
That’s all.” “I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently.
“I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
It’s all too horrible.” “What’s the good of a scene?” “No good.
But surely I have a right to hear a little more.” He put down his glass and opened the window.
From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy or any one might be outside.” He obeyed.
“I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved me!” “I did not,” she said.
“I thought I did at first.
I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.” He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
She had counted on his being petty.
It would have made things easier for her.
By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently.
I dare say you are right not to.
But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.” “Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort who can’t know any one intimately.” A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that.
But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
It is that, more or less.
When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always protecting me.” Her voice swelled.
“I won’t be protected.
I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
To shield me is an insult.
Can’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
A woman’s place!
You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
That’s why I break off my engagement.
You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause.
Then Cecil said with great emotion: “It is true.” “True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word.
It is a revelation.
It is—I.” “Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.” He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true.
I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
You are even greater than I thought.” She withdrew a step.
“I’m not going to worry you.
You are far too good to me.
I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
I have never known you till this evening.
I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—” “What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance.
She cried: “If you think I am in love with some one else, you are very much mistaken.” “Of course I don’t think that.
You are not that kind, Lucy.” “Oh, yes, you do think it.
It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting, brutal!
As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.” He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past.
I shall never say it again.
You have taught me better.” She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity.
I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.” “All right, Cecil, that will do.
Don’t apologize to me.
It was my mistake.” “It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke.
“I must actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really am.
Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
Will you shake hands?” “Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
“Good-night, Cecil.
Good-bye.
That’s all right.
I’m sorry about it.
Thank you very much for your gentleness.” “Let me light your candle, shall I?” They went into the hall.
“Thank you.
Good-night again.
God bless you, Lucy!” “Good-bye, Cecil.” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry.
In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself.
She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within.
They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
As the years pass, they are censured.
Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one.
The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill.
On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy Corner,—he laughed.
The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.
The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road.
So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly.
Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.
One might laugh at the house, but one never shuddered.
Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip.
He had heard from the Miss Alans.
These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed their plans.
They were going to Greece instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter.
Of course, Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train.
But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.” Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her.
She would see the fun of it, and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty.
Though she was hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she could not play the piano as she did.
He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been understood.
This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been illustrated by facts.
Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.
Therefore it must be the horse, who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy.
They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs.
Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station.
They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it.
“Isn’t it wonderful?
Isn’t it romance?
Most certainly they will go to Constantinople.
They are taken in a snare that cannot fail.
They will end by going round the world.” Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious!
I never notice it in you young people; you do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing.
‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn!
No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans.
They want the Pension Keats.” “I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you any matches?” “I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?” “Never.” “Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit.
I haven’t been to Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my friends going.
It is altogether too big for our little lot.
Don’t you think so?
Italy is just about as much as we can manage.
Italy is heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus.
All right, Freddy—I am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
“I was saying, if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience.
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me.
There the contrast is just as much as I can realize.
But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the victoria.” “You’re quite right,” said Cecil.
“Greece is not for our little lot”; and he got in.
Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really.
And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box, which had not been returned.
As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
Cecil’s hard hit.
Lucy won’t marry him.
If you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down.” “But when—” “Late last night.
I must go.” “Perhaps they won’t want me down there.” “No—go on.
Good-bye.” “Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart.
The house was again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata.
He hesitated a moment, but went down the garden as requested.
There he found a mournful company.
It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of assistance.
At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe?
Gracious what a mess everything is!
Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.” Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her.
“You have worried them as much as they can stand.
Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly.
I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.” “Oh, must you?
Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it.” Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about for, either in the house or out of it.” Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.
As they walked up the garden, the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother.
Or will she come with us?” “I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.” “They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has gone, and Freddy won’t play with me.
In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.” “Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur.
“Go and put on your boots.” He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart.
She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do?
Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive.
Would you come too?” “I don’t think I will, thank you.” “No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.” Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!” “Yes.” “I met them on the hill.
Your brother told me.” “Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed.
Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.” “Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have done the right thing.” “So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.” “I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.” “So does mother.
Mother minds dreadfully.” “I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.
It was really a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.” “Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he?
I gathered that he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.” “Boys are so odd.” Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor.
Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel.
Mr. Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action, so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan.
That was really what brought me over.
I thought it might amuse you all.” “How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.
After a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with “Going abroad?
When do they start?” “Next week, I gather.” “Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
Always complaisant, he put the letter away.
But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!
How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad!” “I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast!” She laughed heartily.
“Oh, delightful!
I wish they’d take me.” “Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel?
Perhaps George Emerson is right.
He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’” “Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople.
I have always longed to go to Constantinople.
Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?” Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm.
She had always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed.
He saw, to his surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends, after Cissie Villa.” “Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would give anything to go with them.” “Would your mother spare you again so soon?
You have scarcely been home three months.” “She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement.
“I simply _must_ go away.
I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
“Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away?
I didn’t realize at the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.” “You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—” “Yes, yes.
I knew you’d understand.” Mr. Beebe did not quite understand.
Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family?
Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her.
Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying.
He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down.” “I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all.
Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so masterful.
I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
He would improve me in places where I can’t be improved.
Cecil won’t let a woman decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t.
What nonsense I do talk!
But that is the kind of thing.” “It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you.
I do sympathize and agree most profoundly.
I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?” “But I must go somewhere!” she cried.
“I have been worrying all the morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with clenched fists, and repeated: “I must!
And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
You all think much too highly of me.
I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased.
“I must get away, ever so far.
I must know my own mind and where I want to go.” “Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out of the front-door.
He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource.
She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be.
I know all about it.
The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak.” Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett.
As he had put it to himself at Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
He assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter drop.” “I wonder.” “It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street.
It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at the present moment.” Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows.
Death is a strong word—surely too strong.
There was no question of tragedy.
He said: “Of course, Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she chooses.
Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.” “I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly.
“Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you.
One cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy.
A chance word to a chattering friend, and—” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
A rector lives in a web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he will regard them.
He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately?
I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish.
It is odd how we of that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another’s lives.
Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.
We must really give the Signora a testimonial.” And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern.
On the summit they paused.
The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue.
Summer was retreating.
The wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven.
The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery.
Mr. Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.” They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.
That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably.
Mr. Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces.
They would hand the child her food through the window.
Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past.
I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit.
She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her.
But the future.
Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again.
“I don’t know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.” Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.” To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you.
In it I spy Lucy’s salvation.” “Really.
Now, why?” “She wanted to leave Windy Corner.” “I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to say—selfish.” “It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire a change.” Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect misses.
Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced.
Perhaps she must have a change.
I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand these things.
But why need she go as far as Greece?” “You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner.
“Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?)
Why not Tunbridge Wells?
Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning.
I cannot help her.
I will say no more.
Perhaps I have already said too much.
I am not to talk.
I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.” Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance.
I know too well that I get on Lucy’s nerves.
Our tour was a failure.
She wanted to leave Florence, and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.” “Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe.
“I want your advice.” “Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to him, though familiar to Lucy.
“I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?” Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd woman really did know.
“She must not stop here a moment, and we must keep quiet till she goes.
I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already.
Only, Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone.
If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—” “Otherwise—?” “Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.” Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude.
The tavern sign—a beehive trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him.
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another man” that would have attracted a grosser mind.
He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form.
Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry.
His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.
“They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure.
In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity.
The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement.
Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the action of others.
The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey.
He conversed on indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants; Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could literature influence life?
Windy Corner glimmered.
In the garden, Mrs. Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly.
“This comes of putting off.
We might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece.
I don’t know what the world’s coming to.” “Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must.
Come up to the house and let’s talk it over.
Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?” “Mr.
Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.” “So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good.
Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone.
It was expensive and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed.
Nor would Charlotte have succeeded.
The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right.
It must be something I can’t understand.
Lucy!
Let’s tell her.
Lucy!” “She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said.
He opened the door, and heard the words of a song: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.” “I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.” “Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——” “It’s a song that Cecil gave her.
How odd girls are!” “What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly.
She went into the drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.” Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a bit.” “And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you.” “Oh, splendid!
Oh, thank you!” Mr. Beebe followed.
Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys.
She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness.
Her mother bent over her.
Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_, in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and therefore ignored by the art of to-day.
Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens,” she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.” “Mr.
Beebe knows my rude ways.” “It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he.
“Go on.” “It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly.
“I forget why—harmony or something.” “I suspected it was unscholarly.
It’s so beautiful.” “The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten.
Why throw up the sponge?” “How stupidly you talk!” said his sister.
The _Santa Conversazione_ was broken up.
After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.” “Stop thine ear against the singer—” “Wait a minute; she is finishing.” “From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” “I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear.
She had behaved splendidly, and he had helped her.
He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl’s life.
If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—” Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly.
He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned: “Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX Lying to Mr. Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial England.
They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books, mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.
Miss Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one’s face in the train.
Lucy promised, a little depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.
A gentleman is such a stand-by.” Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine continued.
“It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.
But perhaps he will come out and join you later on.” “Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off.
I do so long to see him.” “No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“She doesn’t like it.” “No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really?
How funny!
I should have thought that in this case—” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going?
It is such a pleasure to have met you!” They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right.
We just got through that time.” But her mother was annoyed.
“I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it.
There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.” Lucy had plenty to say in reply.
She described the Miss Alans’ character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?” “Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then.
It’s much pleasanter.
How wet it is!
Let’s turn in here.” “Here” was the British Museum.
Mrs. Honeychurch refused.
If they must take shelter, let it be in a shop.
Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.
Let’s go to Mudie’s.
I’ll buy a guide-book.” “You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this hole-and-corner work.
You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute.
But why not announce it?
Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?” “It’s only for a few days.” “But why at all?” Lucy was silent.
She was drifting away from her mother.
It was quite easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the incidental advantage of being true.
But she could not say it.
She disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors—Light.
Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent.
She was thinking, “My daughter won’t answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me.
Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.” This was perfectly true.
Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no longer.
It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.
She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk!
Of course I’m not tired of Windy Corner.” “Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?” She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.” “Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?” “Hush, mother!
People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s.
She bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
You see, I come into my money next year.” Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed “eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear.
“I’ve seen the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy.
I have seen so little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like to-day, but to stop.
I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl.” “And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police.
And call it a Mission—when no one wants you!
And call it Duty—when it means that you can’t stand your own home!
And call it Work—when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is!
And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.” “I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys.
But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well.
Take your independence and be gone.
Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.” Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed.
“How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!” “_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.
“More every moment.” “I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike.” “Well, I see the likeness.
The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters.” “What rubbish!
And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you asked her to stop.
I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.” Lucy clenched her teeth.
“My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked Charlotte to stop.
I wish you would keep to the point.” And the conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station.
It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy.
Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful.
“The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked.
For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old mother.
“We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining.
Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was blurred by the soft road.
“_Can’t_ we have the hood down?” she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck.
But now that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?” “It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?” “Yes, miss, they have gone.” Lucy sank back.
The carriage stopped at the Rectory.
She got out to call for Miss Bartlett.
So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary.
Waste!
That word seemed to sum up the whole of life.
Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded her mother.
Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible.
Other people had.
When the maid opened the door, she was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a great favour: might she go to church?
Mr. Beebe and his mother had already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily.
“I forgot it was Friday.
Let’s all go.
Powell can go round to the stables.” “Lucy dearest—” “No church for me, thank you.” A sigh, and they departed.
The church was invisible, but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour.
This was a stained window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation.
Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?
There was only that one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait, sir.” Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips.
George she had faced, and could have faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry!
George is so sorry!
He thought he had a right to try.
I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first.
He ought not to have tried.
I knew nothing about it at all.” If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand.
“But you must not scold him.” Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love.
I said: ‘When love comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind.
No.
Passion is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my day is over, and though there is the result.
Poor boy!
He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that whatever you felt you did not mean.
Yet”—his voice gathered strength: he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?” Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries.
Holding it up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son.” “But you do remember it?” “He has misbehaved himself from the first.” “I only was told that he loved you last Sunday.
I never could judge behaviour.
I—I—suppose he has.” Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to him.
His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said.
“I am glad he is sorry.
Do you know what he did?” “Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction.
“He only tried when he should not have tried.
You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are going to marry the man you love.
Do not go out of George’s life saying he is abominable.” “No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong.
I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all.
My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late—” “Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?” “Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.” “As his mother did.” “But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr.
Emerson_—what are you talking about?” “When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round.
She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered.
“Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in again!
A judgement!
And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church!
Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch?
Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever?” “I don’t know,” gasped Lucy.
“I don’t understand this sort of thing.
I was not meant to understand it.” “But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his principles.
I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was well she was ill.
He made her think about sin, and she went under thinking about it.” It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man.
“I did hold firm.” And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what cost!—he had won a victory over them.
“My boy shall go back to the earth untouched.” She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill. “Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present.
“George last Sunday—no, not ill: just gone under.
He is never ill.
But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
It was always touch and go.
He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live.
He will never think anything worth while.
You remember that church at Florence?” Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible.
Then we took the house here, and he goes bathing with your brother, and became better.
You saw him bathing?” “I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair.
I am deeply sorry about it.” “Then there came something about a novel.
I didn’t follow it at all; I had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old.
Ah, well, one must have failures.
George comes down to-morrow, and takes me up to his London rooms.
He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be where he is.” “Mr.
Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my account.
I am going to Greece.
Don’t leave your comfortable house.” It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled.
“How good everyone is!
And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning and heard I was going!
Here I am so comfortable with a fire.” “Yes, but you won’t go back to London.
It’s absurd.” “I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he can’t.
He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t.
I’ve been bother enough to the world by now.
I can’t have you moving out of your house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my account.
You must stop!
I am just going to Greece.” “All the way to Greece?” Her manner altered.
“To Greece?” “So you must stop.
You won’t talk about this business, I know.
I can trust you both.” “Certainly you can.
We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the life that you have chosen.” “I shouldn’t want—” “I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George?
No, it was wrong of George to try.
We have pushed our beliefs too far.
I fancy that we deserve sorrow.” She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling.
To Lucy who could not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still.
I think I will sit in the carriage.” “Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.” “Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you.
And what were you saying about going abroad?” She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands.
Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you.
I hope—it isn’t because George spoke that you are both going?” “No.” “I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.” “Thank you.” At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church.
His cassock was covered with rain.
“That’s all right,” he said kindly.
“I counted on you two keeping each other company.
It’s pouring again.
The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it.
Did Powell go round?” “I think so; I’ll see.” “No—of course, I’ll see.
How are the Miss Alans?” “Very well, thank you.” “Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?” “I—I did.” “Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the two Miss Alans?
Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm.
I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely.
“I made a slip.
Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England.” Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man.
To George, to Cecil, she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece.
And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving him?
You are leaving the man you love?” “I—I had to.” “Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?” Terror came over her, and she lied again.
She made the long, convincing speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more.
He heard her in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.
It seems to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.” She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world.
It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so dreadful.
It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the things that I might have avoided.
We can help one another but little.
I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle.
Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren’t?
Do you remember before, when you refused the room with the view?
Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent.
“Don’t trust me, Miss Honeychurch.
Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was still silent.
“‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’ I think he puts it well.
Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean.
You love George!” And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
“You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
You won’t marry the other man for his sake.” “How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man.” “But you are.” She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.
It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way.
You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat.
I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and _for which_ you marry.
I know that, with George, you will find them, and that you love him.
Then be his wife.
He is already part of you.
Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part.
You will wish that it was.
You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.
I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the body.
Ah!
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that!
Ah!
for a little directness to liberate the soul!
Your soul, dear Lucy!
I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round.
But we have souls.
I cannot say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining yours.
I cannot bear it.
It is again the darkness creeping in; it is hell.” Then he checked himself.
“What nonsense I have talked—how abstract and remote!
And I have made you cry!
Dear girl, forgive my prosiness; marry my boy.
When I think what life is, and how seldom love is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made.” She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.
Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
“Cecil—Mr.
Beebe—the ticket’s bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair.
“I’m caught in the tangle.
I must suffer and grow old away from him.
I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
They trusted me.” A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only.
Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—” “No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—” “But why should they, when you have deceived them?” Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.” “You’re not worthy of their trust.” “What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?” “One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson.
To whom do you refer?
Trust whom?” “I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George.
They have loved one another all along.” Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman.
A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?” “Mr.
Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—” “Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!” “It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly.
“It’s the part of people that you don’t understand.” Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy!
Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr.
Beebe, could you help me?” He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am more grieved than I can possibly express.
It is lamentable, lamentable—incredible.” “What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me.
Marry George, Miss Honeychurch.
He will do admirably.” He walked out and left them.
They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair.
But his face revived her.
It was the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark.
Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know.
But remember the mountains over Florence and the view.
Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise.
George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him.
Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.” “You kiss me,” said the girl.
“You kiss me.
I will try.” He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his salutation remained.
He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he managed to strengthen her.
It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once.” Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves.
They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf.
They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity.
Trembling, anxious, cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go round the world.
The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had your father’s room.
I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.” He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.” “Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window.
It was evening and again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully.
“What can such people be made of?” “Same stuff as parsons are made of.” “Nonsense!” “Quite right.
It is nonsense.” “Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.” “Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and advancing his face to hers.
“What’s there to cry at?
Kiss me here.” He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all.
When it came to the point, it was she who remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who knew whose room this had been last year.
It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.” “Now kiss me here; then here.” Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window, opened it (as the English will), and leant out.
There was the parapet, there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills.
The cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago.
A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool.
He had helped himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its name is, still shows.” “San Miniato.
I’ll just finish your sock.” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils, the Miss Bartletts!
Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?” “Not yet.” His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?” “Silly boy!
He thinks he’s being dignified.
He knew we should go off in the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands.
They had fair warning, and now he calls it an elopement.
Ridiculous boy—” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” “But it will all come right in the end.
He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women.
He has, for the second time, quite altered.
Why will men have theories about women?
I haven’t any about men.
I wish, too, that Mr. Beebe—” “You may well wish that.” “He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us again.
I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner.
I wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run.” “Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only thing I did do—and you came back to me.
So possibly you know.” He turned back into the room.
“Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to the window, so that she, too, saw all the view.
They sank upon their knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one another’s names.
Ah!
it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—” “Oh, bother that man!” But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte.
How cruel she would be to a man like that!” “Look at the lights going over the bridge.” “But this room reminds me of Charlotte.
How horrible to grow old in Charlotte’s way!
To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house.
For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
You couldn’t have made me.
When I am very happy”—she kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs.
If Charlotte had only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to silly Greece, and become different for ever.” “But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely.
He said so.” “Oh, no, she didn’t see him.
She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church.
She said so.” George was obstinate again.
“My father,” said he, “saw her, and I prefer his word.
He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett.
A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up.
He didn’t speak to her.” Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other’s arms.
It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting.
George, who disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew.
Then, why did she risk the meeting?
She knew he was there, and yet she went to church.” They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind.
She rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?” “Mean what?” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.” “Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.” “Niente.” The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?” He whispered: “Is it this?
Is this possible?
I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped.
That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down.
That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped.
I can’t explain her any other way.
Can you?
Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable.
The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend.
There are details—it burnt.
I read the book afterwards.
She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through.
She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
We can never make friends with her or thank her.
But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.” “It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.” Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited, love attained.
But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean.
[Illustration] A Room With A View By E. M. Forster CONTENTS PART ONE Chapter I The Bertolini “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at all.
She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart.
Oh, Lucy!” “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the Signora’s unexpected accent.
“It might be London.” She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A.
Oxon.
), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London?
I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside.
I suppose it is one’s being so tired.” “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno.
The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.
The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!” “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that you shouldn’t have a view.” Lucy felt that she had been selfish.
“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of course, you must look over the Arno, too.
I meant that.
The first vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no.
You must have it.” “I insist on it.
Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.” “She would never forgive _me_.” The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a little peevish.
They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument.
He said: “I have a view, I have a view.” Miss Bartlett was startled.
Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.
She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she glanced at him.
He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes.
There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes.
These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim.
So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A view?
Oh, a view!
How delightful a view is!” “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George.
He has a view too.” “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have yours.
We’ll change.” The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.
Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.” “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.” “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy.
Her cousin again repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted.
“Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son.
“There’s nothing else to say.” He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful.
Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before.
Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change?
What possible objection had she?
They would clear out in half an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality.
It was impossible to snub any one so gross.
Her face reddened with displeasure.
She looked around as much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are genteel.” “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear.
This pension is a failure.
To-morrow we will make a change.” Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness.
Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh!
Why, it’s Mr. Beebe!
Oh, how perfectly lovely!
Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are.
Oh!” Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint: “How do you do, Mr. Beebe?
I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.” The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.
But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
“Just fancy how small the world is.
Summer Street, too, makes it so specially funny.” “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—” “Yes, I heard from mother so last week.
She didn’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr.
Beebe is—’” “Quite right,” said the clergyman.
“I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June.
I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.” “Oh, how glad I am!
The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.” “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.” “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.” He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons.
He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before.
It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field.
“Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded.
“The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.” “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table.
“Mr.
Beebe, you are wrong.
The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.” “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin.
“We are in luck.” And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them.
People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would grow upon them.
The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do.
Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them.
And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato!
They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words.
I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.” The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did.
It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more than cloth.
Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her daughter.
It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.
Was this really Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.
She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle.
“We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.
“The first evening means so much.
When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.” He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?” “Emerson.” “Is he a friend of yours?” “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.” “Then I will say no more.” He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing.
His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.” “You acted very naturally,” said he.
He seemed thoughtful, and after a few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of accepting.” “No _harm_, of course.
But we could not be under an obligation.” “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show gratitude.
He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he means.
He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them.
He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite.
It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.” Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice.” “I think he is; nice and tiresome.
I differ from him on almost every point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores.
When he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up.
He has no tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will not keep his opinions to himself.
We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.” “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?” Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?” “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet.
He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains.
Of course, he has all his father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.” “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett.
“So you think I ought to have accepted their offer?
You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?” “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.” “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?” He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared.
“Why didn’t you talk, Lucy?
He prefers young people, I’m sure.
I do hope I haven’t monopolized him.
I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time.” “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a clergyman.” “My dear Lucia—” “Well, you know what I mean.
And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.” “Funny girl!
How you do remind me of your mother.
I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe.” “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.” “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world.
I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.” “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine.
She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered.
Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.” And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more careful.
It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.” Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat.
Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room.
It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England.
Signora Bertolini is so English.” “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy.
“We dread going to bed.” “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed.
“If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful!
We were so sorry for you at dinner.” “I think he was meaning to be kind.” “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr.
Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature.
Of course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.” “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
No one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know.
No, he is not tactful; yet, have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?” “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.
“Are not beauty and delicacy the same?” “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly.
“But things are so difficult, I sometimes think.” She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms.
I’m so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again.
He has let me come and ask you.
He would be so pleased.” “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious.
I must apologize for my interference.” Gravely displeased, he turned to go.
Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours.
It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only here through your kindness.
If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it.
Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?” She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this.
I do not wish the acceptance to come from you.
Grant me that, at all events.” Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously: “Mr.
Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.” The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally.
But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out.” Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath.
All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first.
Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms!
It is all he can do to keep polite.” “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe.
Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.
“Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part.
Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature.
Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow.
Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said: “I think one might venture now.
No, Lucy, do not stir.
I will superintend the move.” “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear.
It is my affair.” “But I would like to help you.” “No, dear.” Charlotte’s energy!
And her unselfishness!
She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
So Lucy felt, or strove to feel.
And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful.
At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room.
Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.” Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him.
I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.” “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.
It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances.
It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation.
Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle.
Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson.
So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him.
Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.
It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
An electric tram came rushing underneath the window.
No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand.
Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go.
Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.
Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.
The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway.
Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.
So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone.
By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.
Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out?
Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone.
Miss Bartlett could not allow this.
Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin.
Oh, no!
that would never do.
Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person.
Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe.
Italians understand.
A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.
Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.” Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad.
The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.” Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut!
Miss Lucy!
I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He does but touch the surface of things.
As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it.
The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.” This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.
Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno.
How delightfully warm!
But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?
Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante.
San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story.
The men on the river were fishing.
(Untrue; but then, so is most information.)
Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried: “A smell!
a true Florentine smell!
Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.” “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
Buon giorno!
Buon giorno!” bowing right and left.
“Look at that adorable wine-cart!
How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!” So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.
It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno!
Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors.
_That_ is the true democracy.
Though I am a real Radical as well.
There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy.
“We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.” “I see, I see.
And now you have gone over to the enemy.” “Oh, please—!
If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right.
And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.” “Shameful!
A manufacturing district, I suppose?” “No—in the Surrey hills.
About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.” Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well.
It is full of the very nicest people.
Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?” “Very well indeed.” “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?” “Why, she rents a field of us!
How funny!” Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?” “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob.
“Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.” Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
Italy receded.
They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her.
And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed: “Bless us!
Bless us and save us!
We’ve lost the way.” Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window.
But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost!
lost!
My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.
How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do?
Two lone females in an unknown town.
Now, this is what _I_ call an adventure.” Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven!
And no, you are not, not, _not_ to look at your Baedeker.
Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it.
We will simply drift.” Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became discontented herself.
For one ravishing moment Italy appeared.
She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale.
There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven.
Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop, because it looked so typical.
It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown.
But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness.
Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically.
It was Santa Croce.
The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them.
I do detest conventional intercourse.
Nasty!
they are going into the church, too.
Oh, the Britisher abroad!” “We sat opposite them at dinner last night.
They have given us their rooms.
They were so very kind.” “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish.
“They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.
It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.” “What would you ask us?” Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she, at all events, would get full marks.
In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried: “There goes my local-colour box!
I must have a word with him!” And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes.
Then she began to get tired.
The beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places.
She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original.
But at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both gesticulating largely.
Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her Baedeker.
How could she find her way home?
How could she find her way about in Santa Croce?
Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in Florence again.
A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans.
Of course, it must be a wonderful building.
But how like a barn!
And how very cold!
Of course, it contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper.
But who was to tell her which they were?
She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
There was no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she began to be happy.
She puzzled out the Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.
She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed.
Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated.
What could this mean?
They did it again and again.
Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue.
Punishment followed quickly.
The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward.
She was too late.
He fell heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted forward also.
“Hard in life, hard in death.
Go out into the sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
Intolerable bishop!” The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and frightened!
But what else can you expect from a church?” The child’s legs had become as melting wax.
Each time that old Mr. Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar.
Fortunately an Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue.
By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
He stood.
Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson.
“You have done more than all the relics in the world.
I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy.
There is no scheme of the universe—” He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons.
She was determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply.
“But what are you doing here?
Are you doing the church?
Are you through with the church?” “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance.
“I came here with Miss Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.” “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.” “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
“I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded.
It’s worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker.
_That’s_ worth minding.” Lucy was puzzled.
She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where the idea would lead?
She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you.
I really came to help with the child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.” “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say.
You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious.
But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it.
Lucy could not get cross.
Mr. Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him.
On the other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him.
It was at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope.
It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will kindly tell me which they are.” The son nodded.
With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel.
There was a hint of the teacher about him.
She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared.
Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective.
Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true?
How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!” “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort!
Built by faith indeed!
That simply means the workmen weren’t paid properly.
And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
Look at that fat man in blue!
He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.” He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might.
The audience shifted uneasily, and so did Lucy.
She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her.
They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it?
Yes or no?” George replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all.
I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.” “You will never go up,” said his father.
“You and I, dear boy, will lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives.” “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is, going up.
It did happen like that, if it happened at all.” “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice.
“The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.” The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands.
They filed out of the chapel in silence.
Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“There’s plenty of room for us all.
Stop!” The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.” George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is.
I don’t remember.” “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
It’s that Mr.
Eager.
Why did he go?
Did we talk too loud?
How vexatious.
I shall go and say we are sorry.
Hadn’t I better?
Then perhaps he will come back.” “He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
Cuthbert Eager.
Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent.
The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her.
“He will try to be kind.” “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters.
But he is kind to people because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.” “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully—” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain.
Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness.
She saw him once again at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns.
Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only find solution in the night.
The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people.
They won’t come back.” “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy.
“Have you looked at those saints?” “Yes,” said Lucy.
“They are lovely.
Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin?” He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.
There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists.
But Mr. Emerson was only half interested.
He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily.
“I saw nothing in it.” “I like Giotto,” she replied.
“It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values.
Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
A baby is worth a dozen saints.
And my baby’s worth the whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.” Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated.
“He’s unhappy.” “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?
What more is one to give him?
And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God.
With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.” She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one.
She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked.
“He comes out for his holiday to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone.
Eh?
What did you say?” Lucy had made no suggestion.
Suddenly he said: “Now don’t be stupid over this.
I don’t require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me.
He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose?
But let yourself go.
You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night.
Let yourself go.
Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself.
It will be good for both of you.” To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.” “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.” “What things?” “The things of the universe.
It is quite true.
They don’t.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?” In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: “‘From far, from eve and morning, The stuff of life to knit me George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?
We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
But why should this make us unhappy?
Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice.
I don’t believe in this world sorrow.” Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us.
Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.” Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.
A young man melancholy because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried.
“You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then she became matronly.
“Oh, but your son wants employment.
Has he no particular hobby?
Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother.
Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.” The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it.
Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.
Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.
The dear George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd.
He approached, his face in the shadow.
He said: “Miss Bartlett.” “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective.
“Where?
Where?” “In the nave.” “I see.
Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson.
“Poor girl!” She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
“Poor girl?
I fail to understand the point of that remark.
I think myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you.
I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid time.
Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it.
Good-bye.
Thank you both so much for all your kindness.
Ah, yes!
there does come my cousin.
A delightful morning!
Santa Croce is a wonderful church.” She joined her cousin.
Chapter III Music, Violets, and the Letter “S” It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano.
She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected.
The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom.
Lucy had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.
Nor was she the passionate young lady, who performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the pictorial style.
And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory.
Victory of what and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano.
A few people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep.
She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarette-case.
Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it.
It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower.
The seats were filled with a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork.
Among the promised items was “Miss Honeychurch.
Piano.
Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III.
He was in suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends.
With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory.
He was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen.
The audience clapped, no less respectful.
It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners.
I do not consider her choice of a piece happy.
Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs.” “Introduce me.” “She will be delighted.
She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon.” “My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe.
“Why ever did she listen to it?” When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch, disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face.
She loved going to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and meringues.
He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also.
But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him: “If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting both for us and for her.” Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing!
Some one said just the same to mother, and she said she trusted I should never live a duet.” “Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?” “She doesn’t mind it.
But she doesn’t like one to get excited over anything; she thinks I am silly about it.
She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any one’s.
She has never got over it.
Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant—” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality.
She could not complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet.
The whole life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey, and the hills were dirty purple.
Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold, tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and a tickling cough in her throat.
On another day, when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray.
She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe.” “Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy.
This was a stock remark, the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition.
Miss Lavish was so original.
Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness.
For that, and for other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is writing a book?” “They do say so.” “What is it about?” “It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know.” “I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.
We started such friends.
But I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce.
Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.” “The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.” He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish.
They were always in each other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third.
Miss Lavish he believed he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning.
Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells?
All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work.
Girls like Lucy were charming to look at, but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped.
The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore.
But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse.
She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill!
And Mr. Beebe here besides.
Who would suppose this is Italy?
There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.” She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in my room with the door shut.
Doors shut; indeed, most necessary.
No one has the least idea of privacy in this country.
And one person catches it from another.” Lucy answered suitably.
Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.
The Italians are a most unpleasant people.
They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves.
We are at their mercy.
They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires.
From the cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial!
They have no conception of the intellectual life.
How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer over the children’s edjucaishion.
_Hi_ won’t ’ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’” Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way.
Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers.
Indeed, who would have supposed that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last the cause was disclosed.
From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “E.
L.” “That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman.
“A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she’d start a pipe.” “Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.
She took to it, practically in despair, after her life’s work was carried away in a landslip.
Surely that makes it more excusable.” “What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say they nearly always do.
Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink.
She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written.
The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she had an idea.
First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came here—this must on no account get round.
And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.” Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring.
She felt she had made almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.” Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade.
That old Mr. Emerson, who puts things very strangely—” Her jaw dropped.
She was silent.
Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper: “Stomach.
He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind.
I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden.
As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter.
But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought.
She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce.
Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson.
Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ Just imagine!
‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak.
I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking.
I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman!
I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place.
But that was not all.
After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.” “Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I shall go alone.’ She went.
At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.” “Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows.
No one will ever know.
Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.” “Mr.
Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice?
I do so want to know.” Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.
“No; but it is so difficult.
Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him.
Miss Alan, what do you think?
Is he nice?” The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.
Mr. Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying: “I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.” “Violets?
Oh, dear!
Who told you about the violets?
How do things get round?
A pension is a bad place for gossips.
No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce.
Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch!
It really was too bad.
No, I have quite changed.
I do _not_ like the Emersons.
They are _not_ nice.” Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly.
He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed.
He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them.
Miss Lavish, who represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans, who stood for good breeding, were following her.
Miss Bartlett, smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil.
The case of Lucy was different.
She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail.
After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now.
Even their seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once.
Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite politely, of course.” “Most right of her.
They don’t understand our ways.
They must find their level.” Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under.
They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son.
He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them.
It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle.
There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief.
“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said Lucy.
“I want to go round the town in the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say: “I wish we could.
Unluckily I have letters.
If you do want to go out alone, won’t you be better on your feet?” “Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!” But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her from the window, “and she knows it.
I put it down to too much Beethoven.” Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr. Beebe was right.
Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music.
She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan.
Conversation was tedious; she wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram.
This she might not attempt.
It was unladylike.
Why?
Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why.
It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different.
Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much.
But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.
The dragons have gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst.
She reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early Victorian song.
It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas!
the creature grows degenerate.
In her heart also there are springing up strange desires.
She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.
Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are alive.
Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
Nor has she any system of revolt.
Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she had done so.
This afternoon she was peculiarly restive.
She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved.
As she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus, being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it.
(A pity in art of course signified the nude.)
Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it.
She felt a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s “Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni Madonnas.
For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.
She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her to be conscious of it.
“The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to her.
The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it.
Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind.
It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.
An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him, and rest content.
Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.
It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky.
Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.
“Cinque lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest.
He frowned; he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all.
A crowd rose out of the dusk.
It hid this extraordinary man from her, and bore him away to the fountain.
Mr. George Emerson happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where the man had been.
How very odd!
Across something.
Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?” “Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything.
She had complained of dullness, and lo!
one man was stabbed, and another held her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade.
He must have carried her.
He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees.
She repeated: “Oh, what have I done?” “You fainted.” “I—I am very sorry.” “How are you now?” “Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home.
There’s no point in our stopping.” He held out his hand to pull her up.
She pretended not to see it.
The cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily.
The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been!
I might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well.
I can go alone, thank you.” His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?” “I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.
I must have dropped them out there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously.
“Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?” He added to his kindness.
As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!” She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.” “Yes, I am, thank you so very much.” “No, you aren’t.
You’d go openly if you were.” “But I had rather—” “Then I don’t fetch your photographs.” “I had rather be alone.” He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him.
“And don’t move till I come back.” In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in dreams.
The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day, and joined itself to earth.
How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square?
Again the thought occurred to her, “Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man, had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder.
Oddly enough, it was an easy topic.
She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before.
Being strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood.
She rose without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her, she walked firmly enough towards the Arno.
There a cabman signalled to them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police!
Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish.
When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?” He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?” “Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr.
Emerson!” “Well?” “Where are the photographs?” He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.” “I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.
Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood.
There!
I’m glad I’ve told you; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them.” He pointed down-stream.
“They’ve gone.” The river swirled under the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man.
“For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled.
It isn’t exactly that a man has died.” Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.” “Mr.
Emerson—” He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.” They were close to their pension.
She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment.
He did likewise.
There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship.
She moved her elbows before saying: “I have behaved ridiculously.” He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what came over me.” “I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.” “Oh, all right.” “And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?” “I’m afraid I don’t.” “I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?” “Your behaviour?
Oh, yes, all right—all right.” “Thank you so much.
And would you—” She could not carry her request any further.
The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
He had thrown her photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason.
It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man.
He would do her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might even have a high opinion of her.
But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe.
It was useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.
She had been in his arms, and he remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari’s shop.
It was not exactly that a man had died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents do happen, and then one returns to the old life!” “I don’t.” Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.” “But why, Mr. Emerson?
What do you mean?” “I shall want to live, I say.” Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno, whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson.
She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also.
They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.
It might have been most unpleasant.
Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone.
None of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the embankment.
Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure, not that she had encountered it.
This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action.
There were two plans between which she had to choose.
Mr. Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies.
Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?
Charlotte declined for herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.
But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth.
“It’s very kind of Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you.
I had much rather.” “Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.
How abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always!
But now she should alter.
All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the Lung’ Arno.
The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and colour.
Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it.
She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this, too!” Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did.
“Look, Lucia!
Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party.
I feared you would repent you of your choice.” Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.
Yesterday had been a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo.
Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not to re-enter it.
She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately remained.
Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria.
She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance.
For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.
She hailed them briskly.
The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett.
“After your despair of yesterday!
What a fortunate thing!” “Aha!
Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck.
Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?” “I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.” The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless creatures.
I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn’t pry.” She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few calculations in realism.
Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material.
A good deal of it was unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt.
The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note.
For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.” That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?” Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot.
But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish concluded.
“It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline.
There will be a deal of local colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall also introduce some humorous characters.
And let me give you all fair warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.” “Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett.
“I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons.” Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can.
For I repeat and I insist, and I have always held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life.” There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded.
Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett.
“That last remark struck me as so particularly true.
It should be a most pathetic novel.” Lucy assented.
At present her great aim was not to get put into it.
Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,” continued Miss Bartlett slowly.
“None but the superficial would be shocked at her.
We had a long talk yesterday.
She believes in justice and truth and human interest.
She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr.
Eager!
Why, how nice!
What a pleasant surprise!” “Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.” “We were chatting to Miss Lavish.” His brow contracted.
“So I saw.
Were you indeed?
Andate via!
sono occupato!” The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile.
“I am about to venture a suggestion.
Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a drive in the hills?
We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour’s ramble on the hillside.
The view thence of Florence is most beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape.
Decidedly.
But who looks at it to-day?
Ah, the world is too much for us.” Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that Mr.
Eager was no commonplace chaplain.
He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home.
He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent.
Tea at a Renaissance villa?
Nothing had been said about it yet.
But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same.
But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew.
A drive in the hills with Mr.
Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no longer the greatest of them.
She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain.
“In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity.
Andate via!
andate presto, presto!
Ah, the town!
Beautiful as it is, it is the town.” They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies.
To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and humiliating.” “Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened.
She can hardly bear to speak of it.” She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question.
“Do not blame her, please, Mr.
Eager.
The fault is mine: I left her unchaperoned.” “So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable.
His dark, handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.” “One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience.
I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?” Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—” “Were over at the Loggia.” “That must have saved you much.
You have not, of course, seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.” Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal league of Italy with youth.
He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr.
Eager, binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico’s angels.
She tore.
A shrill cry rose from the vendor.
The book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr.
Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a grievance.
His mysterious persecution of Mr.
Eager became relentless; the air rang with his threats and lamentations.
He appealed to Lucy; would not she intercede?
He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on bread.
He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued.
Under the chaplain’s guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy.
She had been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr.
Eager, she knew not why.
And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased to respect them.
She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist.
She doubted that Mr.
Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose.
They were tried by some new test, and they were found wanting.
As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte she was exactly the same.
It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact.
A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press.
I came across him at Brixton.” They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr.
Eager, “one has only sympathy for their success.
The desire for education and for social advance—in these things there is something not wholly vile.
There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as they would make of it.” “Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.” He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.” “Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead.
I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with me.
He was in my London parish long ago.
The other day in Santa Croce, when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him.
Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub.” “What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr.
Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended.
Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity.
Lucy, though she wished never to see the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man?
We know that already.” “Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all.
The boy—an innocent child at the time—I will exclude.
God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him.” “Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not hear.” “To speak plainly,” said Mr.
Eager, “it is.
I will say no more.” For the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the first time in her life.
“You have said very little.” “It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.
He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips.
It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily.
“That man murdered his wife!” “How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.
That day in Santa Croce—did they say anything against me?” “Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.” “Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you.
But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
“They’re nothing to me.” “How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene.
The shopman was possibly listening.
“She will find it difficult.
For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God.” The addition of God was striking.
But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
A silence followed which might have been impressive, but was merely awkward.
Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive.
“Drive?
Oh, is our drive to come off?” Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr.
Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed.
“It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all.
Why should he invite us in that absurd manner?
We might as well invite him.
We are each paying for ourselves.” Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish.” “How?” “Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.” “That will mean another carriage.” “Far worse.
Mr.
Eager does not like Eleanor.
She knows it herself.
The truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.” They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank.
Lucy stood by the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer, or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain.
The well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets?
Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it.
Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck.
She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank.
As she groped she murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr.
Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we must be prepared.
It is you they really want; I am only asked for appearances.
You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will follow behind.
A one-horse carriage would do for us.
Yet how difficult it is!” “It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.” “Oh, dear, Lucy!
I do hope Florence isn’t boring you.
Speak the word, and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.” “Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her mother’s letters could be.
She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway.
She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs.
Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news that interested her least.
“Do you know the Vyses?” “Oh, not that way back.
We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria.” “They’re nice people, the Vyses.
So clever—my idea of what’s really clever.
Don’t you long to be in Rome?” “I die for it!” The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant.
It has no grass, no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick.
By an odd chance—unless we believe in a presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity.
Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before.
Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly.
“Here’s an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel?
For I do know what I want.
I’m sick of Florence.
No, you said you’d go to the ends of the earth!
Do!
Do!” Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied: “Oh, you droll person!
Pray, what would become of your drive in the hills?” They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up the stony hill.
Mr. Beebe recognized him at once.
Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.
And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light.
To her Mr.
Eager objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition.
But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
She did not mind.
Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy.
The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss Lavish.
For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting Mr.
Eager, had doubled the size of the party.
And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus transformed.
Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.
But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr.
Eager, repressive towards Miss Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring.
She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate.
But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully.
In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy.
She had refused, not because she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he did know.
And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia, but by the river.
To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled emotion, but of the whole fabric.
There was really something blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word.
This sense of wickedness had been slight at first.
She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo.
But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again.
And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr.
Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling?
As a student of art?” “Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!” “Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like myself?” “Oh, no.
I am here as a tourist.” “Oh, indeed,” said Mr.
Eager.
“Are you indeed?
If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.
The result is, they mix up towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl.
You know the American girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’ There’s travelling for you.
Ha!
ha!
ha!” “I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit.
“The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.” “Quite so.
Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are here for trade, for example.
But the greater part are students.
Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico.
I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left.
No, you can only see it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall.
She is very proud of that thick hedge.
Inside, perfect seclusion.
One might have gone back six hundred years.
Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?” “It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish.
“Tell me, where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day?” But Mr.
Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr.
Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill.
“Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’?
He is working at Gemistus Pletho.
Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.” During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully.
Lucy had a spasm of envy.
Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.
They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road.
“Piano!
piano!” said Mr.
Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped his horses up again.
Now Mr.
Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or was he one of its manifestations?
The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.
“Piano!
piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.
Phaethon, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was most unpleasant.
The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr.
Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but at its manner.
At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and patted them on the back to signify his approval.
And Miss Lavish, though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried.
“But I dare say I shall receive scant support.
I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life.
This is what _I_ call an adventure.” “We must not submit,” said Mr.
Eager.
“I knew he was trying it on.
He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.” “Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood in no awe.
“Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there?
To be driven by lovers—A king might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I know.” Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect.
Mr.
Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will, was determined to make himself heard.
He addressed the driver again.
Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream, with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker, and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased.
Why should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto.
She pointed at the other carriage.
Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other.
Then Persephone got down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr.
Eager, smiting his hands together as the carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson.
“It is defeat.
You have parted two people who were happy.” Mr.
Eager shut his eyes.
He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but he would not speak to him.
The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took up the matter warmly.
He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money.
He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.
We have no rights over his soul.” Miss Lavish frowned.
It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said.
“He jolted us.” “That I deny.
It was as restful as sleeping.
Aha!
he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder?
He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is justified.
And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl, too.
It doesn’t do to injure young people.
Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici?” Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have.
Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature?” “The Lord knows.
Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go fighting against the Spring.’” Mr.
Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured.
“‘War not with the May’ would render a correct meaning.” “The point is, we have warred with it.
Look.” He pointed to the Val d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them.
Do you suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man?
But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.” No one encouraged him to talk.
Presently Mr.
Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain.
It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before.
He had ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending.
Standing there, he had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work.
But where exactly had he stood?
That was the question which Mr.
Eager hoped to solve now.
And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups.
Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask.
In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio Baldovinetti, but the drive.
Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was very sorry that she had asked him.
She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him.
Mr. Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish.
“Oh, but I shall die!
Of course it was the railway!” She could not control her mirth.
“He is the image of a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.” “Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion.
“Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—” “I can’t stop.
Let me go my wicked way.
A porter—” “Eleanor!” “I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy.
“The Emersons won’t hear, and they wouldn’t mind if they did.” Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly.
“Pouf!
Wouf!
You naughty girl!
Go away!” “Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr.
Eager, I’m sure.” “I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.” “Mr.
Eager will be offended.
It is your party.” “Please, I’d rather stop here with you.” “No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish.
“It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.
Miss Lucy, you are to go.
We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.” The girl was stubborn.
As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.
Such a one was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte.
She wished she had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Oh, I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here.” Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm.
Lucy did not look at the view either.
She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish.
“Observe my foresight.” With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy.
The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
If I do feel it coming on I shall stand.
Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist.
“Here we are, all settled delightfully.
Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown.
Sit down, dear; you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared her throat.
“Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold.
It’s the tiniest cough, and I have had it three days.
It’s nothing to do with sitting here at all.” There was only one way of treating the situation.
At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr.
Eager, vanquished by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.
The miscreant, a bony young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up.
Of course he knew where.
Not so far either.
His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon.
He should just think he did know where.
He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary.
What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good?
Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings!
He showed her his cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?” She was correct as usual.
He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her.
Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.
Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
She thanked him with real pleasure.
In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
For the first time she felt the influence of Spring.
His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?” “Ma buoni uomini.” He bowed.
Certainly.
Good men first, violets afterwards.
They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker.
They were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces.
He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant boughs.
She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.
Not a step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?” There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.
The voice of Mr.
Eager?
He shrugged his shoulders.
An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge.
She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen.
The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
Light and beauty enveloped her.
She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.” She did not answer.
From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view, and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam.
But never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival.
For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.
He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves.
The bushes above them closed.
He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called, “Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.
What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was slow to discover.
Mr.
Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk.
Mr. Emerson, seeking his son, was told whereabouts to find him.
Mr. Beebe, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the return home.
There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment.
Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics.
Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise.
Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett.
Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager.
Mr. Emerson had lost George.
Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square.
Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable.
He climbed on to the box shivering, with his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather.
“Let us go immediately,” he told them.
“The signorino will walk.” “All the way?
He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently.
I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.
He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence.
He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.
He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also.
Not so these English.
They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents, but infinitely the least dangerous.
Once back in the town, he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more.
Of course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it.
But after all, what have we to do with taverns?
Real menace belongs to the drawing-room.
It was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun.
Lucy sat beside her; Mr.
Eager sat opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious.
They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together.
The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol.
There was a lightning flash, and Miss Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front.
At the next flash, Lucy screamed also.
Mr.
Eager addressed her professionally: “Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith.
If I might say so, there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements.
Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?” “No—of course—” “Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous.
The steel knives, the only articles which might attract the current, are in the other carriage.
And, in any case, we are infinitely safer than if we were walking.
Courage—courage and faith.” Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand.
At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles, gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr.
Eager!” called Mr. Beebe.
“We want your assistance.
Will you interpret for us?” “George!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way.
He may be killed.” “Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver is no help.
Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.” “He may be killed!” cried the old man.
“He may be killed!” “Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage.
“In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.” “What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr.
Eager know?” “Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing.
But—” she pointed at the driver—“_he_ knows everything.
Dearest, had we better?
Shall I?” She took out her purse.
“It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book, she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it.
As well this ending to his day as any.
But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road.
The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen.
If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt.
They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.
They descended from the carriages; they embraced each other.
It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them.
For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly.
In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike.
Miss Lavish calculated that, even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the accident.
Mr.
Eager mumbled a temperate prayer.
But the drivers, through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me.
Kiss me again.
Only you can understand me.
You warned me to be careful.
And I—I thought I was developing.” “Do not cry, dearest.
Take your time.” “I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse.
Once by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?” The thought disturbed her repentance.
As a matter of fact, the storm was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not.
One would always pray against that.” “He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that.
I simply slipped into those violets.
No, I want to be really truthful.
I am a little to blame.
I had silly thoughts.
The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.” “In a book?” “Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.” “And then?” “But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
Indeed, she had little more to learn.
With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her.
All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
“It is so hard to be absolutely truthful.” “Don’t be troubled, dearest.
Wait till you are calmer.
We will talk it over before bed-time in my room.” So they re-entered the city with hands clasped.
It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others.
The storm had ceased, and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son.
Mr. Beebe had regained good humour, and Mr.
Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish.
Charlotte alone she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening.
She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it.
All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be carefully laid before her cousin.
And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself.
I shan’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know what.” Miss Alan asked her to play.
She refused vehemently.
Music seemed to her the employment of a child.
She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own.
Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay.
In vain she tried to check, or at all events to accelerate, the tale.
It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach: “Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire.
Come into my room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.” With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the girl.
Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?” She was unprepared for the question.
It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything.
A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done?
A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.” The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door.
A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes.
She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?” “The driver?” “My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.” Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?” “I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.” “I, too, intend to judge him charitably.
But unfortunately I have met the type before.
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first?
Come here and listen to me.
I am only gathering it from his own remarks.
Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another?” “Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude.
There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish.
But we are no farther on with our question.
What do you propose to do?” An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it.
But—as you said—it is my affair.
Mine and his.” “And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?” “Certainly not.
There would be no difficulty.
Whatever you ask him he answers, yes or no; then it is over.
I have been frightened of him.
But now I am not one little bit.” “But we fear him for you, dear.
You are so young and inexperienced, you have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round.
This afternoon, for example, if I had not arrived, what would have happened?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?” “I hadn’t time to think.
You came.” “Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?” “I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off.
She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett.
“You will be seen from the road.” Lucy obeyed.
She was in her cousin’s power.
She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started.
Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man!
We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless.
There is Mr.
Eager, but you do not trust him.
Oh, for your brother!
He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.
Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead.
There are still left some men who can reverence woman.” As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and ranged them upon the pin cushion.
Then she blew into her gloves and said: “It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.” “What train?” “The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?” “At eight.” “Signora Bertolini would be upset.” “We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.” “I expect she will.
However, we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses’ hotel.
Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?” “Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained motionless and silent.
To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome.
Lucy, when admonished, began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte, who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly.
She knelt down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.
But she was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her, but needed her to love.
For it was in ominous tones that she said, after a long pause: “Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?” Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant.
Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: “Charlotte dear, what do you mean?
As if I have anything to forgive!” “You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
I know well how much I vex you at every turn.” “But no—” Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged martyr.
“Ah, but yes!
I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped.
I might have known it would not do.
You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you.
I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.” “Please—” “My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and were often able to leave me at home.
I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary.
You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.” “You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other, heart and soul.
They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own.
“Failed to make you happy; failed in my duty to your mother.
She has been so generous to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.” “But mother will understand.
It is not your fault, this trouble, and it isn’t a disaster either.” “It is my fault, it is a disaster.
She will never forgive me, and rightly.
For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish?” “Every right.” “When I was here for your sake?
If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you.
Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.” Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence.
There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.” The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her.
But in case she should blame you in any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to.
I will never speak of it either to her or to any one.” Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.
Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background.
George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually.
At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since, it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent.
She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed, for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love.
Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters.
Before she reached them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle.
Thus it was that, though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers.
She was still dressed.
It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved.
At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said: “I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.” Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr. Emerson.” His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true.
It can’t all be true.
I want not to be muddled.
I want to grow older quickly.” Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear.
You need all the rest you can get.” In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun.
They were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied.
A poet—none was present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room.
One—a boy of nineteen—was studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano.
From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him what she had written.
And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother.
“I tell you I’m getting fairly sick.” “For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
“Time they did.” “I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.” “It’s his third go, isn’t it?” “Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.” “I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy.
I don’t know how girls manage things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.” “Do you indeed, dear?
How interesting!” “I feel—never mind.” He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse.
I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’” “Yes, mother, you told me.
A jolly good letter.” “I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.
But—’” She stopped reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all.
He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth.
When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.” “Nor me.” “You?” Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?” “He asked me for my permission also.” She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir.
“Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?
What ever did you say?” “I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’” “What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come.
There they still are!” “I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.” “Peeping like that!
Can’t I look out of my own window?” But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves.
For a brief space they were silent.
Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave a nervous gulp.
“Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy.
He practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her?
And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.” “I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.” “I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth.
“There!
Fly into a stew!
I can’t help it—had to say it.
I had to say no.
He ought never to have asked me.” “Ridiculous child!” cried his mother.
“You think you’re so holy and truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit.
Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say?
I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?” “Oh, do keep quiet, mother!
I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.
I tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right.
But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.” “No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the subject, “I shall not keep quiet.
You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.” “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
“I only let out I didn’t like him.
I don’t hate him, but I don’t like him.
What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.” He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“I know his mother; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick the piano!
He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained dissatisfied.
She added: “And he has beautiful manners.” “I liked him till just now.
I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.” “Mr.
Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest.
“I don’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in.” “You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means.
He said: ‘Mr.
Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he meant.
He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking.
Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.” “You never can, dear.
But I can.
You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.” The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it.
But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust.
Cecil praised one too much for being athletic.
Was that it?
Cecil made one talk in one’s own way.
This tired one.
Was that it?
And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow’s cap.
Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself.
He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother.
“‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light.
She keeps that flat abominably—” “Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?” “Don’t interrupt so foolishly.
Where was I?
Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing.
I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything.
But I do not know—’” “Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation.
He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles.
Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds.
But it was transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald.
Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described.
He was medieval.
Like a Gothic statue.
Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism.
A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant.
And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!” “I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals.
They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.
We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the furniture.
“This is indeed a joyous day!
I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy.” “I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat.
She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis.
Then she saw her brother’s face.
Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?” Cecil suggested.
“And I’d stop here and tell my mother.” “We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.” They passed into the sunlight.
Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and descend out of sight by the steps.
They would descend—he knew their ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed, until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical.
He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s.
That day she had seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel.
But Italy worked some marvel in her.
It gave her light, and—which he held more precious—it gave her shadow.
Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence.
She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness.
Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other.
It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the same to him as before.
Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language.
She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her.
He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
The things that really mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy.
His mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he moved to the writing table.
There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many erasures.
He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.
With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table.
The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter.
He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about it none the less.
It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected.
“I represent all that he despises.
Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?” The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
“Mr.
Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse.
Do you suppose that I shall get it?” “I should say so.
Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.” “Pfui!” “I know,” said Cecil.
“I know.
I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.” For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip.
Isn’t this news?” “News?
I don’t understand you,” said Cecil.
“News?” Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field.
He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!” “Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself.
Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen!
Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
But his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question!
To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church!
I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.” “I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly.
“I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board.
Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the right names.
I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery.
It is very remiss of me.
Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.” Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?” “I have no profession,” said Cecil.
“It is another example of my decadence.
My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
I know I ought to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.” “You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe.
“It is a wonderful opportunity, the possession of leisure.” His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally.
He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve.
I daren’t face the healthy person—for example, Freddy Honeychurch.” “Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?” “Admirable.
The sort who has made England what she is.” Cecil wondered at himself.
Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly contrary?
He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea before evening service.” “I suppose Anne never told them you were here.
In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives.
The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?” “I know the faults of Mary.
She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.” “The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small.” They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many.
No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.” “She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree.
At present she has none.” “At present?” “I’m not cynical.
I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle.
Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.” Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?” “Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps.
Oh, I forgot; of course, you knew her before.
No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.” “In what way?” Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string.
Picture number two: the string breaks.” The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically.
At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?” “No.
I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.” “It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst.
He cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken?
What do you mean?” “I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.” The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize.
I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners.
Was this the reception his action would get from the world?
Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly.
“I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.” “Not that.
But you ought to have stopped me.
I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes.
Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with any one; certainly not with you.” “You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?” Mr. Beebe pulled himself together.
Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions.
He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet.
I foresaw at Florence that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended.
I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio.
He did not omit to do so.
“She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her.” “Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?” Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march.
Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried.
He looked at Lucy.
In her presence he could not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.
I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great and small.
I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and mother.
And now I want my tea.” “You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted.
“How dare you be serious at Windy Corner?” He took his tone from her.
There was no more heavy beneficence, no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures.
None of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe.
Away from it, in the solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical.
But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious.
It has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart.
The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed.
Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel sentimental.
Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.
If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true.
Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them greatly.
They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door.
Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance.
Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as a mother-in-law.
As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him.
People congratulated Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid.
They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with the dowagers.
When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?” “I suppose so.
Mother, would it be?” “Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and said: “To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.” “I am so sorry that you were stranded.” “Not that, but the congratulations.
It is so disgusting, the way an engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment.
All those old women smirking!” “One has to go through it, I suppose.
They won’t notice us so much next time.” “But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong.
An engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and should be treated as such.” Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially correct.
The spirit of the generations had smiled through them, rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth.
To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite different—personal love.
Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said.
“Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?” “I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public.
The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic.
Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato.” “Inglese Italianato?” “E un diavolo incarnato!
You know the proverb?” She did not.
Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother.
But Cecil, since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.” “We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?” “It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in, or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?” She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert.
“I don’t see any difference.
Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same place.” “We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap.
“This is me.
That’s Windy Corner.
The rest of the pattern is the other people.
Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.” She leant placidly back.
Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and that’s Mr. Beebe.” “A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.” Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect what they meant.
She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried.
“I consider him far above the average.
I only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful ones, is Mr.
Eager, the English chaplain at Florence.
He was truly insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate.
He was a snob, and so conceited, and he did say such unkind things.” “What sort of things?” “There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife.” “Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing.
Mr.
Eager would never come to the point.
He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.” “Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander?
It was, I believe, chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped.
People pretended he was vulgar, but he certainly wasn’t that.” “Poor old man!
What was his name?” “Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr.
Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know.
I hate him.
I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto.
I hate him.
Nothing can hide a petty nature.
I _hate_ him.” “My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“You’ll blow my head off!
Whatever is there to shout over?
I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen.” He smiled.
There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s moral outburst over Mr.
Eager.
It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine.
He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not in muscular rant.
But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive.
After a moment, he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval.
He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.
He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.
The outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact.
Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I feel I could never live out of it.
When I’m in the country I feel the same about the country.
After all, I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who live amongst them must be the best.
It’s true that in nine cases out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything.
The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions.
Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town.
Do you feel that, Mrs. Honeychurch?” Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled.
She had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either.
Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics.
It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?” “‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?” “Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled spire.
Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church.
In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages.
Some great mansions were at hand, but they were hidden in the trees.
The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement, having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals.
“Albert” was inhabited.
His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace.
“Cissie” was to let.
Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically.
“Summer Street will never be the same again.” As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry.
Now we shall know.
Sir Harry, pull those things down at once!” Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I meant to.
I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss Flack.” “Am I not always right?
She ought to have gone before the contract was signed.
Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s time?” “But what can I do?” He lowered his voice.
“An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden.” “Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully.
He had had full warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory.
He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt.
Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper.
He ventured to differ, however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration.
Sir Harry hinted that a column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin.
He built his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage.
He had failed in his duties to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy landlord.
But it is such an awkward size.
It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.” Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them.
The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously.
“It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.” “Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly.
“That is exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong type of people.
The train service has improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind.
And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?” “Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate.
She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea.
How would you like spinsters?” “My dear Lucy, it would be splendid.
Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.
I heard from them last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.
I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people.
Mr. Beebe knows them, too.
May I tell them to write to you?” “Indeed you may!” he cried.
“Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
How delightful it is!
Extra facilities—please tell them they shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees.
Oh, the agents!
The appalling people they have sent me!
One woman, when I wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance.
As if one cares about that!
And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable.
And oh, the deceit!
I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week.
The deceit of the most promising people.
My dear Lucy, the deceit!” She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all.
I know the type.
Preserve me from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy.
It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down.” “I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very sad thing.” “The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil.
“I haven’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.” “Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.” “It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied.
“I oughtn’t to come with my troubles to young people.
But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no real help.” “Then may I write to my Misses Alan?” “Please!” But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed: “Beware!
They are certain to have canaries.
Sir Harry, beware of canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come.
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.” “Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
If they get drunk, there’s an end of them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off.
If they’re vulgar, they somehow keep it to themselves.
It doesn’t spread so.
Give me a man—of course, provided he’s clean.” Sir Harry blushed.
Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex.
Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction.
He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself.
She was delighted.
Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house.
Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?” “Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.
He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha!
young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!” “I can’t help it.
It would be wrong not to loathe that man.” “He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.” “No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life.
In London he would keep his place.
He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife would give brainless dinner parties.
But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and every one—even your mother—is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt discouraged.
“I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.” “It matters supremely.
Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!
How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
with his bald head and retreating chin!
But let’s forget him.” This Lucy was glad enough to do.
If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape?
For instance, Freddy.
Freddy was neither clever, nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”?
And what would she reply?
Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety enough.
She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps, during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them.
Summer Street lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
“Why is it, Lucy, that you always say the road?
Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?” “Haven’t I?
The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with me in a room.” “A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes.
Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road.
Never in the real country like this.” “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
I have never felt anything of the sort.
You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.” “I don’t know that you aren’t.
I connect you with a view—a certain type of view.
Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?” She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing: “Do you know that you’re right?
I do.
I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room.
How funny!” To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray?
With no view?” “Yes, with no view, I fancy.
Why not?” “I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open air.” She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?” As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees.
She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!” “Why do you call it that?” “I can’t remember why.
I suppose it comes out of some book.
It’s only a puddle now, but you see that stream going through it?
Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful.
Then Freddy used to bathe there.
He is very fond of it.” “And you?” He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed here, too, till I was found out.
Then there was a row.” At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of prudishness within him.
But now?
with his momentary cult of the fresh air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity.
He looked at her as she stood by the pool’s edge.
She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?” “Charlotte,” she murmured.
“She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.” “Poor girl!” She smiled gravely.
A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
“What, Cecil?” “Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me—” He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed.
His courage had gone.
“Yes?” “Up to now I have never kissed you.” She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?” “Of course, you may, Cecil.
You might before.
I can’t run at you, you know.” At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities.
Her reply was inadequate.
She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil.
As he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them.
Such was the embrace.
He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure.
Passion should believe itself irresistible.
It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young man behind the counter would have done?
He recast the scene.
Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness.
For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation.
He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts.
At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.” “What name?” “The old man’s.” “What old man?” “That old man I told you about.
The one Mr.
Eager was so unkind to.” He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had.
Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to.
Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself.
Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs.
Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy.
He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility.
“I cannot think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter.
When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.
The best obtainable.
Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles.
A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia.
Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes.
In this circle, one thought, married, and died.
Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills.
But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high.
You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you.
She returned with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation.
He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad.
He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
Nor did he realize a more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her.
A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved.
For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.” “But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe.
“I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably.
They are coming.
I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried.
“Just because they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing.
And poor Lucy—serve her right—worn to a shadow.” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court.
Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn.
When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring.
“If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count.
I told you not Saturn.” “Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.” “Saturn doesn’t bounce.” “Saturn bounces enough.” “No, he doesn’t.” “Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.” “Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in.
That’s right, Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over the shins!” Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness.
Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt.
He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
But he hated the physical violence of the young.
How right it was!
Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.” “That wasn’t the name—” Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.” “Nonsense, Freddy!
You know nothing about it.” “Nonsense yourself!
I’ve this minute seen him.
He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem!
ahem!
I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’ and slapped him on the back.” “Exactly.
The Miss Alans?” “Rather not.
More like Anderson.” “Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed.
“Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right?
I _said_ don’t interfere with Cissie Villa.
I’m always right.
I’m quite uneasy at being always right so often.” “It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s.
Freddy doesn’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.” “Yes, I do.
I’ve got it.
Emerson.” “What name?” “Emerson.
I’ll bet you anything you like.” “What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly.
“I wish I had never bothered over it at all.” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky.
Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy?
Do you know what Emersons they are?” “I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was democratic.
Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person.
All right, Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother’s a snob.
But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s affectation to pretend there isn’t.” “Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways.
Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man.
Pray, does that satisfy you?” “Oh, yes,” he grumbled.
“And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety.” “_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly.
“Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.” “But has Cecil—” “Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’” She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much.
While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl.
She might well “screech” when she heard that it came partly from her lover.
Mr. Vyse was a tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people.
The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
He diverted it as follows: “The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean?
No, I don’t suppose it will prove to be them.
It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse’s.
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people!
The queerest people!
For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets.
They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa.
Poor little ladies!
So shocked and so pleased.
It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories.
‘My dear sister loves flowers,’ it began.
They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult.
Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets.” “Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister’s face was very red.
She could not recover herself.
Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature—pessimism, et cetera.
Our special joy was the father—such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.
He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Lucy, don’t desert us—go on playing bumble-puppy.
Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place.
That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being there.
Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop?
By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time.” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer.
He suggested that his hostess was mistaken.
At the hint of opposition she warmed.
She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told.
The name escaped her.
What was the name?
Oh, what was the name?
She clasped her knees for the name.
Something in Thackeray.
She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely.
“Don’t be silly.
You always overdo it when you play.” As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
Hitherto truth had come to her naturally.
She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely truthful?
Well, at all events, she must not tell lies.
She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame.
A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.
“Cecil!” “Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window.
He seemed in high spirits.
“I was hoping you’d come.
I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse.
George Meredith’s right—the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa.
Don’t be angry!
Don’t be angry!
You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.” He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said.
“Freddy has told us.
Naughty Cecil!
I suppose I must forgive you.
Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have nice friends of yours.
But you oughtn’t to tease one so.” “Friends of mine?” he laughed.
“But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was.
“Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week.” “What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously.
“I don’t quite understand.” “In the Umbrian Room.
Absolute strangers.
They were admiring Luca Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly.
However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not a little.
They had been to Italy.” “But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends.
I thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—” “Cecil!
No, it’s not fair.
I’ve probably met them before—” He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair.
Anything is fair that punishes a snob.
That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good.
Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with me.
There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things.
I believe in democracy—” “No, you don’t,” she snapped.
“You don’t know what the word means.” He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque.
“No, you don’t!” Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil.
I blame you—I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous.
You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense?
I consider it most disloyal of you.” She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness.
As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded.
He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally.
He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent.
In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse.
His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch.
Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement, met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned.
The Miss Alans were duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held responsible for the failure.
Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived.
Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood.
And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood.
Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood.
But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done.
She was glad that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative.
He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy.
At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do!
I don’t know what I should do without you.” Several days passed.
Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett.
A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not corresponded since they parted in August.
The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased amazingly.
For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical.
Charlotte, unselfish in the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue their tour.
Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs.
Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly.
Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS, “_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA, “I have news of you at last!
Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome.
Puncturing her tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out.
He said his father had just taken the house.
He _said_ he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (?).
He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea.
Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him to enter the house, etc.
That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you have told them already.
Mr. Vyse is so sensitive.
I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome.
I am very sorry about it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me, “Your anxious and loving cousin, “CHARLOTTE.” Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows: “BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE, “Many thanks for your warning.
When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she would blame you for not being always with me.
I have kept that promise, and cannot possibly tell her now.
I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself.
She should have tried at the Rectory.
I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage.
You must see that it would be too absurd.
If the Emersons heard I had complained of them, they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they are not.
I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy Corner at all, but here.
Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your envelope again.
No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately, “L.
M. HONEYCHURCH.” Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not.
Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at?
Miss Bartlett suggested the former.
Perhaps she was right.
It had become a great thing now.
Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago.
She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school.
But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.
It did her no harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors.
The weather was cool, and it did her no harm.
In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people.
The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.
One was tired of everything, it seemed.
One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter.
In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann.
“Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the querulous beauty of the music had died.
She shook her head and played Schumann again.
The melody rose, unprofitably magical.
It broke; it was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave.
The sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of the audience throb.
Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s, had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among many people.
The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.” “Her music always was wonderful.” “Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean.
She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.” “Italy has done it.” “Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her.
“It is just possible.
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.” “But her music!” he exclaimed.
“The style of her!
How she kept to Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schumann was right for this evening.
Schumann was the thing.
Do you know, mother, I shall have our children educated just like Lucy.
Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then—not till then—let them come to London.
I don’t believe in these London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.” “Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s room.
Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself.
She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.” “Bad dreams?” “Just dreams.” The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You should have heard us talking about you, dear.
He admires you more than ever.
Dream of that.” Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed.
Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed.
As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.” “M’m.” “They might amuse you.” Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe.
“They are worth it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
“Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!” “I’ve brought someone to see you.” “I’ll be down in a minute.” The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered.
“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment.
What have they got?
Byron.
Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad.
Never heard of it.
The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it.
Gibbon.
Hullo!
dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.” “Mr.
Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.” “I know.
Isn’t it jolly?
I like that.
I’m certain that’s the old man’s doing.” “How very odd of him!” “Surely you agree?” But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.” “The same as Lucy’s got.” “Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?” “She came back yesterday.” “I suppose she had a good time?” “Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book.
“She and Cecil are thicker than ever.” “That’s good hearing.” “I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.” Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks.
She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books.
Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
Cecil says—” “What on earth are those people doing upstairs?
Emerson—we think we’ll come another time.” George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.” Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face wanted washing.
At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe.” “Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do?
how d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard.
But I’m afraid it will only act between men.
Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How do you do?
Come and have a bathe’?
And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.” “I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.
I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.” “We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you place in the past, is really yet to come.
We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.” Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead.
We despise the body less than women do.
But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.” “I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once.
But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
It is our heritage.” “Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.” “How do you do?
Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty.
I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He has been most kind.
He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
Ah, this wind!
You do well to bathe.
Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!” “Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy.
“I must—that is to say, I have to—have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.” “_Call_, my lad?
Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
Call on your grandmother!
Listen to the wind among the pines!
Yours is a glorious country.” Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr.
Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval.
It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, George.
Why do you dawdle talking?
Bring them back to tea.
Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his office.
I can’t believe he’s well.” George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him.
“It is only a pond, don’t you know.
I dare say you are used to something better.” “Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.” Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
How glorious it was!
For a little time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
He spoke of Florence.
George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse!
Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?” “I did not.
Miss Lavish told me.” “When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of Coincidence.’” No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.” To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is.
I have reflected.
It is Fate.
Everything is Fate.
We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart.
The twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—” “You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman.
“Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
Don’t say, ‘I didn’t do this,’ for you did it, ten to one.
Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?” “Italy.” “And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?” “National Gallery.” “Looking at Italian art.
There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.” “It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George.
“But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.” Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is still to write.” Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that you have come.” Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond.
I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe.
“No apologies are necessary for the pond.” George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid?
I love willow-herb in seed.
What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
Very charming, very charming.” “Mr.
Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George.
Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
It was necessary to use his muscles.
It was necessary to keep clean.
Mr. Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful, water’s simply ripping.” “Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful.
Mr. Beebe, do.” “Apooshoo, kouf.” Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
How glorious it was!
The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Götterdämmerung.
But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
They began to play.
Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
A little deferentially, they splashed George.
He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: “No.
We are what matters.
Without us shall no enterprise begin.
To us shall all flesh turn in the end.” “A try!
A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a kick.
“Goal!” “Goal!” “Pass!” “Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat!
No, that’s enough, Freddy.
Dress now.
No, I say!” But the two young men were delirious.
Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
“Hi!
Steady on!
I see people coming you fellows!” Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi!
hi!
_Ladies!_” Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
Still, they did not hear Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Whoever were those unfortunate people?
Oh, dears, look away!
And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?” “Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
Cecil, Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—” No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently “minded.” “I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.” “This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.” They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
“I can’t be trodden on, can I?” “Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you!
What miserable management!
Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?” “Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and if another fellow—” “Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
Come, Lucy.” They turned.
“Oh, look—don’t look!
Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
How unfortunate again—” For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken.
“I’ve swallowed a pollywog.
It wriggleth in my tummy.
I shall die—Emerson you beast, you’ve got on my bags.” “Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
“And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.” “Mother, do come away,” said Lucy.
“Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.” “Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed.
Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called: “Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
Hullo!” “Bow, Lucy; better bow.
Whoever is it?
I shall bow.” Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away.
On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for youth.
Chapter XIII How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview!
But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume.
Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent.
She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life.
A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much.
“I will bow,” she had thought.
“I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom?
To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.
It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.
Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and he did not want to be seen.
He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside.
He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done.
Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock.
Miss Bartlett, indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory.
Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with Cecil?” The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.” “Perhaps he’s tired.” Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.” “I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.” “Cecil has told you to think so.
You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.” “Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?” “Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?” “Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble ahead.
“It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him sometimes seem—” “Oh, rubbish!
If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother!
I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!” “Not in that way.
At times I could wring her neck.
But not in that way.
No.
It is the same with Cecil all over.” “By-the-by—I never told you.
I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London.” This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me.
No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.” “I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to.
But he does not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.” “Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?” “You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.” “Then why didn’t he leave the room?
Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone’s pleasure?” “We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy.
Something had enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form.
The two civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes.
Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he had succeeded.
And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother—” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
Go.” She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window.
It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.
Now, as in the winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes.
One connected the landing window with depression.
No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly.
And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.
She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.” “My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been!
You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public.
It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else.
Do be more careful.
You forget the place is growing half suburban.” “I say, is anything on to-morrow week?” “Not that I know of.” “Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.” “Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.” “What’s wrong with the court?
They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered new balls.” “I meant _it’s_ better not.
I really mean it.” He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper.
Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans.
Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making!
I have something to say to you.
Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes.
I really can’t stop.
I must dress too.” “How’s Charlotte?” “All right.” “Lucy!” The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?” “Her _what?_” “Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?” “I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly.
“I shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.” Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out.
She did not.
She said: “Come here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life.
It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil.
Cecil despised their methods—perhaps rightly.
At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven.
Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
Then Freddy said: “Lucy, what’s Emerson like?” “I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?” “Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.” “He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly.
I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.” “Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter.” “One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie.
“Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.” “Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.” “She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily.
The remark was a happy one, for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print.
Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath.
But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness.
There were too many ghosts about.
The original ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr.
Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes.
It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s.
How is she?” “I tore the thing up.” “Didn’t she say how she was?
How does she sound?
Cheerful?” “Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.” “Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler.
I know myself how water preys upon one’s mind.
I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the meat.” Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish.
I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long.” It was more than her nerves could stand.
And she could not protest violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded.
“It’s impossible.
We can’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is.
Freddy’s got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare.
It simply can’t be done.” “Nonsense!
It can.” “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
Not otherwise.” “Minnie can sleep with you.” “I won’t have her.” “Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.” “Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy.
“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.” “No, I don’t.
And no more does Cecil.
She gets on our nerves.
You haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good.
So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come.” “Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two.
You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers.
You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.” Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike,” put in Freddy.
“She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.” “I know, dear.
She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return.” But Lucy hardened her heart.
It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She had tried herself too often and too recently.
One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth.
She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother.
I don’t like Charlotte.
I admit it’s horrid of me.” “From your own account, you told her as much.” “Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
She flurried—” The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the places she had known as a child.
The Sacred Lake would never be the same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner.
How would she fight against ghosts?
For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care for eggs.
I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.” Cecil frowned again.
Oh, these Honeychurches!
Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact.
“May me and Lucy get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.” Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room—something with no view, anything.
Her love to Lucy.
And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
She never gazed inwards.
If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
She was nervous at night.
When she talked to George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
Once she had suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious.
Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
She loved Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
Standing between Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his crudities in time.
I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.” Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits.
He laughs more.” “Yes,” replied the clergyman.
“He is waking up.” That was all.
But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs. Honeychurch drove to meet her.
She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“I have upset everything.
Bursting in on young people!
But I insist on paying for my cab up.
Grant that, at any rate.” “Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.” “I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather.
Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.” Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
Only sovereigns and pennies.
Could any one give her change?
Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But who am I to give the sovereign to?” “Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.” Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid.
A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
I should practically be robbing the one who lost.” “Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil.
“So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.” “Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
“How is that, Mr. Vyse?” “Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab.
Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.” Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy.
He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
“I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid.” “Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.” “But I don’t see—” They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you.
I’m done.
I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me.
Ow!
What about Mr. Floyd’s ten shillings?
Ow!
No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.” “I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
“Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
A shilling was it?
Can any one give me change for half a crown?” “I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign.
No, give me up that sovereign.
I’ll get Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning.” “Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?” “No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
“Let me see—a sovereign’s worth of silver.” She escaped into the kitchen.
Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were too uncanny.
It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t.
Here is your money—all shillings, except two half-crowns.
Would you count it?
You can settle your debt nicely now.” Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source.” “Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle.
“George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?” Miss Bartlett considered.
“For instance, the driver.
I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.” Lucy shuddered a little.
“We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren’t careful.
How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?” “We must think of every possibility.” “Oh, it’s all right.” “Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows.
In fact, he is certain to know.” “I don’t care if he does.
I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.” “To contradict it?” “No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best.
Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
Ladies are certainly different.” “Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully.
“You kind, anxious thing.
What _would_ you have me do?
First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say, ‘Tell’.
Which is it to be?
Quick!” Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest.
I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
You will never forgive me.” “Shall we go out, then.
They will smash all the china if we don’t.” For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again.
Have you seen the young one yet?” “Yes, I have.” “What happened?” “We met at the Rectory.” “What line is he taking up?” “No line.
He talked about Italy, like any other person.
It is really all right.
What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way.
He really won’t be any nuisance, Charlotte.” “Once a cad, always a cad.
That is my poor opinion.” Lucy paused.
“Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
It was a new one from Smith’s library.
Her mother must have returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
I don’t think we ought to blame him very much.
It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
He has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into tears.
He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big railways—not a porter!
and runs down to his father for week-ends.
Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
There!
Now for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm.
“Suppose we don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.” Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
Explanations took place, and in the midst of them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain.
Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most of the days of that year.
In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold.
Up on the heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.
Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path.
From the house came incoherent sounds, as of females preparing for worship.
“The men say they won’t go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her, no nonsense”—“Anne!
Mary!
Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine.
Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously.
The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender shadow.
But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window.
Her new cerise dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan.
At her throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an engagement ring.
Her eyes are bent to the Weald.
She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.
In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills.
“Lucy!
Lucy!
What’s that book?
Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?” “It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.” “But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.” Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a Loggia.
She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up.
It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil had said, “What!
you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?” She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.
I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child?
Minnie!
That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!)
Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late.
Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse, never the carriage.
“Where’s Charlotte?
Run up and hurry her.
Why is she so long?
She had nothing to do.
She never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses!
Minnie!” Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting.
As usual, she didn’t see why.
Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men?
The young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words.
Mrs. Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but sovereigns and half crowns.
Could any one give me—” “Yes, easily.
Jump in.
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock!
You put us all to shame.” “If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully.
She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse.
The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
“Good-bye!
Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering.
On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation.
He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.
All that he said on this subject pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church.
There was a line of carriages down the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa.
To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother.
“Unless the young man considers that he knows me already.” He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally.
Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how glad he was that she was going to be married.
She said yes, she was glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice; she had never known him offended before.
He added: “We find, though, that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing.
I am very much upset about it.” “I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,” said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further.
“He thought we should be artistic.
He is disappointed.” “And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up.
What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly.
She must avoid censuring Cecil.
For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned, though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says.
He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall.
Yet it does seem so unkind.” “There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“That’s exactly what I say.
Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?” “There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,” he continued in measured tones.
“We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.
Choose a place where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!” “Eh—?” “I see you’re going to be clever.
I hope you didn’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy.” George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
“He behaved that way to me.
It is his philosophy.
Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first.” “What _do_ you mean?
No, never mind what you mean.
Don’t explain.
He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
Do you play tennis?
Do you mind tennis on Sunday—?” “George mind tennis on Sunday!
George, after his education, distinguish between Sunday—” “Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.
No more do I. That’s settled.
Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased.” He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans.” “I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck.
The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the morning sun?
She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.” “Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady.
Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow.
It was the pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow.
Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered.
He said: “I—I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house.
Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them.
“George has been in such good spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.” Lucy caught her cousin’s eye.
Something in its mute appeal made her reckless.
“Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven.
Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy.
All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things.
It was not an exploit.
He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her hand to her cheek.
“He does not love me.
No.
How terrible if he did!
But he has not told.
He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right.
It’s a secret between us two for ever.
Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room.
The secret, big or little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world.
Thus she interpreted her joy.
She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so safe.
As he helped her out of the carriage, she said: “The Emersons have been so nice.
George Emerson has improved enormously.” “How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them, and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth.
For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected.
He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are.
George Emerson is coming up this afternoon.
He is a most interesting man to talk to.
Only don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks.
Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal.
Generally Lucy was depressed at meals.
Some one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will not last, this cheerfulness.
In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee.
Her mother would always sit there, her brother here.
The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would never be hidden behind the western hills.
After luncheon they asked her to play.
She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.
Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.” She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round.
There George was.
He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
Cecil should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson.
Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.
She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano.
“I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.” “Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil.
“I will not spoil the set.” He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil.
I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s Emerson.” George corrected him: “I am not bad.” One looked down one’s nose at this.
“Then certainly I won’t play,” said Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse.
You had much better not play.
Much better not.” Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would play.
“I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall back on Lucy.
There is no other way out of it.
Lucy, go and change your frock.” Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature.
She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon.
As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner.
She liked music, but how much better tennis seemed.
How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms.
Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child.
George served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
The hills stood out above its radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara.
She might be forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her.
He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others.
He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke.
When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.” “What fun, Cecil!
Read away.
Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!” “Do you mind being beaten?” She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a splendid player, though.
The light was behind you, and it was in my eyes.” “I never said I was.” “Why, you did!” “You didn’t attend.” “You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house.
We all exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.” “‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset.
Leonora was speeding—’” Lucy interrupted.
“Leonora?
Is Leonora the heroine?
Who’s the book by?” “Joseph Emery Prank.
‘Sunset.
Leonora speeding across the square.
Pray the saints she might not arrive too late.
Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it now—’” Lucy burst into laughter.
“‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed!
Why it’s Miss Lavish!
It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under somebody else’s name.” “Who may Miss Lavish be?” “Oh, a dreadful person—Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?” Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up.
“Of course I do.
I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street.
It was she who told me that you lived here.” “Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean something else.
She watched his head, which was almost resting against her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening.
“No wonder the novel’s bad,” she added.
“I never liked Miss Lavish.
But I suppose one ought to read it as one’s met her.” “All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature.
“Every one writes for money in these days.” “Oh, Cecil—!” “It is so.
I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow.
The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her.
She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?” “I never notice much difference in views.” “What do you mean?” “Because they’re all alike.
Because all that matters in them is distance and air.” “H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.” “I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up.
Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.” He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured.
“I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again.
I’m so sorry he’s not so well.” “No, he isn’t well.” “There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil.
“Also that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.” “Mr.
Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?” “None.
Why?” “You spoke of ‘us.’” “My mother, I was meaning.” Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!” “I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” “I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.
It is the first thing that I remember.” Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after tennis—he didn’t do.
He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.” “Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.” “No—read away.
I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud.
If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.” This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him.
It put their visitor in the position of a prig.
Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr.
Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book.
Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked.
But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning.
“Find me chapter two, if it isn’t bothering you.” Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.” She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.” He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone.
Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village.
The season was spring.’” Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose, for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read.
He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence, while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets.
All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’” Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use.
No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’” “This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last.
She thought a disaster was averted.
But when they entered the shrubbery it came.
The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring.
That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove.
Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I must write some letters,” and went up to her room.
Then she prepared for action.
Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty.
Perhaps there never is such a contest.
It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first aim was to defeat herself.
As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been.
Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him.
The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.
In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
“Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?” Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.
“There is a scene in it.
The hero and heroine make love.
Do you know about that?” “Dear—?” “Do you know about it, please?” she repeated.
“They are on a hillside, and Florence is in the distance.” “My good Lucia, I am all at sea.
I know nothing about it whatever.” “There are violets.
I cannot believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her?
I have thought before speaking; it _must_ be you.” “Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.” Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved.
“Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t put that in her book?” Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it.
Yes.” “Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” “So you did tell?” “I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of conversation—” “But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell mother?” “I will never forgive Eleanor.
She has betrayed my confidence.” “Why did you tell her, though?
This is a most serious thing.” Why does any one tell anything?
The question is eternal, and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response.
She had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again.
Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes?
Behind Cecil’s back as we were walking up the garden.” Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now?
Can you tell me?” “Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day.
Fancy if your prospects—” “I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word.
“I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.” It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince.
“However,” said the girl, despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done.
You have put me in a most awkward position.
How am I to get out of it?” Miss Bartlett could not think.
The days of her energy were over.
She was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that.
She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him?
I can’t tell mother now—owing to you.
Nor Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you.
I am caught up every way.
I think I shall go mad.
I have no one to help me.
That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.” Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing.
What’s to be _done?_ We women go maundering on.
What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?” “I always said he was a cad, dear.
Give me credit for that, at all events.
From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a bath.” “Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong!
We’ve both made a muddle of it.
George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he to be left unpunished, or isn’t he?
I want to know.” Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless.
Her own exposure had unnerved her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain.
She moved feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?” “Willingly would I move heaven and earth—” “I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously.
“Will you speak to him?
It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word.” “Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.” “It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture.
“No one will help me.
I will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below.
“Found the lost ball?
Good man!
Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you!
I admire you—” They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul.
Her anger faded at the sight of him.
Ah!
The Emersons were fine people in their way.
She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying: “Freddy has taken him into the dining-room.
The others are going down the garden.
Come.
Let us get this over quickly.
Come.
I want you in the room, of course.” “Lucy, do you mind doing it?” “How can you ask such a ridiculous question?” “Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand.
“I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded.
She remembered their last evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss Bartlett’s toque on the door.
She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time.
Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying.
“The jam’s jolly good.” George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room.
As she entered he stopped, and said: “No—nothing to eat.” “You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants.
Where’s mother?” “She’s started on her Sunday writing.
She’s in the drawing-room.” “That’s all right.
You go away.” He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table.
Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech.
She just said: “I can’t have it, Mr. Emerson.
I cannot even talk to you.
Go out of this house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door.
“I hate a row.
Go please.” “What—” “No discussion.” “But I can’t—” She shook her head.
“Go, please.
I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.” “You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t mean that you are going to marry that man?” The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her.
“You are merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse.
He’s only for an acquaintance.
He is for society and cultivated talk.
He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.” It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss—” “No, but have you ever?
He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.
It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.
I would never have let myself go.
But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters.
Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.
That is the man all over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find.
Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to settle whether you were shocked or no.
Cecil all over again.
He daren’t let a woman decide.
He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.
Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon.
Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’ because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control.
I’m not ashamed.
I don’t apologize.
But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you.
Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly?
But therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.” Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson.
Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.” And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality.
He said: “Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary.
“I’m the same kind of brute at bottom.
This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He thought.
“Yes—really in a better way.
I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards her.
“Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain.
I have cared for you since that man died.
I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun.
As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered.
I called.
I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.” “And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm.
“Does he not matter?
That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly?
A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?” He said: “It is our last chance.
I shall do all that I can.” And as if he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening.
“You wouldn’t stop us this second time if you understood,” he said.
“I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.” Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though demolishing some invisible obstacle.
She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
“It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really.
It is that love and youth matter intellectually.” In silence the two women watched him.
His last remark, they knew, was nonsense, but was he going after it or not?
Would not he, the cad, the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish?
No.
He was apparently content.
He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house.
Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!” Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet.
“Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the latter.
One more fuss through with you, Charlotte.
Many thanks.
I think, though, that this is the last.
My admirer will hardly trouble me again.” And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish: “Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it?
Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really.
It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.” “Let’s go down to them.” But, once in the open air, she paused.
Some emotion—pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring.
That something or other mattered intellectually?
A leaf, violently agitated, danced past her, while other leaves lay motionless.
That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy!
There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll hurry.” “Mr.
Emerson has had to go.” “What a nuisance!
That spoils the four.
I say, Cecil, do play, do, there’s a good chap.
It’s Floyd’s last day.
Do play tennis with us, just this once.” Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete.
As you well remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you.” The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes.
How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement.
Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered.
He had nothing to say.
He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things over.
We are too different.
I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.” It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—” “I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
“My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.” “I don’t understand you.
You aren’t like yourself.
You’re tired, Lucy.” “Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once.
“That is exactly like you.
You always think women don’t mean what they say.” “Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.” “What if I do?
It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth.
I can’t marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.” “You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches.
But give me a moment’s time.” He closed his eyes.
“You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.” It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
To bring on the crisis, she said: “There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.” “I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never could play.
I don’t understand a word you say.” “You can play well enough to make up a four.
I thought it abominably selfish of you.” “No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis.
Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
You talked of our wedding at lunch—at least, you let me talk.” “I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly.
“I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
Of course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.” She developed this position.
“Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted to be my husband?
I don’t think so.
You don’t like Freddy, nor my mother.
There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point.
They have to-day.
I see clearly.
I must speak.
That’s all.” “I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently.
“I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
It’s all too horrible.” “What’s the good of a scene?” “No good.
But surely I have a right to hear a little more.” He put down his glass and opened the window.
From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy or any one might be outside.” He obeyed.
“I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved me!” “I did not,” she said.
“I thought I did at first.
I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.” He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
She had counted on his being petty.
It would have made things easier for her.
By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently.
I dare say you are right not to.
But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.” “Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort who can’t know any one intimately.” A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that.
But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
It is that, more or less.
When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always protecting me.” Her voice swelled.
“I won’t be protected.
I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
To shield me is an insult.
Can’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
A woman’s place!
You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
That’s why I break off my engagement.
You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause.
Then Cecil said with great emotion: “It is true.” “True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word.
It is a revelation.
It is—I.” “Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.” He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true.
I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
You are even greater than I thought.” She withdrew a step.
“I’m not going to worry you.
You are far too good to me.
I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
I have never known you till this evening.
I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—” “What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance.
She cried: “If you think I am in love with some one else, you are very much mistaken.” “Of course I don’t think that.
You are not that kind, Lucy.” “Oh, yes, you do think it.
It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting, brutal!
As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.” He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past.
I shall never say it again.
You have taught me better.” She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity.
I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.” “All right, Cecil, that will do.
Don’t apologize to me.
It was my mistake.” “It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke.
“I must actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really am.
Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
Will you shake hands?” “Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
“Good-night, Cecil.
Good-bye.
That’s all right.
I’m sorry about it.
Thank you very much for your gentleness.” “Let me light your candle, shall I?” They went into the hall.
“Thank you.
Good-night again.
God bless you, Lucy!” “Good-bye, Cecil.” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry.
In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself.
She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within.
They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
As the years pass, they are censured.
Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one.
The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill.
On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy Corner,—he laughed.
The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.
The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road.
So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly.
Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.
One might laugh at the house, but one never shuddered.
Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip.
He had heard from the Miss Alans.
These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed their plans.
They were going to Greece instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter.
Of course, Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train.
But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.” Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her.
She would see the fun of it, and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty.
Though she was hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she could not play the piano as she did.
He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been understood.
This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been illustrated by facts.
Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.
Therefore it must be the horse, who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy.
They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs.
Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station.
They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it.
“Isn’t it wonderful?
Isn’t it romance?
Most certainly they will go to Constantinople.
They are taken in a snare that cannot fail.
They will end by going round the world.” Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious!
I never notice it in you young people; you do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing.
‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn!
No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans.
They want the Pension Keats.” “I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you any matches?” “I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?” “Never.” “Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit.
I haven’t been to Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my friends going.
It is altogether too big for our little lot.
Don’t you think so?
Italy is just about as much as we can manage.
Italy is heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus.
All right, Freddy—I am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
“I was saying, if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience.
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me.
There the contrast is just as much as I can realize.
But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the victoria.” “You’re quite right,” said Cecil.
“Greece is not for our little lot”; and he got in.
Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really.
And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box, which had not been returned.
As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
Cecil’s hard hit.
Lucy won’t marry him.
If you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down.” “But when—” “Late last night.
I must go.” “Perhaps they won’t want me down there.” “No—go on.
Good-bye.” “Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart.
The house was again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata.
He hesitated a moment, but went down the garden as requested.
There he found a mournful company.
It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of assistance.
At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe?
Gracious what a mess everything is!
Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.” Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her.
“You have worried them as much as they can stand.
Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly.
I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.” “Oh, must you?
Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it.” Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about for, either in the house or out of it.” Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.
As they walked up the garden, the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother.
Or will she come with us?” “I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.” “They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has gone, and Freddy won’t play with me.
In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.” “Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur.
“Go and put on your boots.” He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart.
She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do?
Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive.
Would you come too?” “I don’t think I will, thank you.” “No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.” Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!” “Yes.” “I met them on the hill.
Your brother told me.” “Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed.
Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.” “Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have done the right thing.” “So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.” “I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.” “So does mother.
Mother minds dreadfully.” “I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.
It was really a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.” “Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he?
I gathered that he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.” “Boys are so odd.” Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor.
Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel.
Mr. Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action, so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan.
That was really what brought me over.
I thought it might amuse you all.” “How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.
After a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with “Going abroad?
When do they start?” “Next week, I gather.” “Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
Always complaisant, he put the letter away.
But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!
How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad!” “I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast!” She laughed heartily.
“Oh, delightful!
I wish they’d take me.” “Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel?
Perhaps George Emerson is right.
He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’” “Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople.
I have always longed to go to Constantinople.
Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?” Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm.
She had always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed.
He saw, to his surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends, after Cissie Villa.” “Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would give anything to go with them.” “Would your mother spare you again so soon?
You have scarcely been home three months.” “She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement.
“I simply _must_ go away.
I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
“Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away?
I didn’t realize at the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.” “You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—” “Yes, yes.
I knew you’d understand.” Mr. Beebe did not quite understand.
Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family?
Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her.
Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying.
He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down.” “I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all.
Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so masterful.
I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
He would improve me in places where I can’t be improved.
Cecil won’t let a woman decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t.
What nonsense I do talk!
But that is the kind of thing.” “It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you.
I do sympathize and agree most profoundly.
I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?” “But I must go somewhere!” she cried.
“I have been worrying all the morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with clenched fists, and repeated: “I must!
And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
You all think much too highly of me.
I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased.
“I must get away, ever so far.
I must know my own mind and where I want to go.” “Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out of the front-door.
He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource.
She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be.
I know all about it.
The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak.” Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett.
As he had put it to himself at Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
He assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter drop.” “I wonder.” “It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street.
It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at the present moment.” Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows.
Death is a strong word—surely too strong.
There was no question of tragedy.
He said: “Of course, Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she chooses.
Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.” “I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly.
“Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you.
One cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy.
A chance word to a chattering friend, and—” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
A rector lives in a web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he will regard them.
He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately?
I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish.
It is odd how we of that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another’s lives.
Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.
We must really give the Signora a testimonial.” And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern.
On the summit they paused.
The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue.
Summer was retreating.
The wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven.
The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery.
Mr. Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.” They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.
That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably.
Mr. Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces.
They would hand the child her food through the window.
Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past.
I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit.
She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her.
But the future.
Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again.
“I don’t know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.” Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.” To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you.
In it I spy Lucy’s salvation.” “Really.
Now, why?” “She wanted to leave Windy Corner.” “I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to say—selfish.” “It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire a change.” Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect misses.
Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced.
Perhaps she must have a change.
I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand these things.
But why need she go as far as Greece?” “You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner.
“Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?)
Why not Tunbridge Wells?
Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning.
I cannot help her.
I will say no more.
Perhaps I have already said too much.
I am not to talk.
I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.” Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance.
I know too well that I get on Lucy’s nerves.
Our tour was a failure.
She wanted to leave Florence, and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.” “Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe.
“I want your advice.” “Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to him, though familiar to Lucy.
“I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?” Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd woman really did know.
“She must not stop here a moment, and we must keep quiet till she goes.
I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already.
Only, Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone.
If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—” “Otherwise—?” “Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.” Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude.
The tavern sign—a beehive trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him.
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another man” that would have attracted a grosser mind.
He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form.
Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry.
His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.
“They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure.
In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity.
The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement.
Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the action of others.
The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey.
He conversed on indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants; Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could literature influence life?
Windy Corner glimmered.
In the garden, Mrs. Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly.
“This comes of putting off.
We might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece.
I don’t know what the world’s coming to.” “Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must.
Come up to the house and let’s talk it over.
Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?” “Mr.
Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.” “So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good.
Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone.
It was expensive and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed.
Nor would Charlotte have succeeded.
The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right.
It must be something I can’t understand.
Lucy!
Let’s tell her.
Lucy!” “She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said.
He opened the door, and heard the words of a song: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.” “I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.” “Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——” “It’s a song that Cecil gave her.
How odd girls are!” “What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly.
She went into the drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.” Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a bit.” “And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you.” “Oh, splendid!
Oh, thank you!” Mr. Beebe followed.
Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys.
She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness.
Her mother bent over her.
Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_, in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and therefore ignored by the art of to-day.
Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens,” she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.” “Mr.
Beebe knows my rude ways.” “It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he.
“Go on.” “It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly.
“I forget why—harmony or something.” “I suspected it was unscholarly.
It’s so beautiful.” “The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten.
Why throw up the sponge?” “How stupidly you talk!” said his sister.
The _Santa Conversazione_ was broken up.
After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.” “Stop thine ear against the singer—” “Wait a minute; she is finishing.” “From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” “I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear.
She had behaved splendidly, and he had helped her.
He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl’s life.
If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—” Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly.
He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned: “Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX Lying to Mr. Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial England.
They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books, mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.
Miss Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one’s face in the train.
Lucy promised, a little depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.
A gentleman is such a stand-by.” Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine continued.
“It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.
But perhaps he will come out and join you later on.” “Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off.
I do so long to see him.” “No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“She doesn’t like it.” “No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really?
How funny!
I should have thought that in this case—” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going?
It is such a pleasure to have met you!” They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right.
We just got through that time.” But her mother was annoyed.
“I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it.
There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.” Lucy had plenty to say in reply.
She described the Miss Alans’ character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?” “Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then.
It’s much pleasanter.
How wet it is!
Let’s turn in here.” “Here” was the British Museum.
Mrs. Honeychurch refused.
If they must take shelter, let it be in a shop.
Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.
Let’s go to Mudie’s.
I’ll buy a guide-book.” “You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this hole-and-corner work.
You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute.
But why not announce it?
Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?” “It’s only for a few days.” “But why at all?” Lucy was silent.
She was drifting away from her mother.
It was quite easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the incidental advantage of being true.
But she could not say it.
She disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors—Light.
Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent.
She was thinking, “My daughter won’t answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me.
Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.” This was perfectly true.
Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no longer.
It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.
She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk!
Of course I’m not tired of Windy Corner.” “Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?” She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.” “Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?” “Hush, mother!
People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s.
She bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
You see, I come into my money next year.” Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed “eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear.
“I’ve seen the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy.
I have seen so little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like to-day, but to stop.
I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl.” “And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police.
And call it a Mission—when no one wants you!
And call it Duty—when it means that you can’t stand your own home!
And call it Work—when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is!
And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.” “I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys.
But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well.
Take your independence and be gone.
Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.” Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed.
“How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!” “_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.
“More every moment.” “I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike.” “Well, I see the likeness.
The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters.” “What rubbish!
And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you asked her to stop.
I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.” Lucy clenched her teeth.
“My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked Charlotte to stop.
I wish you would keep to the point.” And the conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station.
It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy.
Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful.
“The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked.
For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old mother.
“We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining.
Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was blurred by the soft road.
“_Can’t_ we have the hood down?” she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck.
But now that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?” “It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?” “Yes, miss, they have gone.” Lucy sank back.
The carriage stopped at the Rectory.
She got out to call for Miss Bartlett.
So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary.
Waste!
That word seemed to sum up the whole of life.
Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded her mother.
Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible.
Other people had.
When the maid opened the door, she was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a great favour: might she go to church?
Mr. Beebe and his mother had already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily.
“I forgot it was Friday.
Let’s all go.
Powell can go round to the stables.” “Lucy dearest—” “No church for me, thank you.” A sigh, and they departed.
The church was invisible, but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour.
This was a stained window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation.
Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?
There was only that one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait, sir.” Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips.
George she had faced, and could have faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry!
George is so sorry!
He thought he had a right to try.
I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first.
He ought not to have tried.
I knew nothing about it at all.” If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand.
“But you must not scold him.” Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love.
I said: ‘When love comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind.
No.
Passion is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my day is over, and though there is the result.
Poor boy!
He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that whatever you felt you did not mean.
Yet”—his voice gathered strength: he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?” Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries.
Holding it up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son.” “But you do remember it?” “He has misbehaved himself from the first.” “I only was told that he loved you last Sunday.
I never could judge behaviour.
I—I—suppose he has.” Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to him.
His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said.
“I am glad he is sorry.
Do you know what he did?” “Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction.
“He only tried when he should not have tried.
You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are going to marry the man you love.
Do not go out of George’s life saying he is abominable.” “No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong.
I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all.
My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late—” “Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?” “Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.” “As his mother did.” “But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr.
Emerson_—what are you talking about?” “When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round.
She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered.
“Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in again!
A judgement!
And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church!
Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch?
Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever?” “I don’t know,” gasped Lucy.
“I don’t understand this sort of thing.
I was not meant to understand it.” “But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his principles.
I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was well she was ill.
He made her think about sin, and she went under thinking about it.” It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man.
“I did hold firm.” And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what cost!—he had won a victory over them.
“My boy shall go back to the earth untouched.” She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill. “Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present.
“George last Sunday—no, not ill: just gone under.
He is never ill.
But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
It was always touch and go.
He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live.
He will never think anything worth while.
You remember that church at Florence?” Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible.
Then we took the house here, and he goes bathing with your brother, and became better.
You saw him bathing?” “I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair.
I am deeply sorry about it.” “Then there came something about a novel.
I didn’t follow it at all; I had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old.
Ah, well, one must have failures.
George comes down to-morrow, and takes me up to his London rooms.
He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be where he is.” “Mr.
Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my account.
I am going to Greece.
Don’t leave your comfortable house.” It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled.
“How good everyone is!
And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning and heard I was going!
Here I am so comfortable with a fire.” “Yes, but you won’t go back to London.
It’s absurd.” “I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he can’t.
He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t.
I’ve been bother enough to the world by now.
I can’t have you moving out of your house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my account.
You must stop!
I am just going to Greece.” “All the way to Greece?” Her manner altered.
“To Greece?” “So you must stop.
You won’t talk about this business, I know.
I can trust you both.” “Certainly you can.
We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the life that you have chosen.” “I shouldn’t want—” “I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George?
No, it was wrong of George to try.
We have pushed our beliefs too far.
I fancy that we deserve sorrow.” She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling.
To Lucy who could not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still.
I think I will sit in the carriage.” “Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.” “Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you.
And what were you saying about going abroad?” She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands.
Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you.
I hope—it isn’t because George spoke that you are both going?” “No.” “I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.” “Thank you.” At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church.
His cassock was covered with rain.
“That’s all right,” he said kindly.
“I counted on you two keeping each other company.
It’s pouring again.
The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it.
Did Powell go round?” “I think so; I’ll see.” “No—of course, I’ll see.
How are the Miss Alans?” “Very well, thank you.” “Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?” “I—I did.” “Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the two Miss Alans?
Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm.
I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely.
“I made a slip.
Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England.” Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man.
To George, to Cecil, she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece.
And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving him?
You are leaving the man you love?” “I—I had to.” “Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?” Terror came over her, and she lied again.
She made the long, convincing speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more.
He heard her in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.
It seems to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.” She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world.
It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so dreadful.
It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the things that I might have avoided.
We can help one another but little.
I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle.
Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren’t?
Do you remember before, when you refused the room with the view?
Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent.
“Don’t trust me, Miss Honeychurch.
Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was still silent.
“‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’ I think he puts it well.
Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean.
You love George!” And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
“You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
You won’t marry the other man for his sake.” “How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man.” “But you are.” She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.
It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way.
You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat.
I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and _for which_ you marry.
I know that, with George, you will find them, and that you love him.
Then be his wife.
He is already part of you.
Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part.
You will wish that it was.
You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.
I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the body.
Ah!
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that!
Ah!
for a little directness to liberate the soul!
Your soul, dear Lucy!
I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round.
But we have souls.
I cannot say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining yours.
I cannot bear it.
It is again the darkness creeping in; it is hell.” Then he checked himself.
“What nonsense I have talked—how abstract and remote!
And I have made you cry!
Dear girl, forgive my prosiness; marry my boy.
When I think what life is, and how seldom love is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made.” She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.
Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
“Cecil—Mr.
Beebe—the ticket’s bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair.
“I’m caught in the tangle.
I must suffer and grow old away from him.
I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
They trusted me.” A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only.
Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—” “No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—” “But why should they, when you have deceived them?” Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.” “You’re not worthy of their trust.” “What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?” “One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson.
To whom do you refer?
Trust whom?” “I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George.
They have loved one another all along.” Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman.
A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?” “Mr.
Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—” “Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!” “It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly.
“It’s the part of people that you don’t understand.” Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy!
Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr.
Beebe, could you help me?” He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am more grieved than I can possibly express.
It is lamentable, lamentable—incredible.” “What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me.
Marry George, Miss Honeychurch.
He will do admirably.” He walked out and left them.
They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair.
But his face revived her.
It was the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark.
Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know.
But remember the mountains over Florence and the view.
Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise.
George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him.
Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.” “You kiss me,” said the girl.
“You kiss me.
I will try.” He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his salutation remained.
He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he managed to strengthen her.
It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once.” Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves.
They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf.
They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity.
Trembling, anxious, cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go round the world.
The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had your father’s room.
I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.” He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.” “Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window.
It was evening and again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully.
“What can such people be made of?” “Same stuff as parsons are made of.” “Nonsense!” “Quite right.
It is nonsense.” “Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.” “Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and advancing his face to hers.
“What’s there to cry at?
Kiss me here.” He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all.
When it came to the point, it was she who remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who knew whose room this had been last year.
It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.” “Now kiss me here; then here.” Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window, opened it (as the English will), and leant out.
There was the parapet, there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills.
The cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago.
A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool.
He had helped himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its name is, still shows.” “San Miniato.
I’ll just finish your sock.” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils, the Miss Bartletts!
Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?” “Not yet.” His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?” “Silly boy!
He thinks he’s being dignified.
He knew we should go off in the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands.
They had fair warning, and now he calls it an elopement.
Ridiculous boy—” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” “But it will all come right in the end.
He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women.
He has, for the second time, quite altered.
Why will men have theories about women?
I haven’t any about men.
I wish, too, that Mr. Beebe—” “You may well wish that.” “He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us again.
I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner.
I wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run.” “Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only thing I did do—and you came back to me.
So possibly you know.” He turned back into the room.
“Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to the window, so that she, too, saw all the view.
They sank upon their knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one another’s names.
Ah!
it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—” “Oh, bother that man!” But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte.
How cruel she would be to a man like that!” “Look at the lights going over the bridge.” “But this room reminds me of Charlotte.
How horrible to grow old in Charlotte’s way!
To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house.
For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
You couldn’t have made me.
When I am very happy”—she kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs.
If Charlotte had only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to silly Greece, and become different for ever.” “But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely.
He said so.” “Oh, no, she didn’t see him.
She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church.
She said so.” George was obstinate again.
“My father,” said he, “saw her, and I prefer his word.
He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett.
A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up.
He didn’t speak to her.” Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other’s arms.
It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting.
George, who disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew.
Then, why did she risk the meeting?
She knew he was there, and yet she went to church.” They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind.
She rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?” “Mean what?” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.” “Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.” “Niente.” The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?” He whispered: “Is it this?
Is this possible?
I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped.
That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down.
That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped.
I can’t explain her any other way.
Can you?
Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable.
The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend.
There are details—it burnt.
I read the book afterwards.
She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through.
She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
We can never make friends with her or thank her.
But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.” “It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.” Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited, love attained.
But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean.
[Illustration] A Room With A View By E. M. Forster CONTENTS PART ONE Chapter I The Bertolini “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at all.
She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart.
Oh, Lucy!” “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the Signora’s unexpected accent.
“It might be London.” She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A.
Oxon.
), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London?
I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside.
I suppose it is one’s being so tired.” “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno.
The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.
The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!” “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that you shouldn’t have a view.” Lucy felt that she had been selfish.
“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of course, you must look over the Arno, too.
I meant that.
The first vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no.
You must have it.” “I insist on it.
Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.” “She would never forgive _me_.” The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a little peevish.
They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument.
He said: “I have a view, I have a view.” Miss Bartlett was startled.
Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.
She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she glanced at him.
He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes.
There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes.
These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim.
So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A view?
Oh, a view!
How delightful a view is!” “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George.
He has a view too.” “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have yours.
We’ll change.” The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.
Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.” “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.” “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy.
Her cousin again repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted.
“Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son.
“There’s nothing else to say.” He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful.
Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before.
Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change?
What possible objection had she?
They would clear out in half an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality.
It was impossible to snub any one so gross.
Her face reddened with displeasure.
She looked around as much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are genteel.” “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear.
This pension is a failure.
To-morrow we will make a change.” Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness.
Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh!
Why, it’s Mr. Beebe!
Oh, how perfectly lovely!
Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are.
Oh!” Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint: “How do you do, Mr. Beebe?
I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.” The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.
But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
“Just fancy how small the world is.
Summer Street, too, makes it so specially funny.” “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—” “Yes, I heard from mother so last week.
She didn’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr.
Beebe is—’” “Quite right,” said the clergyman.
“I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June.
I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.” “Oh, how glad I am!
The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.” “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.” “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.” He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons.
He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before.
It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field.
“Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded.
“The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.” “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table.
“Mr.
Beebe, you are wrong.
The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.” “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin.
“We are in luck.” And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them.
People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would grow upon them.
The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do.
Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them.
And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato!
They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words.
I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.” The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did.
It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more than cloth.
Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her daughter.
It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.
Was this really Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.
She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle.
“We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.
“The first evening means so much.
When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.” He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?” “Emerson.” “Is he a friend of yours?” “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.” “Then I will say no more.” He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing.
His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.” “You acted very naturally,” said he.
He seemed thoughtful, and after a few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of accepting.” “No _harm_, of course.
But we could not be under an obligation.” “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show gratitude.
He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he means.
He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them.
He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite.
It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.” Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice.” “I think he is; nice and tiresome.
I differ from him on almost every point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores.
When he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up.
He has no tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will not keep his opinions to himself.
We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.” “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?” Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?” “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet.
He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains.
Of course, he has all his father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.” “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett.
“So you think I ought to have accepted their offer?
You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?” “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.” “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?” He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared.
“Why didn’t you talk, Lucy?
He prefers young people, I’m sure.
I do hope I haven’t monopolized him.
I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time.” “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a clergyman.” “My dear Lucia—” “Well, you know what I mean.
And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.” “Funny girl!
How you do remind me of your mother.
I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe.” “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.” “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world.
I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.” “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine.
She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered.
Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.” And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more careful.
It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.” Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat.
Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room.
It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England.
Signora Bertolini is so English.” “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy.
“We dread going to bed.” “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed.
“If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful!
We were so sorry for you at dinner.” “I think he was meaning to be kind.” “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr.
Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature.
Of course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.” “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
No one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know.
No, he is not tactful; yet, have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?” “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.
“Are not beauty and delicacy the same?” “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly.
“But things are so difficult, I sometimes think.” She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms.
I’m so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again.
He has let me come and ask you.
He would be so pleased.” “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious.
I must apologize for my interference.” Gravely displeased, he turned to go.
Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours.
It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only here through your kindness.
If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it.
Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?” She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this.
I do not wish the acceptance to come from you.
Grant me that, at all events.” Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously: “Mr.
Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.” The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally.
But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out.” Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath.
All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first.
Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms!
It is all he can do to keep polite.” “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe.
Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.
“Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part.
Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature.
Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow.
Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said: “I think one might venture now.
No, Lucy, do not stir.
I will superintend the move.” “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear.
It is my affair.” “But I would like to help you.” “No, dear.” Charlotte’s energy!
And her unselfishness!
She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
So Lucy felt, or strove to feel.
And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful.
At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room.
Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.” Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him.
I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.” “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.
It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances.
It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation.
Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle.
Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson.
So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him.
Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.
It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
An electric tram came rushing underneath the window.
No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand.
Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go.
Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.
Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.
The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway.
Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.
So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone.
By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.
Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out?
Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone.
Miss Bartlett could not allow this.
Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin.
Oh, no!
that would never do.
Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person.
Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe.
Italians understand.
A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.
Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.” Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad.
The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.” Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut!
Miss Lucy!
I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He does but touch the surface of things.
As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it.
The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.” This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.
Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno.
How delightfully warm!
But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?
Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante.
San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story.
The men on the river were fishing.
(Untrue; but then, so is most information.)
Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried: “A smell!
a true Florentine smell!
Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.” “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
Buon giorno!
Buon giorno!” bowing right and left.
“Look at that adorable wine-cart!
How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!” So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.
It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno!
Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors.
_That_ is the true democracy.
Though I am a real Radical as well.
There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy.
“We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.” “I see, I see.
And now you have gone over to the enemy.” “Oh, please—!
If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right.
And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.” “Shameful!
A manufacturing district, I suppose?” “No—in the Surrey hills.
About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.” Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well.
It is full of the very nicest people.
Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?” “Very well indeed.” “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?” “Why, she rents a field of us!
How funny!” Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?” “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob.
“Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.” Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
Italy receded.
They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her.
And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed: “Bless us!
Bless us and save us!
We’ve lost the way.” Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window.
But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost!
lost!
My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.
How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do?
Two lone females in an unknown town.
Now, this is what _I_ call an adventure.” Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven!
And no, you are not, not, _not_ to look at your Baedeker.
Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it.
We will simply drift.” Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became discontented herself.
For one ravishing moment Italy appeared.
She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale.
There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven.
Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop, because it looked so typical.
It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown.
But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness.
Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically.
It was Santa Croce.
The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them.
I do detest conventional intercourse.
Nasty!
they are going into the church, too.
Oh, the Britisher abroad!” “We sat opposite them at dinner last night.
They have given us their rooms.
They were so very kind.” “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish.
“They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.
It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.” “What would you ask us?” Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she, at all events, would get full marks.
In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried: “There goes my local-colour box!
I must have a word with him!” And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes.
Then she began to get tired.
The beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places.
She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original.
But at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both gesticulating largely.
Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her Baedeker.
How could she find her way home?
How could she find her way about in Santa Croce?
Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in Florence again.
A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans.
Of course, it must be a wonderful building.
But how like a barn!
And how very cold!
Of course, it contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper.
But who was to tell her which they were?
She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
There was no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she began to be happy.
She puzzled out the Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.
She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed.
Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated.
What could this mean?
They did it again and again.
Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue.
Punishment followed quickly.
The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward.
She was too late.
He fell heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted forward also.
“Hard in life, hard in death.
Go out into the sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
Intolerable bishop!” The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and frightened!
But what else can you expect from a church?” The child’s legs had become as melting wax.
Each time that old Mr. Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar.
Fortunately an Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue.
By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
He stood.
Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson.
“You have done more than all the relics in the world.
I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy.
There is no scheme of the universe—” He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons.
She was determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply.
“But what are you doing here?
Are you doing the church?
Are you through with the church?” “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance.
“I came here with Miss Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.” “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.” “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
“I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded.
It’s worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker.
_That’s_ worth minding.” Lucy was puzzled.
She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where the idea would lead?
She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you.
I really came to help with the child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.” “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say.
You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious.
But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it.
Lucy could not get cross.
Mr. Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him.
On the other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him.
It was at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope.
It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will kindly tell me which they are.” The son nodded.
With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel.
There was a hint of the teacher about him.
She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared.
Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective.
Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true?
How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!” “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort!
Built by faith indeed!
That simply means the workmen weren’t paid properly.
And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
Look at that fat man in blue!
He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.” He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might.
The audience shifted uneasily, and so did Lucy.
She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her.
They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it?
Yes or no?” George replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all.
I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.” “You will never go up,” said his father.
“You and I, dear boy, will lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives.” “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is, going up.
It did happen like that, if it happened at all.” “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice.
“The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.” The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands.
They filed out of the chapel in silence.
Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“There’s plenty of room for us all.
Stop!” The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.” George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is.
I don’t remember.” “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
It’s that Mr.
Eager.
Why did he go?
Did we talk too loud?
How vexatious.
I shall go and say we are sorry.
Hadn’t I better?
Then perhaps he will come back.” “He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
Cuthbert Eager.
Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent.
The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her.
“He will try to be kind.” “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters.
But he is kind to people because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.” “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully—” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain.
Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness.
She saw him once again at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns.
Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only find solution in the night.
The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people.
They won’t come back.” “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy.
“Have you looked at those saints?” “Yes,” said Lucy.
“They are lovely.
Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin?” He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.
There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists.
But Mr. Emerson was only half interested.
He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily.
“I saw nothing in it.” “I like Giotto,” she replied.
“It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values.
Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
A baby is worth a dozen saints.
And my baby’s worth the whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.” Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated.
“He’s unhappy.” “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?
What more is one to give him?
And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God.
With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.” She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one.
She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked.
“He comes out for his holiday to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone.
Eh?
What did you say?” Lucy had made no suggestion.
Suddenly he said: “Now don’t be stupid over this.
I don’t require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me.
He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose?
But let yourself go.
You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night.
Let yourself go.
Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself.
It will be good for both of you.” To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.” “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.” “What things?” “The things of the universe.
It is quite true.
They don’t.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?” In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: “‘From far, from eve and morning, The stuff of life to knit me George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?
We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
But why should this make us unhappy?
Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice.
I don’t believe in this world sorrow.” Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us.
Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.” Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.
A young man melancholy because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried.
“You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then she became matronly.
“Oh, but your son wants employment.
Has he no particular hobby?
Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother.
Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.” The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it.
Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.
Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.
The dear George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd.
He approached, his face in the shadow.
He said: “Miss Bartlett.” “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective.
“Where?
Where?” “In the nave.” “I see.
Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson.
“Poor girl!” She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
“Poor girl?
I fail to understand the point of that remark.
I think myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you.
I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid time.
Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it.
Good-bye.
Thank you both so much for all your kindness.
Ah, yes!
there does come my cousin.
A delightful morning!
Santa Croce is a wonderful church.” She joined her cousin.
Chapter III Music, Violets, and the Letter “S” It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano.
She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected.
The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom.
Lucy had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.
Nor was she the passionate young lady, who performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the pictorial style.
And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory.
Victory of what and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano.
A few people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep.
She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarette-case.
Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it.
It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower.
The seats were filled with a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork.
Among the promised items was “Miss Honeychurch.
Piano.
Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III.
He was in suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends.
With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory.
He was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen.
The audience clapped, no less respectful.
It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners.
I do not consider her choice of a piece happy.
Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs.” “Introduce me.” “She will be delighted.
She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon.” “My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe.
“Why ever did she listen to it?” When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch, disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face.
She loved going to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and meringues.
He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also.
But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him: “If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting both for us and for her.” Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing!
Some one said just the same to mother, and she said she trusted I should never live a duet.” “Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?” “She doesn’t mind it.
But she doesn’t like one to get excited over anything; she thinks I am silly about it.
She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any one’s.
She has never got over it.
Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant—” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality.
She could not complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet.
The whole life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey, and the hills were dirty purple.
Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold, tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and a tickling cough in her throat.
On another day, when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray.
She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe.” “Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy.
This was a stock remark, the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition.
Miss Lavish was so original.
Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness.
For that, and for other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is writing a book?” “They do say so.” “What is it about?” “It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know.” “I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.
We started such friends.
But I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce.
Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.” “The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.” He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish.
They were always in each other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third.
Miss Lavish he believed he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning.
Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells?
All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work.
Girls like Lucy were charming to look at, but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped.
The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore.
But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse.
She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill!
And Mr. Beebe here besides.
Who would suppose this is Italy?
There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.” She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in my room with the door shut.
Doors shut; indeed, most necessary.
No one has the least idea of privacy in this country.
And one person catches it from another.” Lucy answered suitably.
Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.
The Italians are a most unpleasant people.
They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves.
We are at their mercy.
They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires.
From the cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial!
They have no conception of the intellectual life.
How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer over the children’s edjucaishion.
_Hi_ won’t ’ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’” Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way.
Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers.
Indeed, who would have supposed that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last the cause was disclosed.
From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “E.
L.” “That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman.
“A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she’d start a pipe.” “Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.
She took to it, practically in despair, after her life’s work was carried away in a landslip.
Surely that makes it more excusable.” “What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say they nearly always do.
Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink.
She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written.
The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she had an idea.
First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came here—this must on no account get round.
And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.” Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring.
She felt she had made almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.” Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade.
That old Mr. Emerson, who puts things very strangely—” Her jaw dropped.
She was silent.
Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper: “Stomach.
He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind.
I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden.
As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter.
But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought.
She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce.
Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson.
Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ Just imagine!
‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak.
I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking.
I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman!
I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place.
But that was not all.
After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.” “Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I shall go alone.’ She went.
At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.” “Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows.
No one will ever know.
Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.” “Mr.
Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice?
I do so want to know.” Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.
“No; but it is so difficult.
Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him.
Miss Alan, what do you think?
Is he nice?” The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.
Mr. Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying: “I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.” “Violets?
Oh, dear!
Who told you about the violets?
How do things get round?
A pension is a bad place for gossips.
No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce.
Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch!
It really was too bad.
No, I have quite changed.
I do _not_ like the Emersons.
They are _not_ nice.” Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly.
He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed.
He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them.
Miss Lavish, who represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans, who stood for good breeding, were following her.
Miss Bartlett, smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil.
The case of Lucy was different.
She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail.
After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now.
Even their seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once.
Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite politely, of course.” “Most right of her.
They don’t understand our ways.
They must find their level.” Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under.
They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son.
He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them.
It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle.
There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief.
“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said Lucy.
“I want to go round the town in the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say: “I wish we could.
Unluckily I have letters.
If you do want to go out alone, won’t you be better on your feet?” “Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!” But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her from the window, “and she knows it.
I put it down to too much Beethoven.” Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr. Beebe was right.
Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music.
She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan.
Conversation was tedious; she wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram.
This she might not attempt.
It was unladylike.
Why?
Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why.
It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different.
Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much.
But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.
The dragons have gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst.
She reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early Victorian song.
It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas!
the creature grows degenerate.
In her heart also there are springing up strange desires.
She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.
Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are alive.
Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
Nor has she any system of revolt.
Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she had done so.
This afternoon she was peculiarly restive.
She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved.
As she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus, being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it.
(A pity in art of course signified the nude.)
Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it.
She felt a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s “Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni Madonnas.
For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.
She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her to be conscious of it.
“The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to her.
The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it.
Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind.
It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.
An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him, and rest content.
Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.
It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky.
Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.
“Cinque lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest.
He frowned; he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all.
A crowd rose out of the dusk.
It hid this extraordinary man from her, and bore him away to the fountain.
Mr. George Emerson happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where the man had been.
How very odd!
Across something.
Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?” “Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything.
She had complained of dullness, and lo!
one man was stabbed, and another held her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade.
He must have carried her.
He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees.
She repeated: “Oh, what have I done?” “You fainted.” “I—I am very sorry.” “How are you now?” “Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home.
There’s no point in our stopping.” He held out his hand to pull her up.
She pretended not to see it.
The cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily.
The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been!
I might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well.
I can go alone, thank you.” His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?” “I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.
I must have dropped them out there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously.
“Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?” He added to his kindness.
As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!” She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.” “Yes, I am, thank you so very much.” “No, you aren’t.
You’d go openly if you were.” “But I had rather—” “Then I don’t fetch your photographs.” “I had rather be alone.” He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him.
“And don’t move till I come back.” In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in dreams.
The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day, and joined itself to earth.
How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square?
Again the thought occurred to her, “Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man, had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder.
Oddly enough, it was an easy topic.
She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before.
Being strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood.
She rose without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her, she walked firmly enough towards the Arno.
There a cabman signalled to them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police!
Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish.
When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?” He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?” “Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr.
Emerson!” “Well?” “Where are the photographs?” He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.” “I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.
Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood.
There!
I’m glad I’ve told you; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them.” He pointed down-stream.
“They’ve gone.” The river swirled under the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man.
“For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled.
It isn’t exactly that a man has died.” Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.” “Mr.
Emerson—” He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.” They were close to their pension.
She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment.
He did likewise.
There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship.
She moved her elbows before saying: “I have behaved ridiculously.” He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what came over me.” “I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.” “Oh, all right.” “And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?” “I’m afraid I don’t.” “I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?” “Your behaviour?
Oh, yes, all right—all right.” “Thank you so much.
And would you—” She could not carry her request any further.
The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
He had thrown her photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason.
It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man.
He would do her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might even have a high opinion of her.
But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe.
It was useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.
She had been in his arms, and he remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari’s shop.
It was not exactly that a man had died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents do happen, and then one returns to the old life!” “I don’t.” Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.” “But why, Mr. Emerson?
What do you mean?” “I shall want to live, I say.” Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno, whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson.
She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also.
They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.
It might have been most unpleasant.
Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone.
None of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the embankment.
Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure, not that she had encountered it.
This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action.
There were two plans between which she had to choose.
Mr. Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies.
Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?
Charlotte declined for herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.
But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth.
“It’s very kind of Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you.
I had much rather.” “Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.
How abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always!
But now she should alter.
All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the Lung’ Arno.
The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and colour.
Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it.
She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this, too!” Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did.
“Look, Lucia!
Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party.
I feared you would repent you of your choice.” Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.
Yesterday had been a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo.
Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not to re-enter it.
She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately remained.
Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria.
She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance.
For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.
She hailed them briskly.
The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett.
“After your despair of yesterday!
What a fortunate thing!” “Aha!
Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck.
Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?” “I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.” The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless creatures.
I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn’t pry.” She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few calculations in realism.
Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material.
A good deal of it was unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt.
The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note.
For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.” That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?” Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot.
But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish concluded.
“It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline.
There will be a deal of local colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall also introduce some humorous characters.
And let me give you all fair warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.” “Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett.
“I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons.” Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can.
For I repeat and I insist, and I have always held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life.” There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded.
Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett.
“That last remark struck me as so particularly true.
It should be a most pathetic novel.” Lucy assented.
At present her great aim was not to get put into it.
Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,” continued Miss Bartlett slowly.
“None but the superficial would be shocked at her.
We had a long talk yesterday.
She believes in justice and truth and human interest.
She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr.
Eager!
Why, how nice!
What a pleasant surprise!” “Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.” “We were chatting to Miss Lavish.” His brow contracted.
“So I saw.
Were you indeed?
Andate via!
sono occupato!” The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile.
“I am about to venture a suggestion.
Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a drive in the hills?
We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour’s ramble on the hillside.
The view thence of Florence is most beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape.
Decidedly.
But who looks at it to-day?
Ah, the world is too much for us.” Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that Mr.
Eager was no commonplace chaplain.
He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home.
He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent.
Tea at a Renaissance villa?
Nothing had been said about it yet.
But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same.
But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew.
A drive in the hills with Mr.
Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no longer the greatest of them.
She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain.
“In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity.
Andate via!
andate presto, presto!
Ah, the town!
Beautiful as it is, it is the town.” They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies.
To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and humiliating.” “Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened.
She can hardly bear to speak of it.” She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question.
“Do not blame her, please, Mr.
Eager.
The fault is mine: I left her unchaperoned.” “So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable.
His dark, handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.” “One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience.
I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?” Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—” “Were over at the Loggia.” “That must have saved you much.
You have not, of course, seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.” Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal league of Italy with youth.
He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr.
Eager, binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico’s angels.
She tore.
A shrill cry rose from the vendor.
The book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr.
Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a grievance.
His mysterious persecution of Mr.
Eager became relentless; the air rang with his threats and lamentations.
He appealed to Lucy; would not she intercede?
He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on bread.
He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued.
Under the chaplain’s guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy.
She had been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr.
Eager, she knew not why.
And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased to respect them.
She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist.
She doubted that Mr.
Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose.
They were tried by some new test, and they were found wanting.
As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte she was exactly the same.
It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact.
A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press.
I came across him at Brixton.” They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr.
Eager, “one has only sympathy for their success.
The desire for education and for social advance—in these things there is something not wholly vile.
There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as they would make of it.” “Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.” He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.” “Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead.
I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with me.
He was in my London parish long ago.
The other day in Santa Croce, when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him.
Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub.” “What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr.
Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended.
Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity.
Lucy, though she wished never to see the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man?
We know that already.” “Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all.
The boy—an innocent child at the time—I will exclude.
God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him.” “Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not hear.” “To speak plainly,” said Mr.
Eager, “it is.
I will say no more.” For the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the first time in her life.
“You have said very little.” “It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.
He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips.
It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily.
“That man murdered his wife!” “How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.
That day in Santa Croce—did they say anything against me?” “Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.” “Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you.
But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
“They’re nothing to me.” “How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene.
The shopman was possibly listening.
“She will find it difficult.
For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God.” The addition of God was striking.
But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
A silence followed which might have been impressive, but was merely awkward.
Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive.
“Drive?
Oh, is our drive to come off?” Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr.
Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed.
“It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all.
Why should he invite us in that absurd manner?
We might as well invite him.
We are each paying for ourselves.” Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish.” “How?” “Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.” “That will mean another carriage.” “Far worse.
Mr.
Eager does not like Eleanor.
She knows it herself.
The truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.” They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank.
Lucy stood by the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer, or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain.
The well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets?
Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it.
Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck.
She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank.
As she groped she murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr.
Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we must be prepared.
It is you they really want; I am only asked for appearances.
You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will follow behind.
A one-horse carriage would do for us.
Yet how difficult it is!” “It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.” “Oh, dear, Lucy!
I do hope Florence isn’t boring you.
Speak the word, and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.” “Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her mother’s letters could be.
She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway.
She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs.
Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news that interested her least.
“Do you know the Vyses?” “Oh, not that way back.
We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria.” “They’re nice people, the Vyses.
So clever—my idea of what’s really clever.
Don’t you long to be in Rome?” “I die for it!” The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant.
It has no grass, no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick.
By an odd chance—unless we believe in a presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity.
Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before.
Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly.
“Here’s an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel?
For I do know what I want.
I’m sick of Florence.
No, you said you’d go to the ends of the earth!
Do!
Do!” Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied: “Oh, you droll person!
Pray, what would become of your drive in the hills?” They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up the stony hill.
Mr. Beebe recognized him at once.
Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.
And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light.
To her Mr.
Eager objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition.
But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
She did not mind.
Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy.
The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss Lavish.
For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting Mr.
Eager, had doubled the size of the party.
And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus transformed.
Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.
But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr.
Eager, repressive towards Miss Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring.
She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate.
But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully.
In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy.
She had refused, not because she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he did know.
And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia, but by the river.
To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled emotion, but of the whole fabric.
There was really something blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word.
This sense of wickedness had been slight at first.
She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo.
But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again.
And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr.
Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling?
As a student of art?” “Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!” “Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like myself?” “Oh, no.
I am here as a tourist.” “Oh, indeed,” said Mr.
Eager.
“Are you indeed?
If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.
The result is, they mix up towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl.
You know the American girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’ There’s travelling for you.
Ha!
ha!
ha!” “I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit.
“The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.” “Quite so.
Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are here for trade, for example.
But the greater part are students.
Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico.
I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left.
No, you can only see it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall.
She is very proud of that thick hedge.
Inside, perfect seclusion.
One might have gone back six hundred years.
Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?” “It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish.
“Tell me, where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day?” But Mr.
Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr.
Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill.
“Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’?
He is working at Gemistus Pletho.
Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.” During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully.
Lucy had a spasm of envy.
Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.
They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road.
“Piano!
piano!” said Mr.
Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped his horses up again.
Now Mr.
Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or was he one of its manifestations?
The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.
“Piano!
piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.
Phaethon, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was most unpleasant.
The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr.
Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but at its manner.
At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and patted them on the back to signify his approval.
And Miss Lavish, though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried.
“But I dare say I shall receive scant support.
I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life.
This is what _I_ call an adventure.” “We must not submit,” said Mr.
Eager.
“I knew he was trying it on.
He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.” “Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood in no awe.
“Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there?
To be driven by lovers—A king might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I know.” Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect.
Mr.
Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will, was determined to make himself heard.
He addressed the driver again.
Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream, with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker, and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased.
Why should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto.
She pointed at the other carriage.
Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other.
Then Persephone got down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr.
Eager, smiting his hands together as the carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson.
“It is defeat.
You have parted two people who were happy.” Mr.
Eager shut his eyes.
He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but he would not speak to him.
The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took up the matter warmly.
He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money.
He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.
We have no rights over his soul.” Miss Lavish frowned.
It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said.
“He jolted us.” “That I deny.
It was as restful as sleeping.
Aha!
he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder?
He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is justified.
And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl, too.
It doesn’t do to injure young people.
Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici?” Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have.
Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature?” “The Lord knows.
Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go fighting against the Spring.’” Mr.
Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured.
“‘War not with the May’ would render a correct meaning.” “The point is, we have warred with it.
Look.” He pointed to the Val d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them.
Do you suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man?
But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.” No one encouraged him to talk.
Presently Mr.
Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain.
It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before.
He had ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending.
Standing there, he had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work.
But where exactly had he stood?
That was the question which Mr.
Eager hoped to solve now.
And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups.
Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask.
In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio Baldovinetti, but the drive.
Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was very sorry that she had asked him.
She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him.
Mr. Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish.
“Oh, but I shall die!
Of course it was the railway!” She could not control her mirth.
“He is the image of a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.” “Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion.
“Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—” “I can’t stop.
Let me go my wicked way.
A porter—” “Eleanor!” “I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy.
“The Emersons won’t hear, and they wouldn’t mind if they did.” Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly.
“Pouf!
Wouf!
You naughty girl!
Go away!” “Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr.
Eager, I’m sure.” “I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.” “Mr.
Eager will be offended.
It is your party.” “Please, I’d rather stop here with you.” “No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish.
“It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.
Miss Lucy, you are to go.
We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.” The girl was stubborn.
As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.
Such a one was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte.
She wished she had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Oh, I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here.” Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm.
Lucy did not look at the view either.
She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish.
“Observe my foresight.” With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy.
The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
If I do feel it coming on I shall stand.
Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist.
“Here we are, all settled delightfully.
Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown.
Sit down, dear; you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared her throat.
“Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold.
It’s the tiniest cough, and I have had it three days.
It’s nothing to do with sitting here at all.” There was only one way of treating the situation.
At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr.
Eager, vanquished by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.
The miscreant, a bony young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up.
Of course he knew where.
Not so far either.
His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon.
He should just think he did know where.
He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary.
What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good?
Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings!
He showed her his cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?” She was correct as usual.
He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her.
Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.
Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
She thanked him with real pleasure.
In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
For the first time she felt the influence of Spring.
His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?” “Ma buoni uomini.” He bowed.
Certainly.
Good men first, violets afterwards.
They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker.
They were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces.
He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant boughs.
She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.
Not a step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?” There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.
The voice of Mr.
Eager?
He shrugged his shoulders.
An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge.
She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen.
The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
Light and beauty enveloped her.
She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.” She did not answer.
From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view, and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam.
But never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival.
For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.
He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves.
The bushes above them closed.
He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called, “Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.
What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was slow to discover.
Mr.
Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk.
Mr. Emerson, seeking his son, was told whereabouts to find him.
Mr. Beebe, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the return home.
There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment.
Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics.
Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise.
Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett.
Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager.
Mr. Emerson had lost George.
Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square.
Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable.
He climbed on to the box shivering, with his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather.
“Let us go immediately,” he told them.
“The signorino will walk.” “All the way?
He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently.
I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.
He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence.
He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.
He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also.
Not so these English.
They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents, but infinitely the least dangerous.
Once back in the town, he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more.
Of course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it.
But after all, what have we to do with taverns?
Real menace belongs to the drawing-room.
It was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun.
Lucy sat beside her; Mr.
Eager sat opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious.
They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together.
The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol.
There was a lightning flash, and Miss Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front.
At the next flash, Lucy screamed also.
Mr.
Eager addressed her professionally: “Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith.
If I might say so, there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements.
Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?” “No—of course—” “Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous.
The steel knives, the only articles which might attract the current, are in the other carriage.
And, in any case, we are infinitely safer than if we were walking.
Courage—courage and faith.” Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand.
At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles, gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr.
Eager!” called Mr. Beebe.
“We want your assistance.
Will you interpret for us?” “George!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way.
He may be killed.” “Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver is no help.
Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.” “He may be killed!” cried the old man.
“He may be killed!” “Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage.
“In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.” “What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr.
Eager know?” “Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing.
But—” she pointed at the driver—“_he_ knows everything.
Dearest, had we better?
Shall I?” She took out her purse.
“It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book, she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it.
As well this ending to his day as any.
But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road.
The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen.
If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt.
They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.
They descended from the carriages; they embraced each other.
It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them.
For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly.
In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike.
Miss Lavish calculated that, even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the accident.
Mr.
Eager mumbled a temperate prayer.
But the drivers, through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me.
Kiss me again.
Only you can understand me.
You warned me to be careful.
And I—I thought I was developing.” “Do not cry, dearest.
Take your time.” “I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse.
Once by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?” The thought disturbed her repentance.
As a matter of fact, the storm was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not.
One would always pray against that.” “He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that.
I simply slipped into those violets.
No, I want to be really truthful.
I am a little to blame.
I had silly thoughts.
The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.” “In a book?” “Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.” “And then?” “But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
Indeed, she had little more to learn.
With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her.
All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
“It is so hard to be absolutely truthful.” “Don’t be troubled, dearest.
Wait till you are calmer.
We will talk it over before bed-time in my room.” So they re-entered the city with hands clasped.
It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others.
The storm had ceased, and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son.
Mr. Beebe had regained good humour, and Mr.
Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish.
Charlotte alone she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening.
She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it.
All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be carefully laid before her cousin.
And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself.
I shan’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know what.” Miss Alan asked her to play.
She refused vehemently.
Music seemed to her the employment of a child.
She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own.
Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay.
In vain she tried to check, or at all events to accelerate, the tale.
It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach: “Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire.
Come into my room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.” With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the girl.
Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?” She was unprepared for the question.
It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything.
A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done?
A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.” The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door.
A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes.
She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?” “The driver?” “My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.” Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?” “I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.” “I, too, intend to judge him charitably.
But unfortunately I have met the type before.
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first?
Come here and listen to me.
I am only gathering it from his own remarks.
Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another?” “Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude.
There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish.
But we are no farther on with our question.
What do you propose to do?” An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it.
But—as you said—it is my affair.
Mine and his.” “And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?” “Certainly not.
There would be no difficulty.
Whatever you ask him he answers, yes or no; then it is over.
I have been frightened of him.
But now I am not one little bit.” “But we fear him for you, dear.
You are so young and inexperienced, you have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round.
This afternoon, for example, if I had not arrived, what would have happened?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?” “I hadn’t time to think.
You came.” “Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?” “I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off.
She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett.
“You will be seen from the road.” Lucy obeyed.
She was in her cousin’s power.
She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started.
Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man!
We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless.
There is Mr.
Eager, but you do not trust him.
Oh, for your brother!
He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.
Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead.
There are still left some men who can reverence woman.” As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and ranged them upon the pin cushion.
Then she blew into her gloves and said: “It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.” “What train?” “The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?” “At eight.” “Signora Bertolini would be upset.” “We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.” “I expect she will.
However, we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses’ hotel.
Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?” “Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained motionless and silent.
To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome.
Lucy, when admonished, began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte, who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly.
She knelt down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.
But she was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her, but needed her to love.
For it was in ominous tones that she said, after a long pause: “Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?” Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant.
Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: “Charlotte dear, what do you mean?
As if I have anything to forgive!” “You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
I know well how much I vex you at every turn.” “But no—” Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged martyr.
“Ah, but yes!
I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped.
I might have known it would not do.
You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you.
I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.” “Please—” “My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and were often able to leave me at home.
I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary.
You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.” “You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other, heart and soul.
They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own.
“Failed to make you happy; failed in my duty to your mother.
She has been so generous to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.” “But mother will understand.
It is not your fault, this trouble, and it isn’t a disaster either.” “It is my fault, it is a disaster.
She will never forgive me, and rightly.
For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish?” “Every right.” “When I was here for your sake?
If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you.
Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.” Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence.
There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.” The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her.
But in case she should blame you in any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to.
I will never speak of it either to her or to any one.” Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.
Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background.
George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually.
At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since, it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent.
She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed, for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love.
Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters.
Before she reached them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle.
Thus it was that, though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers.
She was still dressed.
It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved.
At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said: “I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.” Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr. Emerson.” His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true.
It can’t all be true.
I want not to be muddled.
I want to grow older quickly.” Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear.
You need all the rest you can get.” In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun.
They were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied.
A poet—none was present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room.
One—a boy of nineteen—was studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano.
From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him what she had written.
And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother.
“I tell you I’m getting fairly sick.” “For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
“Time they did.” “I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.” “It’s his third go, isn’t it?” “Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.” “I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy.
I don’t know how girls manage things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.” “Do you indeed, dear?
How interesting!” “I feel—never mind.” He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse.
I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’” “Yes, mother, you told me.
A jolly good letter.” “I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.
But—’” She stopped reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all.
He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth.
When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.” “Nor me.” “You?” Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?” “He asked me for my permission also.” She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir.
“Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?
What ever did you say?” “I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’” “What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come.
There they still are!” “I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.” “Peeping like that!
Can’t I look out of my own window?” But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves.
For a brief space they were silent.
Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave a nervous gulp.
“Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy.
He practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her?
And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.” “I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.” “I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth.
“There!
Fly into a stew!
I can’t help it—had to say it.
I had to say no.
He ought never to have asked me.” “Ridiculous child!” cried his mother.
“You think you’re so holy and truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit.
Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say?
I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?” “Oh, do keep quiet, mother!
I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.
I tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right.
But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.” “No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the subject, “I shall not keep quiet.
You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.” “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
“I only let out I didn’t like him.
I don’t hate him, but I don’t like him.
What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.” He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“I know his mother; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick the piano!
He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained dissatisfied.
She added: “And he has beautiful manners.” “I liked him till just now.
I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.” “Mr.
Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest.
“I don’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in.” “You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means.
He said: ‘Mr.
Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he meant.
He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking.
Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.” “You never can, dear.
But I can.
You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.” The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it.
But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust.
Cecil praised one too much for being athletic.
Was that it?
Cecil made one talk in one’s own way.
This tired one.
Was that it?
And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow’s cap.
Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself.
He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother.
“‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light.
She keeps that flat abominably—” “Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?” “Don’t interrupt so foolishly.
Where was I?
Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing.
I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything.
But I do not know—’” “Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation.
He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles.
Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds.
But it was transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald.
Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described.
He was medieval.
Like a Gothic statue.
Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism.
A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant.
And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!” “I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals.
They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.
We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the furniture.
“This is indeed a joyous day!
I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy.” “I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat.
She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis.
Then she saw her brother’s face.
Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?” Cecil suggested.
“And I’d stop here and tell my mother.” “We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.” They passed into the sunlight.
Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and descend out of sight by the steps.
They would descend—he knew their ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed, until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical.
He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s.
That day she had seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel.
But Italy worked some marvel in her.
It gave her light, and—which he held more precious—it gave her shadow.
Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence.
She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness.
Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other.
It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the same to him as before.
Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language.
She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her.
He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
The things that really mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy.
His mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he moved to the writing table.
There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many erasures.
He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.
With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table.
The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter.
He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about it none the less.
It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected.
“I represent all that he despises.
Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?” The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
“Mr.
Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse.
Do you suppose that I shall get it?” “I should say so.
Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.” “Pfui!” “I know,” said Cecil.
“I know.
I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.” For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip.
Isn’t this news?” “News?
I don’t understand you,” said Cecil.
“News?” Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field.
He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!” “Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself.
Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen!
Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
But his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question!
To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church!
I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.” “I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly.
“I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board.
Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the right names.
I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery.
It is very remiss of me.
Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.” Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?” “I have no profession,” said Cecil.
“It is another example of my decadence.
My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
I know I ought to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.” “You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe.
“It is a wonderful opportunity, the possession of leisure.” His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally.
He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve.
I daren’t face the healthy person—for example, Freddy Honeychurch.” “Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?” “Admirable.
The sort who has made England what she is.” Cecil wondered at himself.
Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly contrary?
He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea before evening service.” “I suppose Anne never told them you were here.
In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives.
The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?” “I know the faults of Mary.
She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.” “The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small.” They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many.
No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.” “She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree.
At present she has none.” “At present?” “I’m not cynical.
I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle.
Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.” Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?” “Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps.
Oh, I forgot; of course, you knew her before.
No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.” “In what way?” Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string.
Picture number two: the string breaks.” The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically.
At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?” “No.
I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.” “It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst.
He cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken?
What do you mean?” “I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.” The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize.
I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners.
Was this the reception his action would get from the world?
Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly.
“I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.” “Not that.
But you ought to have stopped me.
I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes.
Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with any one; certainly not with you.” “You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?” Mr. Beebe pulled himself together.
Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions.
He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet.
I foresaw at Florence that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended.
I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio.
He did not omit to do so.
“She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her.” “Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?” Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march.
Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried.
He looked at Lucy.
In her presence he could not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.
I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great and small.
I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and mother.
And now I want my tea.” “You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted.
“How dare you be serious at Windy Corner?” He took his tone from her.
There was no more heavy beneficence, no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures.
None of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe.
Away from it, in the solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical.
But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious.
It has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart.
The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed.
Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel sentimental.
Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.
If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true.
Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them greatly.
They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door.
Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance.
Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as a mother-in-law.
As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him.
People congratulated Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid.
They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with the dowagers.
When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?” “I suppose so.
Mother, would it be?” “Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and said: “To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.” “I am so sorry that you were stranded.” “Not that, but the congratulations.
It is so disgusting, the way an engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment.
All those old women smirking!” “One has to go through it, I suppose.
They won’t notice us so much next time.” “But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong.
An engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and should be treated as such.” Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially correct.
The spirit of the generations had smiled through them, rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth.
To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite different—personal love.
Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said.
“Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?” “I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public.
The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic.
Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato.” “Inglese Italianato?” “E un diavolo incarnato!
You know the proverb?” She did not.
Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother.
But Cecil, since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.” “We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?” “It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in, or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?” She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert.
“I don’t see any difference.
Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same place.” “We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap.
“This is me.
That’s Windy Corner.
The rest of the pattern is the other people.
Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.” She leant placidly back.
Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and that’s Mr. Beebe.” “A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.” Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect what they meant.
She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried.
“I consider him far above the average.
I only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful ones, is Mr.
Eager, the English chaplain at Florence.
He was truly insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate.
He was a snob, and so conceited, and he did say such unkind things.” “What sort of things?” “There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife.” “Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing.
Mr.
Eager would never come to the point.
He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.” “Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander?
It was, I believe, chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped.
People pretended he was vulgar, but he certainly wasn’t that.” “Poor old man!
What was his name?” “Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr.
Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know.
I hate him.
I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto.
I hate him.
Nothing can hide a petty nature.
I _hate_ him.” “My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“You’ll blow my head off!
Whatever is there to shout over?
I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen.” He smiled.
There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s moral outburst over Mr.
Eager.
It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine.
He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not in muscular rant.
But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive.
After a moment, he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval.
He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.
He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.
The outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact.
Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I feel I could never live out of it.
When I’m in the country I feel the same about the country.
After all, I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who live amongst them must be the best.
It’s true that in nine cases out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything.
The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions.
Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town.
Do you feel that, Mrs. Honeychurch?” Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled.
She had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either.
Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics.
It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?” “‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?” “Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled spire.
Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church.
In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages.
Some great mansions were at hand, but they were hidden in the trees.
The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement, having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals.
“Albert” was inhabited.
His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace.
“Cissie” was to let.
Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically.
“Summer Street will never be the same again.” As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry.
Now we shall know.
Sir Harry, pull those things down at once!” Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I meant to.
I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss Flack.” “Am I not always right?
She ought to have gone before the contract was signed.
Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s time?” “But what can I do?” He lowered his voice.
“An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden.” “Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully.
He had had full warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory.
He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt.
Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper.
He ventured to differ, however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration.
Sir Harry hinted that a column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin.
He built his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage.
He had failed in his duties to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy landlord.
But it is such an awkward size.
It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.” Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them.
The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously.
“It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.” “Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly.
“That is exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong type of people.
The train service has improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind.
And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?” “Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate.
She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea.
How would you like spinsters?” “My dear Lucy, it would be splendid.
Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.
I heard from them last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.
I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people.
Mr. Beebe knows them, too.
May I tell them to write to you?” “Indeed you may!” he cried.
“Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
How delightful it is!
Extra facilities—please tell them they shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees.
Oh, the agents!
The appalling people they have sent me!
One woman, when I wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance.
As if one cares about that!
And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable.
And oh, the deceit!
I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week.
The deceit of the most promising people.
My dear Lucy, the deceit!” She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all.
I know the type.
Preserve me from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy.
It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down.” “I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very sad thing.” “The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil.
“I haven’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.” “Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.” “It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied.
“I oughtn’t to come with my troubles to young people.
But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no real help.” “Then may I write to my Misses Alan?” “Please!” But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed: “Beware!
They are certain to have canaries.
Sir Harry, beware of canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come.
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.” “Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
If they get drunk, there’s an end of them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off.
If they’re vulgar, they somehow keep it to themselves.
It doesn’t spread so.
Give me a man—of course, provided he’s clean.” Sir Harry blushed.
Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex.
Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction.
He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself.
She was delighted.
Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house.
Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?” “Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.
He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha!
young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!” “I can’t help it.
It would be wrong not to loathe that man.” “He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.” “No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life.
In London he would keep his place.
He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife would give brainless dinner parties.
But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and every one—even your mother—is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt discouraged.
“I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.” “It matters supremely.
Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!
How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
with his bald head and retreating chin!
But let’s forget him.” This Lucy was glad enough to do.
If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape?
For instance, Freddy.
Freddy was neither clever, nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”?
And what would she reply?
Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety enough.
She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps, during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them.
Summer Street lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
“Why is it, Lucy, that you always say the road?
Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?” “Haven’t I?
The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with me in a room.” “A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes.
Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road.
Never in the real country like this.” “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
I have never felt anything of the sort.
You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.” “I don’t know that you aren’t.
I connect you with a view—a certain type of view.
Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?” She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing: “Do you know that you’re right?
I do.
I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room.
How funny!” To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray?
With no view?” “Yes, with no view, I fancy.
Why not?” “I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open air.” She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?” As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees.
She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!” “Why do you call it that?” “I can’t remember why.
I suppose it comes out of some book.
It’s only a puddle now, but you see that stream going through it?
Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful.
Then Freddy used to bathe there.
He is very fond of it.” “And you?” He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed here, too, till I was found out.
Then there was a row.” At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of prudishness within him.
But now?
with his momentary cult of the fresh air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity.
He looked at her as she stood by the pool’s edge.
She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?” “Charlotte,” she murmured.
“She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.” “Poor girl!” She smiled gravely.
A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
“What, Cecil?” “Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me—” He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed.
His courage had gone.
“Yes?” “Up to now I have never kissed you.” She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?” “Of course, you may, Cecil.
You might before.
I can’t run at you, you know.” At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities.
Her reply was inadequate.
She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil.
As he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them.
Such was the embrace.
He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure.
Passion should believe itself irresistible.
It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young man behind the counter would have done?
He recast the scene.
Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness.
For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation.
He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts.
At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.” “What name?” “The old man’s.” “What old man?” “That old man I told you about.
The one Mr.
Eager was so unkind to.” He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had.
Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to.
Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself.
Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs.
Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy.
He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility.
“I cannot think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter.
When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.
The best obtainable.
Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles.
A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia.
Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes.
In this circle, one thought, married, and died.
Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills.
But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high.
You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you.
She returned with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation.
He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad.
He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
Nor did he realize a more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her.
A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved.
For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.” “But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe.
“I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably.
They are coming.
I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried.
“Just because they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing.
And poor Lucy—serve her right—worn to a shadow.” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court.
Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn.
When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring.
“If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count.
I told you not Saturn.” “Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.” “Saturn doesn’t bounce.” “Saturn bounces enough.” “No, he doesn’t.” “Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.” “Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in.
That’s right, Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over the shins!” Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness.
Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt.
He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
But he hated the physical violence of the young.
How right it was!
Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.” “That wasn’t the name—” Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.” “Nonsense, Freddy!
You know nothing about it.” “Nonsense yourself!
I’ve this minute seen him.
He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem!
ahem!
I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’ and slapped him on the back.” “Exactly.
The Miss Alans?” “Rather not.
More like Anderson.” “Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed.
“Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right?
I _said_ don’t interfere with Cissie Villa.
I’m always right.
I’m quite uneasy at being always right so often.” “It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s.
Freddy doesn’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.” “Yes, I do.
I’ve got it.
Emerson.” “What name?” “Emerson.
I’ll bet you anything you like.” “What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly.
“I wish I had never bothered over it at all.” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky.
Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy?
Do you know what Emersons they are?” “I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was democratic.
Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person.
All right, Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother’s a snob.
But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s affectation to pretend there isn’t.” “Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways.
Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man.
Pray, does that satisfy you?” “Oh, yes,” he grumbled.
“And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety.” “_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly.
“Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.” “But has Cecil—” “Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’” She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much.
While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl.
She might well “screech” when she heard that it came partly from her lover.
Mr. Vyse was a tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people.
The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
He diverted it as follows: “The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean?
No, I don’t suppose it will prove to be them.
It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse’s.
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people!
The queerest people!
For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets.
They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa.
Poor little ladies!
So shocked and so pleased.
It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories.
‘My dear sister loves flowers,’ it began.
They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult.
Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets.” “Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister’s face was very red.
She could not recover herself.
Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature—pessimism, et cetera.
Our special joy was the father—such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.
He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Lucy, don’t desert us—go on playing bumble-puppy.
Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place.
That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being there.
Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop?
By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time.” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer.
He suggested that his hostess was mistaken.
At the hint of opposition she warmed.
She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told.
The name escaped her.
What was the name?
Oh, what was the name?
She clasped her knees for the name.
Something in Thackeray.
She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely.
“Don’t be silly.
You always overdo it when you play.” As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
Hitherto truth had come to her naturally.
She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely truthful?
Well, at all events, she must not tell lies.
She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame.
A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.
“Cecil!” “Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window.
He seemed in high spirits.
“I was hoping you’d come.
I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse.
George Meredith’s right—the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa.
Don’t be angry!
Don’t be angry!
You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.” He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said.
“Freddy has told us.
Naughty Cecil!
I suppose I must forgive you.
Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have nice friends of yours.
But you oughtn’t to tease one so.” “Friends of mine?” he laughed.
“But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was.
“Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week.” “What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously.
“I don’t quite understand.” “In the Umbrian Room.
Absolute strangers.
They were admiring Luca Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly.
However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not a little.
They had been to Italy.” “But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends.
I thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—” “Cecil!
No, it’s not fair.
I’ve probably met them before—” He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair.
Anything is fair that punishes a snob.
That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good.
Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with me.
There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things.
I believe in democracy—” “No, you don’t,” she snapped.
“You don’t know what the word means.” He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque.
“No, you don’t!” Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil.
I blame you—I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous.
You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense?
I consider it most disloyal of you.” She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness.
As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded.
He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally.
He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent.
In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse.
His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch.
Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement, met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned.
The Miss Alans were duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held responsible for the failure.
Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived.
Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood.
And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood.
Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood.
But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done.
She was glad that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative.
He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy.
At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do!
I don’t know what I should do without you.” Several days passed.
Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett.
A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not corresponded since they parted in August.
The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased amazingly.
For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical.
Charlotte, unselfish in the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue their tour.
Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs.
Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly.
Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS, “_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA, “I have news of you at last!
Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome.
Puncturing her tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out.
He said his father had just taken the house.
He _said_ he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (?).
He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea.
Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him to enter the house, etc.
That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you have told them already.
Mr. Vyse is so sensitive.
I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome.
I am very sorry about it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me, “Your anxious and loving cousin, “CHARLOTTE.” Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows: “BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE, “Many thanks for your warning.
When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she would blame you for not being always with me.
I have kept that promise, and cannot possibly tell her now.
I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself.
She should have tried at the Rectory.
I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage.
You must see that it would be too absurd.
If the Emersons heard I had complained of them, they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they are not.
I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy Corner at all, but here.
Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your envelope again.
No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately, “L.
M. HONEYCHURCH.” Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not.
Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at?
Miss Bartlett suggested the former.
Perhaps she was right.
It had become a great thing now.
Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago.
She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school.
But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.
It did her no harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors.
The weather was cool, and it did her no harm.
In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people.
The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.
One was tired of everything, it seemed.
One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter.
In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann.
“Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the querulous beauty of the music had died.
She shook her head and played Schumann again.
The melody rose, unprofitably magical.
It broke; it was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave.
The sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of the audience throb.
Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s, had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among many people.
The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.” “Her music always was wonderful.” “Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean.
She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.” “Italy has done it.” “Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her.
“It is just possible.
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.” “But her music!” he exclaimed.
“The style of her!
How she kept to Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schumann was right for this evening.
Schumann was the thing.
Do you know, mother, I shall have our children educated just like Lucy.
Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then—not till then—let them come to London.
I don’t believe in these London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.” “Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s room.
Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself.
She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.” “Bad dreams?” “Just dreams.” The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You should have heard us talking about you, dear.
He admires you more than ever.
Dream of that.” Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed.
Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed.
As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.” “M’m.” “They might amuse you.” Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe.
“They are worth it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
“Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!” “I’ve brought someone to see you.” “I’ll be down in a minute.” The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered.
“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment.
What have they got?
Byron.
Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad.
Never heard of it.
The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it.
Gibbon.
Hullo!
dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.” “Mr.
Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.” “I know.
Isn’t it jolly?
I like that.
I’m certain that’s the old man’s doing.” “How very odd of him!” “Surely you agree?” But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.” “The same as Lucy’s got.” “Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?” “She came back yesterday.” “I suppose she had a good time?” “Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book.
“She and Cecil are thicker than ever.” “That’s good hearing.” “I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.” Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks.
She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books.
Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
Cecil says—” “What on earth are those people doing upstairs?
Emerson—we think we’ll come another time.” George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.” Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face wanted washing.
At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe.” “Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do?
how d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard.
But I’m afraid it will only act between men.
Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How do you do?
Come and have a bathe’?
And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.” “I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.
I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.” “We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you place in the past, is really yet to come.
We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.” Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead.
We despise the body less than women do.
But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.” “I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once.
But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
It is our heritage.” “Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.” “How do you do?
Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty.
I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He has been most kind.
He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
Ah, this wind!
You do well to bathe.
Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!” “Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy.
“I must—that is to say, I have to—have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.” “_Call_, my lad?
Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
Call on your grandmother!
Listen to the wind among the pines!
Yours is a glorious country.” Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr.
Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval.
It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, George.
Why do you dawdle talking?
Bring them back to tea.
Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his office.
I can’t believe he’s well.” George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him.
“It is only a pond, don’t you know.
I dare say you are used to something better.” “Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.” Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
How glorious it was!
For a little time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
He spoke of Florence.
George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse!
Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?” “I did not.
Miss Lavish told me.” “When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of Coincidence.’” No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.” To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is.
I have reflected.
It is Fate.
Everything is Fate.
We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart.
The twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—” “You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman.
“Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
Don’t say, ‘I didn’t do this,’ for you did it, ten to one.
Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?” “Italy.” “And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?” “National Gallery.” “Looking at Italian art.
There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.” “It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George.
“But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.” Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is still to write.” Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that you have come.” Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond.
I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe.
“No apologies are necessary for the pond.” George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid?
I love willow-herb in seed.
What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
Very charming, very charming.” “Mr.
Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George.
Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
It was necessary to use his muscles.
It was necessary to keep clean.
Mr. Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful, water’s simply ripping.” “Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful.
Mr. Beebe, do.” “Apooshoo, kouf.” Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
How glorious it was!
The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Götterdämmerung.
But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
They began to play.
Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
A little deferentially, they splashed George.
He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: “No.
We are what matters.
Without us shall no enterprise begin.
To us shall all flesh turn in the end.” “A try!
A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a kick.
“Goal!” “Goal!” “Pass!” “Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat!
No, that’s enough, Freddy.
Dress now.
No, I say!” But the two young men were delirious.
Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
“Hi!
Steady on!
I see people coming you fellows!” Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi!
hi!
_Ladies!_” Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
Still, they did not hear Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Whoever were those unfortunate people?
Oh, dears, look away!
And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?” “Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
Cecil, Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—” No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently “minded.” “I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.” “This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.” They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
“I can’t be trodden on, can I?” “Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you!
What miserable management!
Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?” “Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and if another fellow—” “Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
Come, Lucy.” They turned.
“Oh, look—don’t look!
Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
How unfortunate again—” For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken.
“I’ve swallowed a pollywog.
It wriggleth in my tummy.
I shall die—Emerson you beast, you’ve got on my bags.” “Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
“And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.” “Mother, do come away,” said Lucy.
“Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.” “Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed.
Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called: “Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
Hullo!” “Bow, Lucy; better bow.
Whoever is it?
I shall bow.” Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away.
On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for youth.
Chapter XIII How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview!
But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume.
Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent.
She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life.
A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much.
“I will bow,” she had thought.
“I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom?
To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.
It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.
Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and he did not want to be seen.
He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside.
He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done.
Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock.
Miss Bartlett, indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory.
Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with Cecil?” The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.” “Perhaps he’s tired.” Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.” “I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.” “Cecil has told you to think so.
You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.” “Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?” “Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?” “Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble ahead.
“It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him sometimes seem—” “Oh, rubbish!
If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother!
I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!” “Not in that way.
At times I could wring her neck.
But not in that way.
No.
It is the same with Cecil all over.” “By-the-by—I never told you.
I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London.” This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me.
No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.” “I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to.
But he does not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.” “Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?” “You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.” “Then why didn’t he leave the room?
Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone’s pleasure?” “We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy.
Something had enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form.
The two civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes.
Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he had succeeded.
And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother—” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
Go.” She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window.
It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.
Now, as in the winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes.
One connected the landing window with depression.
No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly.
And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.
She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.” “My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been!
You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public.
It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else.
Do be more careful.
You forget the place is growing half suburban.” “I say, is anything on to-morrow week?” “Not that I know of.” “Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.” “Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.” “What’s wrong with the court?
They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered new balls.” “I meant _it’s_ better not.
I really mean it.” He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper.
Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans.
Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making!
I have something to say to you.
Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes.
I really can’t stop.
I must dress too.” “How’s Charlotte?” “All right.” “Lucy!” The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?” “Her _what?_” “Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?” “I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly.
“I shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.” Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out.
She did not.
She said: “Come here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life.
It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil.
Cecil despised their methods—perhaps rightly.
At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven.
Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
Then Freddy said: “Lucy, what’s Emerson like?” “I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?” “Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.” “He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly.
I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.” “Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter.” “One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie.
“Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.” “Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.” “She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily.
The remark was a happy one, for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print.
Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath.
But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness.
There were too many ghosts about.
The original ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr.
Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes.
It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s.
How is she?” “I tore the thing up.” “Didn’t she say how she was?
How does she sound?
Cheerful?” “Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.” “Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler.
I know myself how water preys upon one’s mind.
I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the meat.” Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish.
I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long.” It was more than her nerves could stand.
And she could not protest violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded.
“It’s impossible.
We can’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is.
Freddy’s got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare.
It simply can’t be done.” “Nonsense!
It can.” “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
Not otherwise.” “Minnie can sleep with you.” “I won’t have her.” “Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.” “Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy.
“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.” “No, I don’t.
And no more does Cecil.
She gets on our nerves.
You haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good.
So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come.” “Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two.
You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers.
You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.” Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike,” put in Freddy.
“She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.” “I know, dear.
She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return.” But Lucy hardened her heart.
It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She had tried herself too often and too recently.
One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth.
She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother.
I don’t like Charlotte.
I admit it’s horrid of me.” “From your own account, you told her as much.” “Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
She flurried—” The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the places she had known as a child.
The Sacred Lake would never be the same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner.
How would she fight against ghosts?
For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care for eggs.
I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.” Cecil frowned again.
Oh, these Honeychurches!
Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact.
“May me and Lucy get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.” Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room—something with no view, anything.
Her love to Lucy.
And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
She never gazed inwards.
If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
She was nervous at night.
When she talked to George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
Once she had suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious.
Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
She loved Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
Standing between Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his crudities in time.
I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.” Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits.
He laughs more.” “Yes,” replied the clergyman.
“He is waking up.” That was all.
But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs. Honeychurch drove to meet her.
She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“I have upset everything.
Bursting in on young people!
But I insist on paying for my cab up.
Grant that, at any rate.” “Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.” “I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather.
Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.” Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
Only sovereigns and pennies.
Could any one give her change?
Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But who am I to give the sovereign to?” “Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.” Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid.
A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
I should practically be robbing the one who lost.” “Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil.
“So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.” “Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
“How is that, Mr. Vyse?” “Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab.
Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.” Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy.
He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
“I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid.” “Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.” “But I don’t see—” They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you.
I’m done.
I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me.
Ow!
What about Mr. Floyd’s ten shillings?
Ow!
No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.” “I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
“Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
A shilling was it?
Can any one give me change for half a crown?” “I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign.
No, give me up that sovereign.
I’ll get Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning.” “Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?” “No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
“Let me see—a sovereign’s worth of silver.” She escaped into the kitchen.
Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were too uncanny.
It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t.
Here is your money—all shillings, except two half-crowns.
Would you count it?
You can settle your debt nicely now.” Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source.” “Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle.
“George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?” Miss Bartlett considered.
“For instance, the driver.
I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.” Lucy shuddered a little.
“We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren’t careful.
How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?” “We must think of every possibility.” “Oh, it’s all right.” “Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows.
In fact, he is certain to know.” “I don’t care if he does.
I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.” “To contradict it?” “No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best.
Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
Ladies are certainly different.” “Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully.
“You kind, anxious thing.
What _would_ you have me do?
First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say, ‘Tell’.
Which is it to be?
Quick!” Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest.
I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
You will never forgive me.” “Shall we go out, then.
They will smash all the china if we don’t.” For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again.
Have you seen the young one yet?” “Yes, I have.” “What happened?” “We met at the Rectory.” “What line is he taking up?” “No line.
He talked about Italy, like any other person.
It is really all right.
What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way.
He really won’t be any nuisance, Charlotte.” “Once a cad, always a cad.
That is my poor opinion.” Lucy paused.
“Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
It was a new one from Smith’s library.
Her mother must have returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
I don’t think we ought to blame him very much.
It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
He has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into tears.
He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big railways—not a porter!
and runs down to his father for week-ends.
Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
There!
Now for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm.
“Suppose we don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.” Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
Explanations took place, and in the midst of them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain.
Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most of the days of that year.
In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold.
Up on the heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.
Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path.
From the house came incoherent sounds, as of females preparing for worship.
“The men say they won’t go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her, no nonsense”—“Anne!
Mary!
Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine.
Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously.
The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender shadow.
But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window.
Her new cerise dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan.
At her throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an engagement ring.
Her eyes are bent to the Weald.
She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.
In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills.
“Lucy!
Lucy!
What’s that book?
Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?” “It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.” “But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.” Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a Loggia.
She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up.
It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil had said, “What!
you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?” She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.
I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child?
Minnie!
That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!)
Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late.
Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse, never the carriage.
“Where’s Charlotte?
Run up and hurry her.
Why is she so long?
She had nothing to do.
She never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses!
Minnie!” Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting.
As usual, she didn’t see why.
Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men?
The young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words.
Mrs. Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but sovereigns and half crowns.
Could any one give me—” “Yes, easily.
Jump in.
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock!
You put us all to shame.” “If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully.
She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse.
The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
“Good-bye!
Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering.
On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation.
He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.
All that he said on this subject pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church.
There was a line of carriages down the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa.
To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother.
“Unless the young man considers that he knows me already.” He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally.
Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how glad he was that she was going to be married.
She said yes, she was glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice; she had never known him offended before.
He added: “We find, though, that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing.
I am very much upset about it.” “I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,” said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further.
“He thought we should be artistic.
He is disappointed.” “And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up.
What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly.
She must avoid censuring Cecil.
For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned, though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says.
He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall.
Yet it does seem so unkind.” “There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“That’s exactly what I say.
Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?” “There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,” he continued in measured tones.
“We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.
Choose a place where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!” “Eh—?” “I see you’re going to be clever.
I hope you didn’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy.” George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
“He behaved that way to me.
It is his philosophy.
Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first.” “What _do_ you mean?
No, never mind what you mean.
Don’t explain.
He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
Do you play tennis?
Do you mind tennis on Sunday—?” “George mind tennis on Sunday!
George, after his education, distinguish between Sunday—” “Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.
No more do I. That’s settled.
Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased.” He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans.” “I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck.
The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the morning sun?
She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.” “Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady.
Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow.
It was the pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow.
Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered.
He said: “I—I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house.
Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them.
“George has been in such good spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.” Lucy caught her cousin’s eye.
Something in its mute appeal made her reckless.
“Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven.
Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy.
All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things.
It was not an exploit.
He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her hand to her cheek.
“He does not love me.
No.
How terrible if he did!
But he has not told.
He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right.
It’s a secret between us two for ever.
Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room.
The secret, big or little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world.
Thus she interpreted her joy.
She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so safe.
As he helped her out of the carriage, she said: “The Emersons have been so nice.
George Emerson has improved enormously.” “How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them, and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth.
For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected.
He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are.
George Emerson is coming up this afternoon.
He is a most interesting man to talk to.
Only don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks.
Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal.
Generally Lucy was depressed at meals.
Some one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will not last, this cheerfulness.
In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee.
Her mother would always sit there, her brother here.
The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would never be hidden behind the western hills.
After luncheon they asked her to play.
She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.
Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.” She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round.
There George was.
He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
Cecil should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson.
Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.
She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano.
“I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.” “Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil.
“I will not spoil the set.” He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil.
I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s Emerson.” George corrected him: “I am not bad.” One looked down one’s nose at this.
“Then certainly I won’t play,” said Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse.
You had much better not play.
Much better not.” Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would play.
“I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall back on Lucy.
There is no other way out of it.
Lucy, go and change your frock.” Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature.
She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon.
As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner.
She liked music, but how much better tennis seemed.
How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms.
Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child.
George served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
The hills stood out above its radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara.
She might be forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her.
He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others.
He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke.
When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.” “What fun, Cecil!
Read away.
Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!” “Do you mind being beaten?” She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a splendid player, though.
The light was behind you, and it was in my eyes.” “I never said I was.” “Why, you did!” “You didn’t attend.” “You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house.
We all exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.” “‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset.
Leonora was speeding—’” Lucy interrupted.
“Leonora?
Is Leonora the heroine?
Who’s the book by?” “Joseph Emery Prank.
‘Sunset.
Leonora speeding across the square.
Pray the saints she might not arrive too late.
Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it now—’” Lucy burst into laughter.
“‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed!
Why it’s Miss Lavish!
It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under somebody else’s name.” “Who may Miss Lavish be?” “Oh, a dreadful person—Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?” Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up.
“Of course I do.
I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street.
It was she who told me that you lived here.” “Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean something else.
She watched his head, which was almost resting against her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening.
“No wonder the novel’s bad,” she added.
“I never liked Miss Lavish.
But I suppose one ought to read it as one’s met her.” “All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature.
“Every one writes for money in these days.” “Oh, Cecil—!” “It is so.
I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow.
The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her.
She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?” “I never notice much difference in views.” “What do you mean?” “Because they’re all alike.
Because all that matters in them is distance and air.” “H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.” “I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up.
Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.” He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured.
“I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again.
I’m so sorry he’s not so well.” “No, he isn’t well.” “There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil.
“Also that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.” “Mr.
Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?” “None.
Why?” “You spoke of ‘us.’” “My mother, I was meaning.” Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!” “I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” “I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.
It is the first thing that I remember.” Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after tennis—he didn’t do.
He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.” “Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.” “No—read away.
I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud.
If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.” This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him.
It put their visitor in the position of a prig.
Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr.
Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book.
Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked.
But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning.
“Find me chapter two, if it isn’t bothering you.” Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.” She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.” He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone.
Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village.
The season was spring.’” Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose, for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read.
He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence, while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets.
All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’” Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use.
No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’” “This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last.
She thought a disaster was averted.
But when they entered the shrubbery it came.
The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring.
That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove.
Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I must write some letters,” and went up to her room.
Then she prepared for action.
Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty.
Perhaps there never is such a contest.
It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first aim was to defeat herself.
As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been.
Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him.
The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.
In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
“Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?” Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.
“There is a scene in it.
The hero and heroine make love.
Do you know about that?” “Dear—?” “Do you know about it, please?” she repeated.
“They are on a hillside, and Florence is in the distance.” “My good Lucia, I am all at sea.
I know nothing about it whatever.” “There are violets.
I cannot believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her?
I have thought before speaking; it _must_ be you.” “Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.” Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved.
“Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t put that in her book?” Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it.
Yes.” “Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” “So you did tell?” “I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of conversation—” “But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell mother?” “I will never forgive Eleanor.
She has betrayed my confidence.” “Why did you tell her, though?
This is a most serious thing.” Why does any one tell anything?
The question is eternal, and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response.
She had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again.
Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes?
Behind Cecil’s back as we were walking up the garden.” Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now?
Can you tell me?” “Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day.
Fancy if your prospects—” “I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word.
“I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.” It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince.
“However,” said the girl, despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done.
You have put me in a most awkward position.
How am I to get out of it?” Miss Bartlett could not think.
The days of her energy were over.
She was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that.
She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him?
I can’t tell mother now—owing to you.
Nor Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you.
I am caught up every way.
I think I shall go mad.
I have no one to help me.
That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.” Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing.
What’s to be _done?_ We women go maundering on.
What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?” “I always said he was a cad, dear.
Give me credit for that, at all events.
From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a bath.” “Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong!
We’ve both made a muddle of it.
George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he to be left unpunished, or isn’t he?
I want to know.” Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless.
Her own exposure had unnerved her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain.
She moved feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?” “Willingly would I move heaven and earth—” “I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously.
“Will you speak to him?
It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word.” “Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.” “It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture.
“No one will help me.
I will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below.
“Found the lost ball?
Good man!
Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you!
I admire you—” They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul.
Her anger faded at the sight of him.
Ah!
The Emersons were fine people in their way.
She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying: “Freddy has taken him into the dining-room.
The others are going down the garden.
Come.
Let us get this over quickly.
Come.
I want you in the room, of course.” “Lucy, do you mind doing it?” “How can you ask such a ridiculous question?” “Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand.
“I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded.
She remembered their last evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss Bartlett’s toque on the door.
She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time.
Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying.
“The jam’s jolly good.” George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room.
As she entered he stopped, and said: “No—nothing to eat.” “You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants.
Where’s mother?” “She’s started on her Sunday writing.
She’s in the drawing-room.” “That’s all right.
You go away.” He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table.
Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech.
She just said: “I can’t have it, Mr. Emerson.
I cannot even talk to you.
Go out of this house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door.
“I hate a row.
Go please.” “What—” “No discussion.” “But I can’t—” She shook her head.
“Go, please.
I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.” “You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t mean that you are going to marry that man?” The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her.
“You are merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse.
He’s only for an acquaintance.
He is for society and cultivated talk.
He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.” It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss—” “No, but have you ever?
He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.
It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.
I would never have let myself go.
But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters.
Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.
That is the man all over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find.
Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to settle whether you were shocked or no.
Cecil all over again.
He daren’t let a woman decide.
He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.
Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon.
Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’ because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control.
I’m not ashamed.
I don’t apologize.
But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you.
Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly?
But therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.” Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson.
Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.” And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality.
He said: “Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary.
“I’m the same kind of brute at bottom.
This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He thought.
“Yes—really in a better way.
I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards her.
“Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain.
I have cared for you since that man died.
I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun.
As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered.
I called.
I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.” “And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm.
“Does he not matter?
That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly?
A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?” He said: “It is our last chance.
I shall do all that I can.” And as if he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening.
“You wouldn’t stop us this second time if you understood,” he said.
“I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.” Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though demolishing some invisible obstacle.
She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
“It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really.
It is that love and youth matter intellectually.” In silence the two women watched him.
His last remark, they knew, was nonsense, but was he going after it or not?
Would not he, the cad, the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish?
No.
He was apparently content.
He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house.
Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!” Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet.
“Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the latter.
One more fuss through with you, Charlotte.
Many thanks.
I think, though, that this is the last.
My admirer will hardly trouble me again.” And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish: “Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it?
Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really.
It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.” “Let’s go down to them.” But, once in the open air, she paused.
Some emotion—pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring.
That something or other mattered intellectually?
A leaf, violently agitated, danced past her, while other leaves lay motionless.
That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy!
There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll hurry.” “Mr.
Emerson has had to go.” “What a nuisance!
That spoils the four.
I say, Cecil, do play, do, there’s a good chap.
It’s Floyd’s last day.
Do play tennis with us, just this once.” Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete.
As you well remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you.” The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes.
How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement.
Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered.
He had nothing to say.
He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things over.
We are too different.
I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.” It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—” “I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
“My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.” “I don’t understand you.
You aren’t like yourself.
You’re tired, Lucy.” “Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once.
“That is exactly like you.
You always think women don’t mean what they say.” “Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.” “What if I do?
It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth.
I can’t marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.” “You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches.
But give me a moment’s time.” He closed his eyes.
“You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.” It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
To bring on the crisis, she said: “There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.” “I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never could play.
I don’t understand a word you say.” “You can play well enough to make up a four.
I thought it abominably selfish of you.” “No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis.
Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
You talked of our wedding at lunch—at least, you let me talk.” “I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly.
“I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
Of course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.” She developed this position.
“Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted to be my husband?
I don’t think so.
You don’t like Freddy, nor my mother.
There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point.
They have to-day.
I see clearly.
I must speak.
That’s all.” “I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently.
“I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
It’s all too horrible.” “What’s the good of a scene?” “No good.
But surely I have a right to hear a little more.” He put down his glass and opened the window.
From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy or any one might be outside.” He obeyed.
“I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved me!” “I did not,” she said.
“I thought I did at first.
I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.” He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
She had counted on his being petty.
It would have made things easier for her.
By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently.
I dare say you are right not to.
But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.” “Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort who can’t know any one intimately.” A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that.
But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
It is that, more or less.
When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always protecting me.” Her voice swelled.
“I won’t be protected.
I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
To shield me is an insult.
Can’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
A woman’s place!
You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
That’s why I break off my engagement.
You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause.
Then Cecil said with great emotion: “It is true.” “True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word.
It is a revelation.
It is—I.” “Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.” He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true.
I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
You are even greater than I thought.” She withdrew a step.
“I’m not going to worry you.
You are far too good to me.
I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
I have never known you till this evening.
I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—” “What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance.
She cried: “If you think I am in love with some one else, you are very much mistaken.” “Of course I don’t think that.
You are not that kind, Lucy.” “Oh, yes, you do think it.
It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting, brutal!
As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.” He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past.
I shall never say it again.
You have taught me better.” She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity.
I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.” “All right, Cecil, that will do.
Don’t apologize to me.
It was my mistake.” “It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke.
“I must actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really am.
Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
Will you shake hands?” “Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
“Good-night, Cecil.
Good-bye.
That’s all right.
I’m sorry about it.
Thank you very much for your gentleness.” “Let me light your candle, shall I?” They went into the hall.
“Thank you.
Good-night again.
God bless you, Lucy!” “Good-bye, Cecil.” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry.
In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself.
She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within.
They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
As the years pass, they are censured.
Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one.
The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill.
On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy Corner,—he laughed.
The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.
The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road.
So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly.
Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.
One might laugh at the house, but one never shuddered.
Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip.
He had heard from the Miss Alans.
These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed their plans.
They were going to Greece instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter.
Of course, Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train.
But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.” Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her.
She would see the fun of it, and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty.
Though she was hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she could not play the piano as she did.
He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been understood.
This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been illustrated by facts.
Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.
Therefore it must be the horse, who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy.
They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs.
Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station.
They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it.
“Isn’t it wonderful?
Isn’t it romance?
Most certainly they will go to Constantinople.
They are taken in a snare that cannot fail.
They will end by going round the world.” Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious!
I never notice it in you young people; you do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing.
‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn!
No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans.
They want the Pension Keats.” “I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you any matches?” “I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?” “Never.” “Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit.
I haven’t been to Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my friends going.
It is altogether too big for our little lot.
Don’t you think so?
Italy is just about as much as we can manage.
Italy is heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus.
All right, Freddy—I am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
“I was saying, if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience.
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me.
There the contrast is just as much as I can realize.
But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the victoria.” “You’re quite right,” said Cecil.
“Greece is not for our little lot”; and he got in.
Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really.
And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box, which had not been returned.
As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
Cecil’s hard hit.
Lucy won’t marry him.
If you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down.” “But when—” “Late last night.
I must go.” “Perhaps they won’t want me down there.” “No—go on.
Good-bye.” “Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart.
The house was again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata.
He hesitated a moment, but went down the garden as requested.
There he found a mournful company.
It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of assistance.
At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe?
Gracious what a mess everything is!
Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.” Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her.
“You have worried them as much as they can stand.
Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly.
I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.” “Oh, must you?
Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it.” Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about for, either in the house or out of it.” Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.
As they walked up the garden, the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother.
Or will she come with us?” “I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.” “They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has gone, and Freddy won’t play with me.
In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.” “Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur.
“Go and put on your boots.” He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart.
She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do?
Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive.
Would you come too?” “I don’t think I will, thank you.” “No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.” Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!” “Yes.” “I met them on the hill.
Your brother told me.” “Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed.
Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.” “Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have done the right thing.” “So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.” “I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.” “So does mother.
Mother minds dreadfully.” “I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.
It was really a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.” “Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he?
I gathered that he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.” “Boys are so odd.” Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor.
Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel.
Mr. Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action, so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan.
That was really what brought me over.
I thought it might amuse you all.” “How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.
After a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with “Going abroad?
When do they start?” “Next week, I gather.” “Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
Always complaisant, he put the letter away.
But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!
How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad!” “I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast!” She laughed heartily.
“Oh, delightful!
I wish they’d take me.” “Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel?
Perhaps George Emerson is right.
He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’” “Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople.
I have always longed to go to Constantinople.
Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?” Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm.
She had always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed.
He saw, to his surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends, after Cissie Villa.” “Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would give anything to go with them.” “Would your mother spare you again so soon?
You have scarcely been home three months.” “She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement.
“I simply _must_ go away.
I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
“Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away?
I didn’t realize at the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.” “You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—” “Yes, yes.
I knew you’d understand.” Mr. Beebe did not quite understand.
Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family?
Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her.
Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying.
He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down.” “I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all.
Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so masterful.
I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
He would improve me in places where I can’t be improved.
Cecil won’t let a woman decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t.
What nonsense I do talk!
But that is the kind of thing.” “It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you.
I do sympathize and agree most profoundly.
I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?” “But I must go somewhere!” she cried.
“I have been worrying all the morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with clenched fists, and repeated: “I must!
And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
You all think much too highly of me.
I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased.
“I must get away, ever so far.
I must know my own mind and where I want to go.” “Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out of the front-door.
He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource.
She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be.
I know all about it.
The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak.” Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett.
As he had put it to himself at Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
He assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter drop.” “I wonder.” “It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street.
It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at the present moment.” Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows.
Death is a strong word—surely too strong.
There was no question of tragedy.
He said: “Of course, Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she chooses.
Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.” “I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly.
“Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you.
One cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy.
A chance word to a chattering friend, and—” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
A rector lives in a web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he will regard them.
He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately?
I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish.
It is odd how we of that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another’s lives.
Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.
We must really give the Signora a testimonial.” And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern.
On the summit they paused.
The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue.
Summer was retreating.
The wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven.
The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery.
Mr. Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.” They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.
That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably.
Mr. Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces.
They would hand the child her food through the window.
Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past.
I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit.
She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her.
But the future.
Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again.
“I don’t know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.” Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.” To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you.
In it I spy Lucy’s salvation.” “Really.
Now, why?” “She wanted to leave Windy Corner.” “I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to say—selfish.” “It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire a change.” Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect misses.
Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced.
Perhaps she must have a change.
I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand these things.
But why need she go as far as Greece?” “You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner.
“Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?)
Why not Tunbridge Wells?
Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning.
I cannot help her.
I will say no more.
Perhaps I have already said too much.
I am not to talk.
I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.” Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance.
I know too well that I get on Lucy’s nerves.
Our tour was a failure.
She wanted to leave Florence, and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.” “Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe.
“I want your advice.” “Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to him, though familiar to Lucy.
“I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?” Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd woman really did know.
“She must not stop here a moment, and we must keep quiet till she goes.
I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already.
Only, Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone.
If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—” “Otherwise—?” “Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.” Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude.
The tavern sign—a beehive trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him.
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another man” that would have attracted a grosser mind.
He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form.
Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry.
His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.
“They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure.
In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity.
The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement.
Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the action of others.
The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey.
He conversed on indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants; Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could literature influence life?
Windy Corner glimmered.
In the garden, Mrs. Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly.
“This comes of putting off.
We might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece.
I don’t know what the world’s coming to.” “Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must.
Come up to the house and let’s talk it over.
Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?” “Mr.
Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.” “So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good.
Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone.
It was expensive and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed.
Nor would Charlotte have succeeded.
The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right.
It must be something I can’t understand.
Lucy!
Let’s tell her.
Lucy!” “She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said.
He opened the door, and heard the words of a song: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.” “I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.” “Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——” “It’s a song that Cecil gave her.
How odd girls are!” “What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly.
She went into the drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.” Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a bit.” “And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you.” “Oh, splendid!
Oh, thank you!” Mr. Beebe followed.
Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys.
She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness.
Her mother bent over her.
Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_, in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and therefore ignored by the art of to-day.
Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens,” she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.” “Mr.
Beebe knows my rude ways.” “It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he.
“Go on.” “It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly.
“I forget why—harmony or something.” “I suspected it was unscholarly.
It’s so beautiful.” “The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten.
Why throw up the sponge?” “How stupidly you talk!” said his sister.
The _Santa Conversazione_ was broken up.
After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.” “Stop thine ear against the singer—” “Wait a minute; she is finishing.” “From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” “I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear.
She had behaved splendidly, and he had helped her.
He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl’s life.
If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—” Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly.
He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned: “Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX Lying to Mr. Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial England.
They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books, mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.
Miss Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one’s face in the train.
Lucy promised, a little depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.
A gentleman is such a stand-by.” Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine continued.
“It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.
But perhaps he will come out and join you later on.” “Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off.
I do so long to see him.” “No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“She doesn’t like it.” “No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really?
How funny!
I should have thought that in this case—” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going?
It is such a pleasure to have met you!” They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right.
We just got through that time.” But her mother was annoyed.
“I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it.
There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.” Lucy had plenty to say in reply.
She described the Miss Alans’ character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?” “Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then.
It’s much pleasanter.
How wet it is!
Let’s turn in here.” “Here” was the British Museum.
Mrs. Honeychurch refused.
If they must take shelter, let it be in a shop.
Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.
Let’s go to Mudie’s.
I’ll buy a guide-book.” “You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this hole-and-corner work.
You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute.
But why not announce it?
Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?” “It’s only for a few days.” “But why at all?” Lucy was silent.
She was drifting away from her mother.
It was quite easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the incidental advantage of being true.
But she could not say it.
She disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors—Light.
Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent.
She was thinking, “My daughter won’t answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me.
Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.” This was perfectly true.
Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no longer.
It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.
She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk!
Of course I’m not tired of Windy Corner.” “Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?” She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.” “Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?” “Hush, mother!
People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s.
She bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
You see, I come into my money next year.” Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed “eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear.
“I’ve seen the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy.
I have seen so little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like to-day, but to stop.
I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl.” “And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police.
And call it a Mission—when no one wants you!
And call it Duty—when it means that you can’t stand your own home!
And call it Work—when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is!
And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.” “I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys.
But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well.
Take your independence and be gone.
Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.” Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed.
“How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!” “_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.
“More every moment.” “I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike.” “Well, I see the likeness.
The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters.” “What rubbish!
And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you asked her to stop.
I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.” Lucy clenched her teeth.
“My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked Charlotte to stop.
I wish you would keep to the point.” And the conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station.
It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy.
Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful.
“The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked.
For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old mother.
“We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining.
Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was blurred by the soft road.
“_Can’t_ we have the hood down?” she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck.
But now that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?” “It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?” “Yes, miss, they have gone.” Lucy sank back.
The carriage stopped at the Rectory.
She got out to call for Miss Bartlett.
So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary.
Waste!
That word seemed to sum up the whole of life.
Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded her mother.
Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible.
Other people had.
When the maid opened the door, she was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a great favour: might she go to church?
Mr. Beebe and his mother had already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily.
“I forgot it was Friday.
Let’s all go.
Powell can go round to the stables.” “Lucy dearest—” “No church for me, thank you.” A sigh, and they departed.
The church was invisible, but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour.
This was a stained window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation.
Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?
There was only that one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait, sir.” Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips.
George she had faced, and could have faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry!
George is so sorry!
He thought he had a right to try.
I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first.
He ought not to have tried.
I knew nothing about it at all.” If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand.
“But you must not scold him.” Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love.
I said: ‘When love comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind.
No.
Passion is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my day is over, and though there is the result.
Poor boy!
He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that whatever you felt you did not mean.
Yet”—his voice gathered strength: he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?” Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries.
Holding it up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son.” “But you do remember it?” “He has misbehaved himself from the first.” “I only was told that he loved you last Sunday.
I never could judge behaviour.
I—I—suppose he has.” Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to him.
His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said.
“I am glad he is sorry.
Do you know what he did?” “Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction.
“He only tried when he should not have tried.
You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are going to marry the man you love.
Do not go out of George’s life saying he is abominable.” “No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong.
I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all.
My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late—” “Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?” “Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.” “As his mother did.” “But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr.
Emerson_—what are you talking about?” “When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round.
She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered.
“Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in again!
A judgement!
And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church!
Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch?
Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever?” “I don’t know,” gasped Lucy.
“I don’t understand this sort of thing.
I was not meant to understand it.” “But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his principles.
I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was well she was ill.
He made her think about sin, and she went under thinking about it.” It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man.
“I did hold firm.” And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what cost!—he had won a victory over them.
“My boy shall go back to the earth untouched.” She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill. “Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present.
“George last Sunday—no, not ill: just gone under.
He is never ill.
But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
It was always touch and go.
He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live.
He will never think anything worth while.
You remember that church at Florence?” Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible.
Then we took the house here, and he goes bathing with your brother, and became better.
You saw him bathing?” “I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair.
I am deeply sorry about it.” “Then there came something about a novel.
I didn’t follow it at all; I had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old.
Ah, well, one must have failures.
George comes down to-morrow, and takes me up to his London rooms.
He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be where he is.” “Mr.
Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my account.
I am going to Greece.
Don’t leave your comfortable house.” It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled.
“How good everyone is!
And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning and heard I was going!
Here I am so comfortable with a fire.” “Yes, but you won’t go back to London.
It’s absurd.” “I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he can’t.
He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t.
I’ve been bother enough to the world by now.
I can’t have you moving out of your house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my account.
You must stop!
I am just going to Greece.” “All the way to Greece?” Her manner altered.
“To Greece?” “So you must stop.
You won’t talk about this business, I know.
I can trust you both.” “Certainly you can.
We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the life that you have chosen.” “I shouldn’t want—” “I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George?
No, it was wrong of George to try.
We have pushed our beliefs too far.
I fancy that we deserve sorrow.” She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling.
To Lucy who could not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still.
I think I will sit in the carriage.” “Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.” “Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you.
And what were you saying about going abroad?” She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands.
Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you.
I hope—it isn’t because George spoke that you are both going?” “No.” “I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.” “Thank you.” At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church.
His cassock was covered with rain.
“That’s all right,” he said kindly.
“I counted on you two keeping each other company.
It’s pouring again.
The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it.
Did Powell go round?” “I think so; I’ll see.” “No—of course, I’ll see.
How are the Miss Alans?” “Very well, thank you.” “Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?” “I—I did.” “Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the two Miss Alans?
Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm.
I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely.
“I made a slip.
Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England.” Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man.
To George, to Cecil, she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece.
And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving him?
You are leaving the man you love?” “I—I had to.” “Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?” Terror came over her, and she lied again.
She made the long, convincing speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more.
He heard her in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.
It seems to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.” She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world.
It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so dreadful.
It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the things that I might have avoided.
We can help one another but little.
I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle.
Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren’t?
Do you remember before, when you refused the room with the view?
Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent.
“Don’t trust me, Miss Honeychurch.
Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was still silent.
“‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’ I think he puts it well.
Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean.
You love George!” And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
“You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
You won’t marry the other man for his sake.” “How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man.” “But you are.” She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.
It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way.
You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat.
I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and _for which_ you marry.
I know that, with George, you will find them, and that you love him.
Then be his wife.
He is already part of you.
Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part.
You will wish that it was.
You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.
I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the body.
Ah!
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that!
Ah!
for a little directness to liberate the soul!
Your soul, dear Lucy!
I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round.
But we have souls.
I cannot say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining yours.
I cannot bear it.
It is again the darkness creeping in; it is hell.” Then he checked himself.
“What nonsense I have talked—how abstract and remote!
And I have made you cry!
Dear girl, forgive my prosiness; marry my boy.
When I think what life is, and how seldom love is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made.” She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.
Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
“Cecil—Mr.
Beebe—the ticket’s bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair.
“I’m caught in the tangle.
I must suffer and grow old away from him.
I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
They trusted me.” A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only.
Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—” “No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—” “But why should they, when you have deceived them?” Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.” “You’re not worthy of their trust.” “What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?” “One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson.
To whom do you refer?
Trust whom?” “I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George.
They have loved one another all along.” Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman.
A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?” “Mr.
Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—” “Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!” “It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly.
“It’s the part of people that you don’t understand.” Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy!
Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr.
Beebe, could you help me?” He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am more grieved than I can possibly express.
It is lamentable, lamentable—incredible.” “What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me.
Marry George, Miss Honeychurch.
He will do admirably.” He walked out and left them.
They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair.
But his face revived her.
It was the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark.
Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know.
But remember the mountains over Florence and the view.
Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise.
George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him.
Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.” “You kiss me,” said the girl.
“You kiss me.
I will try.” He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his salutation remained.
He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he managed to strengthen her.
It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once.” Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves.
They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf.
They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity.
Trembling, anxious, cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go round the world.
The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had your father’s room.
I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.” He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.” “Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window.
It was evening and again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully.
“What can such people be made of?” “Same stuff as parsons are made of.” “Nonsense!” “Quite right.
It is nonsense.” “Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.” “Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and advancing his face to hers.
“What’s there to cry at?
Kiss me here.” He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all.
When it came to the point, it was she who remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who knew whose room this had been last year.
It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.” “Now kiss me here; then here.” Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window, opened it (as the English will), and leant out.
There was the parapet, there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills.
The cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago.
A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool.
He had helped himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its name is, still shows.” “San Miniato.
I’ll just finish your sock.” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils, the Miss Bartletts!
Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?” “Not yet.” His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?” “Silly boy!
He thinks he’s being dignified.
He knew we should go off in the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands.
They had fair warning, and now he calls it an elopement.
Ridiculous boy—” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” “But it will all come right in the end.
He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women.
He has, for the second time, quite altered.
Why will men have theories about women?
I haven’t any about men.
I wish, too, that Mr. Beebe—” “You may well wish that.” “He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us again.
I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner.
I wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run.” “Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only thing I did do—and you came back to me.
So possibly you know.” He turned back into the room.
“Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to the window, so that she, too, saw all the view.
They sank upon their knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one another’s names.
Ah!
it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—” “Oh, bother that man!” But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte.
How cruel she would be to a man like that!” “Look at the lights going over the bridge.” “But this room reminds me of Charlotte.
How horrible to grow old in Charlotte’s way!
To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house.
For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
You couldn’t have made me.
When I am very happy”—she kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs.
If Charlotte had only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to silly Greece, and become different for ever.” “But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely.
He said so.” “Oh, no, she didn’t see him.
She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church.
She said so.” George was obstinate again.
“My father,” said he, “saw her, and I prefer his word.
He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett.
A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up.
He didn’t speak to her.” Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other’s arms.
It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting.
George, who disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew.
Then, why did she risk the meeting?
She knew he was there, and yet she went to church.” They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind.
She rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?” “Mean what?” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.” “Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.” “Niente.” The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?” He whispered: “Is it this?
Is this possible?
I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped.
That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down.
That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped.
I can’t explain her any other way.
Can you?
Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable.
The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend.
There are details—it burnt.
I read the book afterwards.
She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through.
She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
We can never make friends with her or thank her.
But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.” “It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.” Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited, love attained.
But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean.
[Illustration] A Room With A View By E. M. Forster CONTENTS PART ONE Chapter I The Bertolini “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at all.
She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart.
Oh, Lucy!” “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the Signora’s unexpected accent.
“It might be London.” She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A.
Oxon.
), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London?
I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside.
I suppose it is one’s being so tired.” “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno.
The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.
The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!” “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that you shouldn’t have a view.” Lucy felt that she had been selfish.
“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of course, you must look over the Arno, too.
I meant that.
The first vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no.
You must have it.” “I insist on it.
Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.” “She would never forgive _me_.” The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a little peevish.
They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument.
He said: “I have a view, I have a view.” Miss Bartlett was startled.
Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.
She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she glanced at him.
He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes.
There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes.
These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim.
So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A view?
Oh, a view!
How delightful a view is!” “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George.
He has a view too.” “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have yours.
We’ll change.” The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.
Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.” “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.” “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy.
Her cousin again repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted.
“Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son.
“There’s nothing else to say.” He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful.
Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before.
Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change?
What possible objection had she?
They would clear out in half an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality.
It was impossible to snub any one so gross.
Her face reddened with displeasure.
She looked around as much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are genteel.” “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear.
This pension is a failure.
To-morrow we will make a change.” Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness.
Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh!
Why, it’s Mr. Beebe!
Oh, how perfectly lovely!
Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are.
Oh!” Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint: “How do you do, Mr. Beebe?
I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.” The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.
But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
“Just fancy how small the world is.
Summer Street, too, makes it so specially funny.” “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—” “Yes, I heard from mother so last week.
She didn’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr.
Beebe is—’” “Quite right,” said the clergyman.
“I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June.
I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.” “Oh, how glad I am!
The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.” “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.” “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.” He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons.
He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before.
It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field.
“Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded.
“The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.” “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table.
“Mr.
Beebe, you are wrong.
The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.” “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin.
“We are in luck.” And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them.
People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would grow upon them.
The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do.
Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them.
And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato!
They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words.
I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.” The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did.
It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more than cloth.
Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her daughter.
It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.
Was this really Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.
She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle.
“We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.
“The first evening means so much.
When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.” He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?” “Emerson.” “Is he a friend of yours?” “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.” “Then I will say no more.” He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing.
His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.” “You acted very naturally,” said he.
He seemed thoughtful, and after a few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of accepting.” “No _harm_, of course.
But we could not be under an obligation.” “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show gratitude.
He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he means.
He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them.
He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite.
It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.” Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice.” “I think he is; nice and tiresome.
I differ from him on almost every point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores.
When he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up.
He has no tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will not keep his opinions to himself.
We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.” “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?” Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?” “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet.
He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains.
Of course, he has all his father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.” “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett.
“So you think I ought to have accepted their offer?
You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?” “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.” “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?” He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared.
“Why didn’t you talk, Lucy?
He prefers young people, I’m sure.
I do hope I haven’t monopolized him.
I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time.” “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a clergyman.” “My dear Lucia—” “Well, you know what I mean.
And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.” “Funny girl!
How you do remind me of your mother.
I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe.” “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.” “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world.
I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.” “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine.
She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered.
Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.” And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more careful.
It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.” Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat.
Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room.
It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England.
Signora Bertolini is so English.” “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy.
“We dread going to bed.” “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed.
“If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful!
We were so sorry for you at dinner.” “I think he was meaning to be kind.” “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr.
Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature.
Of course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.” “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
No one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know.
No, he is not tactful; yet, have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?” “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.
“Are not beauty and delicacy the same?” “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly.
“But things are so difficult, I sometimes think.” She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms.
I’m so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again.
He has let me come and ask you.
He would be so pleased.” “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious.
I must apologize for my interference.” Gravely displeased, he turned to go.
Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours.
It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only here through your kindness.
If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it.
Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?” She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this.
I do not wish the acceptance to come from you.
Grant me that, at all events.” Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously: “Mr.
Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.” The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally.
But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out.” Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath.
All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first.
Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms!
It is all he can do to keep polite.” “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe.
Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.
“Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part.
Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature.
Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow.
Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said: “I think one might venture now.
No, Lucy, do not stir.
I will superintend the move.” “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear.
It is my affair.” “But I would like to help you.” “No, dear.” Charlotte’s energy!
And her unselfishness!
She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
So Lucy felt, or strove to feel.
And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful.
At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room.
Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.” Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him.
I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.” “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.
It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances.
It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation.
Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle.
Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson.
So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him.
Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.
It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
An electric tram came rushing underneath the window.
No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand.
Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go.
Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.
Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.
The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway.
Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.
So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone.
By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.
Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out?
Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone.
Miss Bartlett could not allow this.
Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin.
Oh, no!
that would never do.
Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person.
Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe.
Italians understand.
A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.
Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.” Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad.
The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.” Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut!
Miss Lucy!
I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He does but touch the surface of things.
As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it.
The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.” This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.
Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno.
How delightfully warm!
But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?
Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante.
San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story.
The men on the river were fishing.
(Untrue; but then, so is most information.)
Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried: “A smell!
a true Florentine smell!
Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.” “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
Buon giorno!
Buon giorno!” bowing right and left.
“Look at that adorable wine-cart!
How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!” So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.
It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno!
Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors.
_That_ is the true democracy.
Though I am a real Radical as well.
There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy.
“We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.” “I see, I see.
And now you have gone over to the enemy.” “Oh, please—!
If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right.
And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.” “Shameful!
A manufacturing district, I suppose?” “No—in the Surrey hills.
About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.” Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well.
It is full of the very nicest people.
Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?” “Very well indeed.” “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?” “Why, she rents a field of us!
How funny!” Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?” “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob.
“Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.” Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
Italy receded.
They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her.
And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed: “Bless us!
Bless us and save us!
We’ve lost the way.” Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window.
But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost!
lost!
My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.
How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do?
Two lone females in an unknown town.
Now, this is what _I_ call an adventure.” Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven!
And no, you are not, not, _not_ to look at your Baedeker.
Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it.
We will simply drift.” Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became discontented herself.
For one ravishing moment Italy appeared.
She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale.
There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven.
Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop, because it looked so typical.
It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown.
But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness.
Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically.
It was Santa Croce.
The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them.
I do detest conventional intercourse.
Nasty!
they are going into the church, too.
Oh, the Britisher abroad!” “We sat opposite them at dinner last night.
They have given us their rooms.
They were so very kind.” “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish.
“They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.
It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.” “What would you ask us?” Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she, at all events, would get full marks.
In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried: “There goes my local-colour box!
I must have a word with him!” And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes.
Then she began to get tired.
The beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places.
She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original.
But at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both gesticulating largely.
Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her Baedeker.
How could she find her way home?
How could she find her way about in Santa Croce?
Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in Florence again.
A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans.
Of course, it must be a wonderful building.
But how like a barn!
And how very cold!
Of course, it contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper.
But who was to tell her which they were?
She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
There was no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she began to be happy.
She puzzled out the Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.
She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed.
Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated.
What could this mean?
They did it again and again.
Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue.
Punishment followed quickly.
The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward.
She was too late.
He fell heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted forward also.
“Hard in life, hard in death.
Go out into the sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
Intolerable bishop!” The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and frightened!
But what else can you expect from a church?” The child’s legs had become as melting wax.
Each time that old Mr. Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar.
Fortunately an Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue.
By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
He stood.
Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson.
“You have done more than all the relics in the world.
I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy.
There is no scheme of the universe—” He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons.
She was determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply.
“But what are you doing here?
Are you doing the church?
Are you through with the church?” “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance.
“I came here with Miss Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.” “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.” “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
“I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded.
It’s worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker.
_That’s_ worth minding.” Lucy was puzzled.
She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where the idea would lead?
She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you.
I really came to help with the child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.” “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say.
You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious.
But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it.
Lucy could not get cross.
Mr. Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him.
On the other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him.
It was at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope.
It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will kindly tell me which they are.” The son nodded.
With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel.
There was a hint of the teacher about him.
She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared.
Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective.
Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true?
How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!” “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort!
Built by faith indeed!
That simply means the workmen weren’t paid properly.
And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
Look at that fat man in blue!
He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.” He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might.
The audience shifted uneasily, and so did Lucy.
She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her.
They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it?
Yes or no?” George replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all.
I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.” “You will never go up,” said his father.
“You and I, dear boy, will lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives.” “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is, going up.
It did happen like that, if it happened at all.” “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice.
“The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.” The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands.
They filed out of the chapel in silence.
Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“There’s plenty of room for us all.
Stop!” The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.” George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is.
I don’t remember.” “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
It’s that Mr.
Eager.
Why did he go?
Did we talk too loud?
How vexatious.
I shall go and say we are sorry.
Hadn’t I better?
Then perhaps he will come back.” “He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
Cuthbert Eager.
Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent.
The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her.
“He will try to be kind.” “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters.
But he is kind to people because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.” “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully—” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain.
Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness.
She saw him once again at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns.
Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only find solution in the night.
The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people.
They won’t come back.” “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy.
“Have you looked at those saints?” “Yes,” said Lucy.
“They are lovely.
Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin?” He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.
There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists.
But Mr. Emerson was only half interested.
He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily.
“I saw nothing in it.” “I like Giotto,” she replied.
“It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values.
Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
A baby is worth a dozen saints.
And my baby’s worth the whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.” Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated.
“He’s unhappy.” “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?
What more is one to give him?
And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God.
With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.” She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one.
She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked.
“He comes out for his holiday to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone.
Eh?
What did you say?” Lucy had made no suggestion.
Suddenly he said: “Now don’t be stupid over this.
I don’t require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me.
He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose?
But let yourself go.
You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night.
Let yourself go.
Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself.
It will be good for both of you.” To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.” “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.” “What things?” “The things of the universe.
It is quite true.
They don’t.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?” In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: “‘From far, from eve and morning, The stuff of life to knit me George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?
We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
But why should this make us unhappy?
Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice.
I don’t believe in this world sorrow.” Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us.
Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.” Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.
A young man melancholy because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried.
“You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then she became matronly.
“Oh, but your son wants employment.
Has he no particular hobby?
Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother.
Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.” The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it.
Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.
Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.
The dear George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd.
He approached, his face in the shadow.
He said: “Miss Bartlett.” “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective.
“Where?
Where?” “In the nave.” “I see.
Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson.
“Poor girl!” She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
“Poor girl?
I fail to understand the point of that remark.
I think myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you.
I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid time.
Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it.
Good-bye.
Thank you both so much for all your kindness.
Ah, yes!
there does come my cousin.
A delightful morning!
Santa Croce is a wonderful church.” She joined her cousin.
Chapter III Music, Violets, and the Letter “S” It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano.
She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected.
The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom.
Lucy had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.
Nor was she the passionate young lady, who performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the pictorial style.
And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory.
Victory of what and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano.
A few people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep.
She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarette-case.
Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it.
It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower.
The seats were filled with a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork.
Among the promised items was “Miss Honeychurch.
Piano.
Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III.
He was in suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends.
With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory.
He was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen.
The audience clapped, no less respectful.
It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners.
I do not consider her choice of a piece happy.
Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs.” “Introduce me.” “She will be delighted.
She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon.” “My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe.
“Why ever did she listen to it?” When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch, disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face.
She loved going to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and meringues.
He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also.
But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him: “If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting both for us and for her.” Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing!
Some one said just the same to mother, and she said she trusted I should never live a duet.” “Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?” “She doesn’t mind it.
But she doesn’t like one to get excited over anything; she thinks I am silly about it.
She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any one’s.
She has never got over it.
Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant—” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality.
She could not complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet.
The whole life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey, and the hills were dirty purple.
Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold, tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and a tickling cough in her throat.
On another day, when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray.
She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe.” “Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy.
This was a stock remark, the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition.
Miss Lavish was so original.
Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness.
For that, and for other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is writing a book?” “They do say so.” “What is it about?” “It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know.” “I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.
We started such friends.
But I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce.
Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.” “The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.” He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish.
They were always in each other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third.
Miss Lavish he believed he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning.
Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells?
All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work.
Girls like Lucy were charming to look at, but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped.
The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore.
But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse.
She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill!
And Mr. Beebe here besides.
Who would suppose this is Italy?
There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.” She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in my room with the door shut.
Doors shut; indeed, most necessary.
No one has the least idea of privacy in this country.
And one person catches it from another.” Lucy answered suitably.
Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.
The Italians are a most unpleasant people.
They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves.
We are at their mercy.
They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires.
From the cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial!
They have no conception of the intellectual life.
How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer over the children’s edjucaishion.
_Hi_ won’t ’ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’” Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way.
Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers.
Indeed, who would have supposed that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last the cause was disclosed.
From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “E.
L.” “That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman.
“A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she’d start a pipe.” “Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.
She took to it, practically in despair, after her life’s work was carried away in a landslip.
Surely that makes it more excusable.” “What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say they nearly always do.
Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink.
She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written.
The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she had an idea.
First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came here—this must on no account get round.
And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.” Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring.
She felt she had made almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.” Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade.
That old Mr. Emerson, who puts things very strangely—” Her jaw dropped.
She was silent.
Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper: “Stomach.
He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind.
I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden.
As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter.
But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought.
She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce.
Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson.
Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ Just imagine!
‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak.
I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking.
I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman!
I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place.
But that was not all.
After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.” “Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I shall go alone.’ She went.
At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.” “Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows.
No one will ever know.
Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.” “Mr.
Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice?
I do so want to know.” Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.
“No; but it is so difficult.
Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him.
Miss Alan, what do you think?
Is he nice?” The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.
Mr. Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying: “I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.” “Violets?
Oh, dear!
Who told you about the violets?
How do things get round?
A pension is a bad place for gossips.
No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce.
Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch!
It really was too bad.
No, I have quite changed.
I do _not_ like the Emersons.
They are _not_ nice.” Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly.
He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed.
He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them.
Miss Lavish, who represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans, who stood for good breeding, were following her.
Miss Bartlett, smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil.
The case of Lucy was different.
She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail.
After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now.
Even their seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once.
Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite politely, of course.” “Most right of her.
They don’t understand our ways.
They must find their level.” Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under.
They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son.
He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them.
It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle.
There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief.
“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said Lucy.
“I want to go round the town in the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say: “I wish we could.
Unluckily I have letters.
If you do want to go out alone, won’t you be better on your feet?” “Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!” But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her from the window, “and she knows it.
I put it down to too much Beethoven.” Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr. Beebe was right.
Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music.
She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan.
Conversation was tedious; she wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram.
This she might not attempt.
It was unladylike.
Why?
Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why.
It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different.
Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much.
But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.
The dragons have gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst.
She reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early Victorian song.
It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas!
the creature grows degenerate.
In her heart also there are springing up strange desires.
She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.
Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are alive.
Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
Nor has she any system of revolt.
Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she had done so.
This afternoon she was peculiarly restive.
She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved.
As she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus, being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it.
(A pity in art of course signified the nude.)
Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it.
She felt a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s “Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni Madonnas.
For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.
She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her to be conscious of it.
“The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to her.
The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it.
Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind.
It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.
An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him, and rest content.
Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.
It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky.
Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.
“Cinque lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest.
He frowned; he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all.
A crowd rose out of the dusk.
It hid this extraordinary man from her, and bore him away to the fountain.
Mr. George Emerson happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where the man had been.
How very odd!
Across something.
Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?” “Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything.
She had complained of dullness, and lo!
one man was stabbed, and another held her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade.
He must have carried her.
He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees.
She repeated: “Oh, what have I done?” “You fainted.” “I—I am very sorry.” “How are you now?” “Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home.
There’s no point in our stopping.” He held out his hand to pull her up.
She pretended not to see it.
The cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily.
The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been!
I might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well.
I can go alone, thank you.” His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?” “I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.
I must have dropped them out there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously.
“Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?” He added to his kindness.
As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!” She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.” “Yes, I am, thank you so very much.” “No, you aren’t.
You’d go openly if you were.” “But I had rather—” “Then I don’t fetch your photographs.” “I had rather be alone.” He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him.
“And don’t move till I come back.” In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in dreams.
The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day, and joined itself to earth.
How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square?
Again the thought occurred to her, “Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man, had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder.
Oddly enough, it was an easy topic.
She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before.
Being strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood.
She rose without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her, she walked firmly enough towards the Arno.
There a cabman signalled to them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police!
Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish.
When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?” He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?” “Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr.
Emerson!” “Well?” “Where are the photographs?” He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.” “I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.
Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood.
There!
I’m glad I’ve told you; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them.” He pointed down-stream.
“They’ve gone.” The river swirled under the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man.
“For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled.
It isn’t exactly that a man has died.” Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.” “Mr.
Emerson—” He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.” They were close to their pension.
She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment.
He did likewise.
There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship.
She moved her elbows before saying: “I have behaved ridiculously.” He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what came over me.” “I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.” “Oh, all right.” “And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?” “I’m afraid I don’t.” “I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?” “Your behaviour?
Oh, yes, all right—all right.” “Thank you so much.
And would you—” She could not carry her request any further.
The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
He had thrown her photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason.
It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man.
He would do her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might even have a high opinion of her.
But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe.
It was useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.
She had been in his arms, and he remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari’s shop.
It was not exactly that a man had died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents do happen, and then one returns to the old life!” “I don’t.” Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.” “But why, Mr. Emerson?
What do you mean?” “I shall want to live, I say.” Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno, whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson.
She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also.
They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.
It might have been most unpleasant.
Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone.
None of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the embankment.
Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure, not that she had encountered it.
This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action.
There were two plans between which she had to choose.
Mr. Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies.
Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?
Charlotte declined for herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.
But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth.
“It’s very kind of Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you.
I had much rather.” “Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.
How abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always!
But now she should alter.
All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the Lung’ Arno.
The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and colour.
Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it.
She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this, too!” Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did.
“Look, Lucia!
Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party.
I feared you would repent you of your choice.” Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.
Yesterday had been a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo.
Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not to re-enter it.
She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately remained.
Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria.
She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance.
For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.
She hailed them briskly.
The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett.
“After your despair of yesterday!
What a fortunate thing!” “Aha!
Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck.
Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?” “I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.” The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless creatures.
I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn’t pry.” She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few calculations in realism.
Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material.
A good deal of it was unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt.
The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note.
For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.” That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?” Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot.
But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish concluded.
“It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline.
There will be a deal of local colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall also introduce some humorous characters.
And let me give you all fair warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.” “Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett.
“I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons.” Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can.
For I repeat and I insist, and I have always held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life.” There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded.
Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett.
“That last remark struck me as so particularly true.
It should be a most pathetic novel.” Lucy assented.
At present her great aim was not to get put into it.
Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,” continued Miss Bartlett slowly.
“None but the superficial would be shocked at her.
We had a long talk yesterday.
She believes in justice and truth and human interest.
She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr.
Eager!
Why, how nice!
What a pleasant surprise!” “Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.” “We were chatting to Miss Lavish.” His brow contracted.
“So I saw.
Were you indeed?
Andate via!
sono occupato!” The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile.
“I am about to venture a suggestion.
Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a drive in the hills?
We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour’s ramble on the hillside.
The view thence of Florence is most beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape.
Decidedly.
But who looks at it to-day?
Ah, the world is too much for us.” Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that Mr.
Eager was no commonplace chaplain.
He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home.
He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent.
Tea at a Renaissance villa?
Nothing had been said about it yet.
But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same.
But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew.
A drive in the hills with Mr.
Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no longer the greatest of them.
She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain.
“In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity.
Andate via!
andate presto, presto!
Ah, the town!
Beautiful as it is, it is the town.” They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies.
To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and humiliating.” “Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened.
She can hardly bear to speak of it.” She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question.
“Do not blame her, please, Mr.
Eager.
The fault is mine: I left her unchaperoned.” “So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable.
His dark, handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.” “One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience.
I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?” Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—” “Were over at the Loggia.” “That must have saved you much.
You have not, of course, seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.” Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal league of Italy with youth.
He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr.
Eager, binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico’s angels.
She tore.
A shrill cry rose from the vendor.
The book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr.
Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a grievance.
His mysterious persecution of Mr.
Eager became relentless; the air rang with his threats and lamentations.
He appealed to Lucy; would not she intercede?
He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on bread.
He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued.
Under the chaplain’s guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy.
She had been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr.
Eager, she knew not why.
And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased to respect them.
She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist.
She doubted that Mr.
Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose.
They were tried by some new test, and they were found wanting.
As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte she was exactly the same.
It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact.
A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press.
I came across him at Brixton.” They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr.
Eager, “one has only sympathy for their success.
The desire for education and for social advance—in these things there is something not wholly vile.
There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as they would make of it.” “Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.” He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.” “Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead.
I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with me.
He was in my London parish long ago.
The other day in Santa Croce, when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him.
Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub.” “What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr.
Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended.
Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity.
Lucy, though she wished never to see the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man?
We know that already.” “Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all.
The boy—an innocent child at the time—I will exclude.
God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him.” “Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not hear.” “To speak plainly,” said Mr.
Eager, “it is.
I will say no more.” For the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the first time in her life.
“You have said very little.” “It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.
He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips.
It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily.
“That man murdered his wife!” “How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.
That day in Santa Croce—did they say anything against me?” “Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.” “Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you.
But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
“They’re nothing to me.” “How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene.
The shopman was possibly listening.
“She will find it difficult.
For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God.” The addition of God was striking.
But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
A silence followed which might have been impressive, but was merely awkward.
Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive.
“Drive?
Oh, is our drive to come off?” Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr.
Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed.
“It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all.
Why should he invite us in that absurd manner?
We might as well invite him.
We are each paying for ourselves.” Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish.” “How?” “Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.” “That will mean another carriage.” “Far worse.
Mr.
Eager does not like Eleanor.
She knows it herself.
The truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.” They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank.
Lucy stood by the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer, or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain.
The well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets?
Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it.
Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck.
She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank.
As she groped she murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr.
Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we must be prepared.
It is you they really want; I am only asked for appearances.
You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will follow behind.
A one-horse carriage would do for us.
Yet how difficult it is!” “It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.” “Oh, dear, Lucy!
I do hope Florence isn’t boring you.
Speak the word, and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.” “Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her mother’s letters could be.
She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway.
She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs.
Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news that interested her least.
“Do you know the Vyses?” “Oh, not that way back.
We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria.” “They’re nice people, the Vyses.
So clever—my idea of what’s really clever.
Don’t you long to be in Rome?” “I die for it!” The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant.
It has no grass, no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick.
By an odd chance—unless we believe in a presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity.
Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before.
Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly.
“Here’s an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel?
For I do know what I want.
I’m sick of Florence.
No, you said you’d go to the ends of the earth!
Do!
Do!” Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied: “Oh, you droll person!
Pray, what would become of your drive in the hills?” They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up the stony hill.
Mr. Beebe recognized him at once.
Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.
And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light.
To her Mr.
Eager objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition.
But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
She did not mind.
Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy.
The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss Lavish.
For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting Mr.
Eager, had doubled the size of the party.
And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus transformed.
Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.
But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr.
Eager, repressive towards Miss Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring.
She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate.
But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully.
In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy.
She had refused, not because she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he did know.
And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia, but by the river.
To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled emotion, but of the whole fabric.
There was really something blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word.
This sense of wickedness had been slight at first.
She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo.
But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again.
And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr.
Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling?
As a student of art?” “Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!” “Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like myself?” “Oh, no.
I am here as a tourist.” “Oh, indeed,” said Mr.
Eager.
“Are you indeed?
If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.
The result is, they mix up towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl.
You know the American girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’ There’s travelling for you.
Ha!
ha!
ha!” “I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit.
“The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.” “Quite so.
Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are here for trade, for example.
But the greater part are students.
Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico.
I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left.
No, you can only see it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall.
She is very proud of that thick hedge.
Inside, perfect seclusion.
One might have gone back six hundred years.
Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?” “It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish.
“Tell me, where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day?” But Mr.
Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr.
Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill.
“Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’?
He is working at Gemistus Pletho.
Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.” During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully.
Lucy had a spasm of envy.
Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.
They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road.
“Piano!
piano!” said Mr.
Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped his horses up again.
Now Mr.
Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or was he one of its manifestations?
The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.
“Piano!
piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.
Phaethon, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was most unpleasant.
The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr.
Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but at its manner.
At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and patted them on the back to signify his approval.
And Miss Lavish, though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried.
“But I dare say I shall receive scant support.
I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life.
This is what _I_ call an adventure.” “We must not submit,” said Mr.
Eager.
“I knew he was trying it on.
He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.” “Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood in no awe.
“Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there?
To be driven by lovers—A king might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I know.” Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect.
Mr.
Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will, was determined to make himself heard.
He addressed the driver again.
Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream, with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker, and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased.
Why should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto.
She pointed at the other carriage.
Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other.
Then Persephone got down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr.
Eager, smiting his hands together as the carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson.
“It is defeat.
You have parted two people who were happy.” Mr.
Eager shut his eyes.
He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but he would not speak to him.
The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took up the matter warmly.
He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money.
He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.
We have no rights over his soul.” Miss Lavish frowned.
It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said.
“He jolted us.” “That I deny.
It was as restful as sleeping.
Aha!
he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder?
He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is justified.
And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl, too.
It doesn’t do to injure young people.
Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici?” Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have.
Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature?” “The Lord knows.
Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go fighting against the Spring.’” Mr.
Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured.
“‘War not with the May’ would render a correct meaning.” “The point is, we have warred with it.
Look.” He pointed to the Val d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them.
Do you suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man?
But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.” No one encouraged him to talk.
Presently Mr.
Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain.
It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before.
He had ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending.
Standing there, he had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work.
But where exactly had he stood?
That was the question which Mr.
Eager hoped to solve now.
And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups.
Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask.
In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio Baldovinetti, but the drive.
Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was very sorry that she had asked him.
She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him.
Mr. Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish.
“Oh, but I shall die!
Of course it was the railway!” She could not control her mirth.
“He is the image of a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.” “Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion.
“Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—” “I can’t stop.
Let me go my wicked way.
A porter—” “Eleanor!” “I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy.
“The Emersons won’t hear, and they wouldn’t mind if they did.” Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly.
“Pouf!
Wouf!
You naughty girl!
Go away!” “Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr.
Eager, I’m sure.” “I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.” “Mr.
Eager will be offended.
It is your party.” “Please, I’d rather stop here with you.” “No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish.
“It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.
Miss Lucy, you are to go.
We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.” The girl was stubborn.
As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.
Such a one was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte.
She wished she had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Oh, I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here.” Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm.
Lucy did not look at the view either.
She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish.
“Observe my foresight.” With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy.
The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
If I do feel it coming on I shall stand.
Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist.
“Here we are, all settled delightfully.
Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown.
Sit down, dear; you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared her throat.
“Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold.
It’s the tiniest cough, and I have had it three days.
It’s nothing to do with sitting here at all.” There was only one way of treating the situation.
At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr.
Eager, vanquished by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.
The miscreant, a bony young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up.
Of course he knew where.
Not so far either.
His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon.
He should just think he did know where.
He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary.
What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good?
Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings!
He showed her his cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?” She was correct as usual.
He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her.
Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.
Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
She thanked him with real pleasure.
In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
For the first time she felt the influence of Spring.
His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?” “Ma buoni uomini.” He bowed.
Certainly.
Good men first, violets afterwards.
They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker.
They were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces.
He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant boughs.
She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.
Not a step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?” There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.
The voice of Mr.
Eager?
He shrugged his shoulders.
An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge.
She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen.
The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
Light and beauty enveloped her.
She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.” She did not answer.
From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view, and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam.
But never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival.
For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.
He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves.
The bushes above them closed.
He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called, “Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.
What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was slow to discover.
Mr.
Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk.
Mr. Emerson, seeking his son, was told whereabouts to find him.
Mr. Beebe, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the return home.
There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment.
Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics.
Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise.
Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett.
Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager.
Mr. Emerson had lost George.
Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square.
Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable.
He climbed on to the box shivering, with his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather.
“Let us go immediately,” he told them.
“The signorino will walk.” “All the way?
He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently.
I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.
He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence.
He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.
He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also.
Not so these English.
They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents, but infinitely the least dangerous.
Once back in the town, he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more.
Of course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it.
But after all, what have we to do with taverns?
Real menace belongs to the drawing-room.
It was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun.
Lucy sat beside her; Mr.
Eager sat opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious.
They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together.
The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol.
There was a lightning flash, and Miss Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front.
At the next flash, Lucy screamed also.
Mr.
Eager addressed her professionally: “Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith.
If I might say so, there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements.
Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?” “No—of course—” “Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous.
The steel knives, the only articles which might attract the current, are in the other carriage.
And, in any case, we are infinitely safer than if we were walking.
Courage—courage and faith.” Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand.
At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles, gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr.
Eager!” called Mr. Beebe.
“We want your assistance.
Will you interpret for us?” “George!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way.
He may be killed.” “Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver is no help.
Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.” “He may be killed!” cried the old man.
“He may be killed!” “Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage.
“In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.” “What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr.
Eager know?” “Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing.
But—” she pointed at the driver—“_he_ knows everything.
Dearest, had we better?
Shall I?” She took out her purse.
“It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book, she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it.
As well this ending to his day as any.
But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road.
The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen.
If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt.
They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.
They descended from the carriages; they embraced each other.
It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them.
For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly.
In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike.
Miss Lavish calculated that, even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the accident.
Mr.
Eager mumbled a temperate prayer.
But the drivers, through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me.
Kiss me again.
Only you can understand me.
You warned me to be careful.
And I—I thought I was developing.” “Do not cry, dearest.
Take your time.” “I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse.
Once by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?” The thought disturbed her repentance.
As a matter of fact, the storm was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not.
One would always pray against that.” “He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that.
I simply slipped into those violets.
No, I want to be really truthful.
I am a little to blame.
I had silly thoughts.
The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.” “In a book?” “Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.” “And then?” “But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
Indeed, she had little more to learn.
With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her.
All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
“It is so hard to be absolutely truthful.” “Don’t be troubled, dearest.
Wait till you are calmer.
We will talk it over before bed-time in my room.” So they re-entered the city with hands clasped.
It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others.
The storm had ceased, and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son.
Mr. Beebe had regained good humour, and Mr.
Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish.
Charlotte alone she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening.
She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it.
All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be carefully laid before her cousin.
And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself.
I shan’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know what.” Miss Alan asked her to play.
She refused vehemently.
Music seemed to her the employment of a child.
She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own.
Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay.
In vain she tried to check, or at all events to accelerate, the tale.
It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach: “Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire.
Come into my room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.” With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the girl.
Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?” She was unprepared for the question.
It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything.
A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done?
A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.” The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door.
A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes.
She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?” “The driver?” “My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.” Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?” “I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.” “I, too, intend to judge him charitably.
But unfortunately I have met the type before.
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first?
Come here and listen to me.
I am only gathering it from his own remarks.
Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another?” “Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude.
There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish.
But we are no farther on with our question.
What do you propose to do?” An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it.
But—as you said—it is my affair.
Mine and his.” “And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?” “Certainly not.
There would be no difficulty.
Whatever you ask him he answers, yes or no; then it is over.
I have been frightened of him.
But now I am not one little bit.” “But we fear him for you, dear.
You are so young and inexperienced, you have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round.
This afternoon, for example, if I had not arrived, what would have happened?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?” “I hadn’t time to think.
You came.” “Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?” “I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off.
She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett.
“You will be seen from the road.” Lucy obeyed.
She was in her cousin’s power.
She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started.
Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man!
We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless.
There is Mr.
Eager, but you do not trust him.
Oh, for your brother!
He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.
Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead.
There are still left some men who can reverence woman.” As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and ranged them upon the pin cushion.
Then she blew into her gloves and said: “It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.” “What train?” “The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?” “At eight.” “Signora Bertolini would be upset.” “We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.” “I expect she will.
However, we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses’ hotel.
Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?” “Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained motionless and silent.
To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome.
Lucy, when admonished, began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte, who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly.
She knelt down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.
But she was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her, but needed her to love.
For it was in ominous tones that she said, after a long pause: “Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?” Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant.
Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: “Charlotte dear, what do you mean?
As if I have anything to forgive!” “You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
I know well how much I vex you at every turn.” “But no—” Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged martyr.
“Ah, but yes!
I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped.
I might have known it would not do.
You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you.
I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.” “Please—” “My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and were often able to leave me at home.
I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary.
You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.” “You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other, heart and soul.
They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own.
“Failed to make you happy; failed in my duty to your mother.
She has been so generous to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.” “But mother will understand.
It is not your fault, this trouble, and it isn’t a disaster either.” “It is my fault, it is a disaster.
She will never forgive me, and rightly.
For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish?” “Every right.” “When I was here for your sake?
If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you.
Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.” Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence.
There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.” The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her.
But in case she should blame you in any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to.
I will never speak of it either to her or to any one.” Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.
Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background.
George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually.
At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since, it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent.
She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed, for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love.
Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters.
Before she reached them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle.
Thus it was that, though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers.
She was still dressed.
It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved.
At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said: “I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.” Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr. Emerson.” His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true.
It can’t all be true.
I want not to be muddled.
I want to grow older quickly.” Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear.
You need all the rest you can get.” In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun.
They were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied.
A poet—none was present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room.
One—a boy of nineteen—was studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano.
From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him what she had written.
And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother.
“I tell you I’m getting fairly sick.” “For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
“Time they did.” “I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.” “It’s his third go, isn’t it?” “Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.” “I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy.
I don’t know how girls manage things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.” “Do you indeed, dear?
How interesting!” “I feel—never mind.” He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse.
I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’” “Yes, mother, you told me.
A jolly good letter.” “I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.
But—’” She stopped reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all.
He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth.
When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.” “Nor me.” “You?” Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?” “He asked me for my permission also.” She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir.
“Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?
What ever did you say?” “I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’” “What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come.
There they still are!” “I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.” “Peeping like that!
Can’t I look out of my own window?” But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves.
For a brief space they were silent.
Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave a nervous gulp.
“Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy.
He practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her?
And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.” “I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.” “I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth.
“There!
Fly into a stew!
I can’t help it—had to say it.
I had to say no.
He ought never to have asked me.” “Ridiculous child!” cried his mother.
“You think you’re so holy and truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit.
Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say?
I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?” “Oh, do keep quiet, mother!
I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.
I tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right.
But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.” “No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the subject, “I shall not keep quiet.
You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.” “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
“I only let out I didn’t like him.
I don’t hate him, but I don’t like him.
What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.” He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“I know his mother; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick the piano!
He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained dissatisfied.
She added: “And he has beautiful manners.” “I liked him till just now.
I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.” “Mr.
Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest.
“I don’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in.” “You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means.
He said: ‘Mr.
Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he meant.
He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking.
Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.” “You never can, dear.
But I can.
You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.” The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it.
But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust.
Cecil praised one too much for being athletic.
Was that it?
Cecil made one talk in one’s own way.
This tired one.
Was that it?
And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow’s cap.
Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself.
He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother.
“‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light.
She keeps that flat abominably—” “Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?” “Don’t interrupt so foolishly.
Where was I?
Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing.
I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything.
But I do not know—’” “Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation.
He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles.
Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds.
But it was transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald.
Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described.
He was medieval.
Like a Gothic statue.
Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism.
A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant.
And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!” “I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals.
They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.
We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the furniture.
“This is indeed a joyous day!
I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy.” “I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat.
She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis.
Then she saw her brother’s face.
Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?” Cecil suggested.
“And I’d stop here and tell my mother.” “We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.” They passed into the sunlight.
Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and descend out of sight by the steps.
They would descend—he knew their ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed, until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical.
He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s.
That day she had seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel.
But Italy worked some marvel in her.
It gave her light, and—which he held more precious—it gave her shadow.
Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence.
She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness.
Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other.
It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the same to him as before.
Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language.
She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her.
He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
The things that really mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy.
His mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he moved to the writing table.
There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many erasures.
He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.
With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table.
The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter.
He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about it none the less.
It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected.
“I represent all that he despises.
Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?” The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
“Mr.
Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse.
Do you suppose that I shall get it?” “I should say so.
Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.” “Pfui!” “I know,” said Cecil.
“I know.
I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.” For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip.
Isn’t this news?” “News?
I don’t understand you,” said Cecil.
“News?” Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field.
He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!” “Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself.
Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen!
Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
But his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question!
To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church!
I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.” “I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly.
“I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board.
Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the right names.
I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery.
It is very remiss of me.
Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.” Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?” “I have no profession,” said Cecil.
“It is another example of my decadence.
My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
I know I ought to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.” “You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe.
“It is a wonderful opportunity, the possession of leisure.” His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally.
He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve.
I daren’t face the healthy person—for example, Freddy Honeychurch.” “Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?” “Admirable.
The sort who has made England what she is.” Cecil wondered at himself.
Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly contrary?
He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea before evening service.” “I suppose Anne never told them you were here.
In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives.
The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?” “I know the faults of Mary.
She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.” “The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small.” They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many.
No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.” “She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree.
At present she has none.” “At present?” “I’m not cynical.
I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle.
Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.” Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?” “Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps.
Oh, I forgot; of course, you knew her before.
No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.” “In what way?” Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string.
Picture number two: the string breaks.” The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically.
At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?” “No.
I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.” “It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst.
He cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken?
What do you mean?” “I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.” The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize.
I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners.
Was this the reception his action would get from the world?
Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly.
“I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.” “Not that.
But you ought to have stopped me.
I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes.
Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with any one; certainly not with you.” “You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?” Mr. Beebe pulled himself together.
Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions.
He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet.
I foresaw at Florence that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended.
I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio.
He did not omit to do so.
“She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her.” “Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?” Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march.
Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried.
He looked at Lucy.
In her presence he could not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.
I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great and small.
I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and mother.
And now I want my tea.” “You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted.
“How dare you be serious at Windy Corner?” He took his tone from her.
There was no more heavy beneficence, no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures.
None of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe.
Away from it, in the solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical.
But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious.
It has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart.
The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed.
Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel sentimental.
Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.
If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true.
Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them greatly.
They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door.
Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance.
Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as a mother-in-law.
As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him.
People congratulated Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid.
They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with the dowagers.
When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?” “I suppose so.
Mother, would it be?” “Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and said: “To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.” “I am so sorry that you were stranded.” “Not that, but the congratulations.
It is so disgusting, the way an engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment.
All those old women smirking!” “One has to go through it, I suppose.
They won’t notice us so much next time.” “But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong.
An engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and should be treated as such.” Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially correct.
The spirit of the generations had smiled through them, rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth.
To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite different—personal love.
Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said.
“Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?” “I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public.
The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic.
Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato.” “Inglese Italianato?” “E un diavolo incarnato!
You know the proverb?” She did not.
Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother.
But Cecil, since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.” “We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?” “It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in, or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?” She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert.
“I don’t see any difference.
Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same place.” “We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap.
“This is me.
That’s Windy Corner.
The rest of the pattern is the other people.
Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.” She leant placidly back.
Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and that’s Mr. Beebe.” “A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.” Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect what they meant.
She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried.
“I consider him far above the average.
I only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful ones, is Mr.
Eager, the English chaplain at Florence.
He was truly insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate.
He was a snob, and so conceited, and he did say such unkind things.” “What sort of things?” “There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife.” “Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing.
Mr.
Eager would never come to the point.
He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.” “Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander?
It was, I believe, chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped.
People pretended he was vulgar, but he certainly wasn’t that.” “Poor old man!
What was his name?” “Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr.
Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know.
I hate him.
I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto.
I hate him.
Nothing can hide a petty nature.
I _hate_ him.” “My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“You’ll blow my head off!
Whatever is there to shout over?
I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen.” He smiled.
There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s moral outburst over Mr.
Eager.
It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine.
He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not in muscular rant.
But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive.
After a moment, he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval.
He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.
He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.
The outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact.
Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I feel I could never live out of it.
When I’m in the country I feel the same about the country.
After all, I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who live amongst them must be the best.
It’s true that in nine cases out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything.
The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions.
Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town.
Do you feel that, Mrs. Honeychurch?” Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled.
She had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either.
Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics.
It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?” “‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?” “Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled spire.
Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church.
In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages.
Some great mansions were at hand, but they were hidden in the trees.
The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement, having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals.
“Albert” was inhabited.
His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace.
“Cissie” was to let.
Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically.
“Summer Street will never be the same again.” As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry.
Now we shall know.
Sir Harry, pull those things down at once!” Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I meant to.
I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss Flack.” “Am I not always right?
She ought to have gone before the contract was signed.
Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s time?” “But what can I do?” He lowered his voice.
“An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden.” “Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully.
He had had full warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory.
He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt.
Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper.
He ventured to differ, however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration.
Sir Harry hinted that a column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin.
He built his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage.
He had failed in his duties to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy landlord.
But it is such an awkward size.
It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.” Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them.
The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously.
“It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.” “Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly.
“That is exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong type of people.
The train service has improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind.
And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?” “Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate.
She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea.
How would you like spinsters?” “My dear Lucy, it would be splendid.
Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.
I heard from them last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.
I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people.
Mr. Beebe knows them, too.
May I tell them to write to you?” “Indeed you may!” he cried.
“Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
How delightful it is!
Extra facilities—please tell them they shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees.
Oh, the agents!
The appalling people they have sent me!
One woman, when I wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance.
As if one cares about that!
And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable.
And oh, the deceit!
I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week.
The deceit of the most promising people.
My dear Lucy, the deceit!” She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all.
I know the type.
Preserve me from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy.
It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down.” “I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very sad thing.” “The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil.
“I haven’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.” “Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.” “It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied.
“I oughtn’t to come with my troubles to young people.
But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no real help.” “Then may I write to my Misses Alan?” “Please!” But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed: “Beware!
They are certain to have canaries.
Sir Harry, beware of canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come.
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.” “Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
If they get drunk, there’s an end of them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off.
If they’re vulgar, they somehow keep it to themselves.
It doesn’t spread so.
Give me a man—of course, provided he’s clean.” Sir Harry blushed.
Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex.
Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction.
He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself.
She was delighted.
Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house.
Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?” “Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.
He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha!
young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!” “I can’t help it.
It would be wrong not to loathe that man.” “He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.” “No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life.
In London he would keep his place.
He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife would give brainless dinner parties.
But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and every one—even your mother—is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt discouraged.
“I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.” “It matters supremely.
Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!
How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
with his bald head and retreating chin!
But let’s forget him.” This Lucy was glad enough to do.
If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape?
For instance, Freddy.
Freddy was neither clever, nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”?
And what would she reply?
Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety enough.
She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps, during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them.
Summer Street lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
“Why is it, Lucy, that you always say the road?
Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?” “Haven’t I?
The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with me in a room.” “A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes.
Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road.
Never in the real country like this.” “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
I have never felt anything of the sort.
You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.” “I don’t know that you aren’t.
I connect you with a view—a certain type of view.
Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?” She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing: “Do you know that you’re right?
I do.
I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room.
How funny!” To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray?
With no view?” “Yes, with no view, I fancy.
Why not?” “I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open air.” She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?” As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees.
She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!” “Why do you call it that?” “I can’t remember why.
I suppose it comes out of some book.
It’s only a puddle now, but you see that stream going through it?
Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful.
Then Freddy used to bathe there.
He is very fond of it.” “And you?” He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed here, too, till I was found out.
Then there was a row.” At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of prudishness within him.
But now?
with his momentary cult of the fresh air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity.
He looked at her as she stood by the pool’s edge.
She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?” “Charlotte,” she murmured.
“She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.” “Poor girl!” She smiled gravely.
A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
“What, Cecil?” “Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me—” He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed.
His courage had gone.
“Yes?” “Up to now I have never kissed you.” She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?” “Of course, you may, Cecil.
You might before.
I can’t run at you, you know.” At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities.
Her reply was inadequate.
She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil.
As he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them.
Such was the embrace.
He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure.
Passion should believe itself irresistible.
It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young man behind the counter would have done?
He recast the scene.
Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness.
For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation.
He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts.
At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.” “What name?” “The old man’s.” “What old man?” “That old man I told you about.
The one Mr.
Eager was so unkind to.” He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had.
Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to.
Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself.
Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs.
Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy.
He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility.
“I cannot think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter.
When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.
The best obtainable.
Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles.
A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia.
Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes.
In this circle, one thought, married, and died.
Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills.
But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high.
You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you.
She returned with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation.
He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad.
He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
Nor did he realize a more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her.
A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved.
For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.” “But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe.
“I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably.
They are coming.
I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried.
“Just because they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing.
And poor Lucy—serve her right—worn to a shadow.” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court.
Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn.
When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring.
“If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count.
I told you not Saturn.” “Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.” “Saturn doesn’t bounce.” “Saturn bounces enough.” “No, he doesn’t.” “Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.” “Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in.
That’s right, Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over the shins!” Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness.
Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt.
He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
But he hated the physical violence of the young.
How right it was!
Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.” “That wasn’t the name—” Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.” “Nonsense, Freddy!
You know nothing about it.” “Nonsense yourself!
I’ve this minute seen him.
He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem!
ahem!
I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’ and slapped him on the back.” “Exactly.
The Miss Alans?” “Rather not.
More like Anderson.” “Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed.
“Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right?
I _said_ don’t interfere with Cissie Villa.
I’m always right.
I’m quite uneasy at being always right so often.” “It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s.
Freddy doesn’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.” “Yes, I do.
I’ve got it.
Emerson.” “What name?” “Emerson.
I’ll bet you anything you like.” “What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly.
“I wish I had never bothered over it at all.” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky.
Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy?
Do you know what Emersons they are?” “I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was democratic.
Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person.
All right, Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother’s a snob.
But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s affectation to pretend there isn’t.” “Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways.
Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man.
Pray, does that satisfy you?” “Oh, yes,” he grumbled.
“And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety.” “_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly.
“Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.” “But has Cecil—” “Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’” She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much.
While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl.
She might well “screech” when she heard that it came partly from her lover.
Mr. Vyse was a tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people.
The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
He diverted it as follows: “The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean?
No, I don’t suppose it will prove to be them.
It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse’s.
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people!
The queerest people!
For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets.
They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa.
Poor little ladies!
So shocked and so pleased.
It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories.
‘My dear sister loves flowers,’ it began.
They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult.
Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets.” “Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister’s face was very red.
She could not recover herself.
Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature—pessimism, et cetera.
Our special joy was the father—such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.
He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Lucy, don’t desert us—go on playing bumble-puppy.
Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place.
That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being there.
Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop?
By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time.” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer.
He suggested that his hostess was mistaken.
At the hint of opposition she warmed.
She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told.
The name escaped her.
What was the name?
Oh, what was the name?
She clasped her knees for the name.
Something in Thackeray.
She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely.
“Don’t be silly.
You always overdo it when you play.” As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
Hitherto truth had come to her naturally.
She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely truthful?
Well, at all events, she must not tell lies.
She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame.
A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.
“Cecil!” “Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window.
He seemed in high spirits.
“I was hoping you’d come.
I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse.
George Meredith’s right—the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa.
Don’t be angry!
Don’t be angry!
You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.” He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said.
“Freddy has told us.
Naughty Cecil!
I suppose I must forgive you.
Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have nice friends of yours.
But you oughtn’t to tease one so.” “Friends of mine?” he laughed.
“But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was.
“Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week.” “What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously.
“I don’t quite understand.” “In the Umbrian Room.
Absolute strangers.
They were admiring Luca Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly.
However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not a little.
They had been to Italy.” “But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends.
I thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—” “Cecil!
No, it’s not fair.
I’ve probably met them before—” He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair.
Anything is fair that punishes a snob.
That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good.
Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with me.
There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things.
I believe in democracy—” “No, you don’t,” she snapped.
“You don’t know what the word means.” He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque.
“No, you don’t!” Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil.
I blame you—I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous.
You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense?
I consider it most disloyal of you.” She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness.
As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded.
He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally.
He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent.
In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse.
His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch.
Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement, met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned.
The Miss Alans were duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held responsible for the failure.
Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived.
Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood.
And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood.
Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood.
But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done.
She was glad that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative.
He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy.
At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do!
I don’t know what I should do without you.” Several days passed.
Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett.
A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not corresponded since they parted in August.
The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased amazingly.
For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical.
Charlotte, unselfish in the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue their tour.
Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs.
Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly.
Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS, “_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA, “I have news of you at last!
Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome.
Puncturing her tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out.
He said his father had just taken the house.
He _said_ he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (?).
He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea.
Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him to enter the house, etc.
That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you have told them already.
Mr. Vyse is so sensitive.
I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome.
I am very sorry about it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me, “Your anxious and loving cousin, “CHARLOTTE.” Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows: “BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE, “Many thanks for your warning.
When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she would blame you for not being always with me.
I have kept that promise, and cannot possibly tell her now.
I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself.
She should have tried at the Rectory.
I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage.
You must see that it would be too absurd.
If the Emersons heard I had complained of them, they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they are not.
I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy Corner at all, but here.
Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your envelope again.
No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately, “L.
M. HONEYCHURCH.” Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not.
Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at?
Miss Bartlett suggested the former.
Perhaps she was right.
It had become a great thing now.
Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago.
She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school.
But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.
It did her no harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors.
The weather was cool, and it did her no harm.
In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people.
The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.
One was tired of everything, it seemed.
One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter.
In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann.
“Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the querulous beauty of the music had died.
She shook her head and played Schumann again.
The melody rose, unprofitably magical.
It broke; it was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave.
The sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of the audience throb.
Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s, had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among many people.
The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.” “Her music always was wonderful.” “Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean.
She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.” “Italy has done it.” “Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her.
“It is just possible.
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.” “But her music!” he exclaimed.
“The style of her!
How she kept to Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schumann was right for this evening.
Schumann was the thing.
Do you know, mother, I shall have our children educated just like Lucy.
Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then—not till then—let them come to London.
I don’t believe in these London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.” “Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s room.
Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself.
She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.” “Bad dreams?” “Just dreams.” The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You should have heard us talking about you, dear.
He admires you more than ever.
Dream of that.” Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed.
Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed.
As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.” “M’m.” “They might amuse you.” Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe.
“They are worth it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
“Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!” “I’ve brought someone to see you.” “I’ll be down in a minute.” The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered.
“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment.
What have they got?
Byron.
Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad.
Never heard of it.
The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it.
Gibbon.
Hullo!
dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.” “Mr.
Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.” “I know.
Isn’t it jolly?
I like that.
I’m certain that’s the old man’s doing.” “How very odd of him!” “Surely you agree?” But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.” “The same as Lucy’s got.” “Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?” “She came back yesterday.” “I suppose she had a good time?” “Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book.
“She and Cecil are thicker than ever.” “That’s good hearing.” “I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.” Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks.
She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books.
Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
Cecil says—” “What on earth are those people doing upstairs?
Emerson—we think we’ll come another time.” George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.” Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face wanted washing.
At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe.” “Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do?
how d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard.
But I’m afraid it will only act between men.
Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How do you do?
Come and have a bathe’?
And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.” “I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.
I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.” “We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you place in the past, is really yet to come.
We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.” Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead.
We despise the body less than women do.
But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.” “I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once.
But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
It is our heritage.” “Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.” “How do you do?
Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty.
I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He has been most kind.
He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
Ah, this wind!
You do well to bathe.
Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!” “Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy.
“I must—that is to say, I have to—have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.” “_Call_, my lad?
Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
Call on your grandmother!
Listen to the wind among the pines!
Yours is a glorious country.” Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr.
Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval.
It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, George.
Why do you dawdle talking?
Bring them back to tea.
Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his office.
I can’t believe he’s well.” George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him.
“It is only a pond, don’t you know.
I dare say you are used to something better.” “Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.” Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
How glorious it was!
For a little time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
He spoke of Florence.
George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse!
Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?” “I did not.
Miss Lavish told me.” “When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of Coincidence.’” No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.” To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is.
I have reflected.
It is Fate.
Everything is Fate.
We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart.
The twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—” “You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman.
“Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
Don’t say, ‘I didn’t do this,’ for you did it, ten to one.
Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?” “Italy.” “And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?” “National Gallery.” “Looking at Italian art.
There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.” “It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George.
“But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.” Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is still to write.” Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that you have come.” Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond.
I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe.
“No apologies are necessary for the pond.” George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid?
I love willow-herb in seed.
What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
Very charming, very charming.” “Mr.
Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George.
Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
It was necessary to use his muscles.
It was necessary to keep clean.
Mr. Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful, water’s simply ripping.” “Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful.
Mr. Beebe, do.” “Apooshoo, kouf.” Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
How glorious it was!
The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Götterdämmerung.
But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
They began to play.
Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
A little deferentially, they splashed George.
He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: “No.
We are what matters.
Without us shall no enterprise begin.
To us shall all flesh turn in the end.” “A try!
A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a kick.
“Goal!” “Goal!” “Pass!” “Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat!
No, that’s enough, Freddy.
Dress now.
No, I say!” But the two young men were delirious.
Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
“Hi!
Steady on!
I see people coming you fellows!” Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi!
hi!
_Ladies!_” Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
Still, they did not hear Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Whoever were those unfortunate people?
Oh, dears, look away!
And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?” “Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
Cecil, Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—” No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently “minded.” “I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.” “This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.” They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
“I can’t be trodden on, can I?” “Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you!
What miserable management!
Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?” “Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and if another fellow—” “Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
Come, Lucy.” They turned.
“Oh, look—don’t look!
Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
How unfortunate again—” For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken.
“I’ve swallowed a pollywog.
It wriggleth in my tummy.
I shall die—Emerson you beast, you’ve got on my bags.” “Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
“And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.” “Mother, do come away,” said Lucy.
“Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.” “Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed.
Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called: “Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
Hullo!” “Bow, Lucy; better bow.
Whoever is it?
I shall bow.” Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away.
On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for youth.
Chapter XIII How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview!
But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume.
Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent.
She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life.
A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much.
“I will bow,” she had thought.
“I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom?
To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.
It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.
Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and he did not want to be seen.
He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside.
He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done.
Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock.
Miss Bartlett, indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory.
Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with Cecil?” The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.” “Perhaps he’s tired.” Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.” “I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.” “Cecil has told you to think so.
You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.” “Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?” “Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?” “Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble ahead.
“It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him sometimes seem—” “Oh, rubbish!
If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother!
I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!” “Not in that way.
At times I could wring her neck.
But not in that way.
No.
It is the same with Cecil all over.” “By-the-by—I never told you.
I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London.” This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me.
No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.” “I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to.
But he does not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.” “Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?” “You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.” “Then why didn’t he leave the room?
Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone’s pleasure?” “We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy.
Something had enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form.
The two civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes.
Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he had succeeded.
And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother—” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
Go.” She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window.
It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.
Now, as in the winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes.
One connected the landing window with depression.
No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly.
And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.
She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.” “My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been!
You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public.
It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else.
Do be more careful.
You forget the place is growing half suburban.” “I say, is anything on to-morrow week?” “Not that I know of.” “Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.” “Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.” “What’s wrong with the court?
They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered new balls.” “I meant _it’s_ better not.
I really mean it.” He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper.
Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans.
Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making!
I have something to say to you.
Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes.
I really can’t stop.
I must dress too.” “How’s Charlotte?” “All right.” “Lucy!” The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?” “Her _what?_” “Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?” “I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly.
“I shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.” Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out.
She did not.
She said: “Come here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life.
It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil.
Cecil despised their methods—perhaps rightly.
At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven.
Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
Then Freddy said: “Lucy, what’s Emerson like?” “I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?” “Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.” “He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly.
I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.” “Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter.” “One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie.
“Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.” “Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.” “She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily.
The remark was a happy one, for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print.
Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath.
But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness.
There were too many ghosts about.
The original ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr.
Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes.
It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s.
How is she?” “I tore the thing up.” “Didn’t she say how she was?
How does she sound?
Cheerful?” “Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.” “Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler.
I know myself how water preys upon one’s mind.
I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the meat.” Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish.
I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long.” It was more than her nerves could stand.
And she could not protest violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded.
“It’s impossible.
We can’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is.
Freddy’s got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare.
It simply can’t be done.” “Nonsense!
It can.” “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
Not otherwise.” “Minnie can sleep with you.” “I won’t have her.” “Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.” “Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy.
“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.” “No, I don’t.
And no more does Cecil.
She gets on our nerves.
You haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good.
So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come.” “Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two.
You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers.
You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.” Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike,” put in Freddy.
“She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.” “I know, dear.
She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return.” But Lucy hardened her heart.
It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She had tried herself too often and too recently.
One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth.
She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother.
I don’t like Charlotte.
I admit it’s horrid of me.” “From your own account, you told her as much.” “Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
She flurried—” The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the places she had known as a child.
The Sacred Lake would never be the same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner.
How would she fight against ghosts?
For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care for eggs.
I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.” Cecil frowned again.
Oh, these Honeychurches!
Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact.
“May me and Lucy get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.” Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room—something with no view, anything.
Her love to Lucy.
And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
She never gazed inwards.
If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
She was nervous at night.
When she talked to George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
Once she had suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious.
Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
She loved Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
Standing between Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his crudities in time.
I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.” Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits.
He laughs more.” “Yes,” replied the clergyman.
“He is waking up.” That was all.
But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs. Honeychurch drove to meet her.
She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“I have upset everything.
Bursting in on young people!
But I insist on paying for my cab up.
Grant that, at any rate.” “Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.” “I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather.
Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.” Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
Only sovereigns and pennies.
Could any one give her change?
Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But who am I to give the sovereign to?” “Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.” Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid.
A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
I should practically be robbing the one who lost.” “Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil.
“So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.” “Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
“How is that, Mr. Vyse?” “Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab.
Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.” Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy.
He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
“I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid.” “Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.” “But I don’t see—” They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you.
I’m done.
I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me.
Ow!
What about Mr. Floyd’s ten shillings?
Ow!
No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.” “I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
“Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
A shilling was it?
Can any one give me change for half a crown?” “I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign.
No, give me up that sovereign.
I’ll get Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning.” “Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?” “No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
“Let me see—a sovereign’s worth of silver.” She escaped into the kitchen.
Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were too uncanny.
It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t.
Here is your money—all shillings, except two half-crowns.
Would you count it?
You can settle your debt nicely now.” Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source.” “Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle.
“George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?” Miss Bartlett considered.
“For instance, the driver.
I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.” Lucy shuddered a little.
“We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren’t careful.
How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?” “We must think of every possibility.” “Oh, it’s all right.” “Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows.
In fact, he is certain to know.” “I don’t care if he does.
I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.” “To contradict it?” “No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best.
Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
Ladies are certainly different.” “Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully.
“You kind, anxious thing.
What _would_ you have me do?
First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say, ‘Tell’.
Which is it to be?
Quick!” Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest.
I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
You will never forgive me.” “Shall we go out, then.
They will smash all the china if we don’t.” For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again.
Have you seen the young one yet?” “Yes, I have.” “What happened?” “We met at the Rectory.” “What line is he taking up?” “No line.
He talked about Italy, like any other person.
It is really all right.
What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way.
He really won’t be any nuisance, Charlotte.” “Once a cad, always a cad.
That is my poor opinion.” Lucy paused.
“Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
It was a new one from Smith’s library.
Her mother must have returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
I don’t think we ought to blame him very much.
It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
He has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into tears.
He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big railways—not a porter!
and runs down to his father for week-ends.
Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
There!
Now for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm.
“Suppose we don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.” Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
Explanations took place, and in the midst of them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain.
Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most of the days of that year.
In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold.
Up on the heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.
Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path.
From the house came incoherent sounds, as of females preparing for worship.
“The men say they won’t go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her, no nonsense”—“Anne!
Mary!
Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine.
Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously.
The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender shadow.
But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window.
Her new cerise dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan.
At her throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an engagement ring.
Her eyes are bent to the Weald.
She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.
In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills.
“Lucy!
Lucy!
What’s that book?
Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?” “It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.” “But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.” Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a Loggia.
She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up.
It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil had said, “What!
you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?” She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.
I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child?
Minnie!
That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!)
Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late.
Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse, never the carriage.
“Where’s Charlotte?
Run up and hurry her.
Why is she so long?
She had nothing to do.
She never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses!
Minnie!” Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting.
As usual, she didn’t see why.
Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men?
The young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words.
Mrs. Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but sovereigns and half crowns.
Could any one give me—” “Yes, easily.
Jump in.
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock!
You put us all to shame.” “If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully.
She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse.
The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
“Good-bye!
Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering.
On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation.
He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.
All that he said on this subject pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church.
There was a line of carriages down the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa.
To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother.
“Unless the young man considers that he knows me already.” He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally.
Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how glad he was that she was going to be married.
She said yes, she was glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice; she had never known him offended before.
He added: “We find, though, that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing.
I am very much upset about it.” “I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,” said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further.
“He thought we should be artistic.
He is disappointed.” “And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up.
What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly.
She must avoid censuring Cecil.
For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned, though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says.
He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall.
Yet it does seem so unkind.” “There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“That’s exactly what I say.
Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?” “There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,” he continued in measured tones.
“We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.
Choose a place where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!” “Eh—?” “I see you’re going to be clever.
I hope you didn’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy.” George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
“He behaved that way to me.
It is his philosophy.
Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first.” “What _do_ you mean?
No, never mind what you mean.
Don’t explain.
He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
Do you play tennis?
Do you mind tennis on Sunday—?” “George mind tennis on Sunday!
George, after his education, distinguish between Sunday—” “Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.
No more do I. That’s settled.
Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased.” He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans.” “I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck.
The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the morning sun?
She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.” “Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady.
Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow.
It was the pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow.
Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered.
He said: “I—I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house.
Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them.
“George has been in such good spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.” Lucy caught her cousin’s eye.
Something in its mute appeal made her reckless.
“Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven.
Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy.
All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things.
It was not an exploit.
He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her hand to her cheek.
“He does not love me.
No.
How terrible if he did!
But he has not told.
He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right.
It’s a secret between us two for ever.
Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room.
The secret, big or little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world.
Thus she interpreted her joy.
She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so safe.
As he helped her out of the carriage, she said: “The Emersons have been so nice.
George Emerson has improved enormously.” “How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them, and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth.
For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected.
He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are.
George Emerson is coming up this afternoon.
He is a most interesting man to talk to.
Only don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks.
Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal.
Generally Lucy was depressed at meals.
Some one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will not last, this cheerfulness.
In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee.
Her mother would always sit there, her brother here.
The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would never be hidden behind the western hills.
After luncheon they asked her to play.
She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.
Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.” She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round.
There George was.
He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
Cecil should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson.
Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.
She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano.
“I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.” “Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil.
“I will not spoil the set.” He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil.
I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s Emerson.” George corrected him: “I am not bad.” One looked down one’s nose at this.
“Then certainly I won’t play,” said Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse.
You had much better not play.
Much better not.” Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would play.
“I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall back on Lucy.
There is no other way out of it.
Lucy, go and change your frock.” Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature.
She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon.
As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner.
She liked music, but how much better tennis seemed.
How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms.
Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child.
George served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
The hills stood out above its radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara.
She might be forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her.
He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others.
He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke.
When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.” “What fun, Cecil!
Read away.
Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!” “Do you mind being beaten?” She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a splendid player, though.
The light was behind you, and it was in my eyes.” “I never said I was.” “Why, you did!” “You didn’t attend.” “You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house.
We all exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.” “‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset.
Leonora was speeding—’” Lucy interrupted.
“Leonora?
Is Leonora the heroine?
Who’s the book by?” “Joseph Emery Prank.
‘Sunset.
Leonora speeding across the square.
Pray the saints she might not arrive too late.
Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it now—’” Lucy burst into laughter.
“‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed!
Why it’s Miss Lavish!
It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under somebody else’s name.” “Who may Miss Lavish be?” “Oh, a dreadful person—Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?” Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up.
“Of course I do.
I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street.
It was she who told me that you lived here.” “Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean something else.
She watched his head, which was almost resting against her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening.
“No wonder the novel’s bad,” she added.
“I never liked Miss Lavish.
But I suppose one ought to read it as one’s met her.” “All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature.
“Every one writes for money in these days.” “Oh, Cecil—!” “It is so.
I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow.
The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her.
She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?” “I never notice much difference in views.” “What do you mean?” “Because they’re all alike.
Because all that matters in them is distance and air.” “H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.” “I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up.
Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.” He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured.
“I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again.
I’m so sorry he’s not so well.” “No, he isn’t well.” “There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil.
“Also that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.” “Mr.
Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?” “None.
Why?” “You spoke of ‘us.’” “My mother, I was meaning.” Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!” “I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” “I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.
It is the first thing that I remember.” Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after tennis—he didn’t do.
He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.” “Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.” “No—read away.
I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud.
If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.” This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him.
It put their visitor in the position of a prig.
Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr.
Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book.
Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked.
But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning.
“Find me chapter two, if it isn’t bothering you.” Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.” She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.” He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone.
Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village.
The season was spring.’” Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose, for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read.
He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence, while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets.
All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’” Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use.
No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’” “This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last.
She thought a disaster was averted.
But when they entered the shrubbery it came.
The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring.
That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove.
Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I must write some letters,” and went up to her room.
Then she prepared for action.
Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty.
Perhaps there never is such a contest.
It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first aim was to defeat herself.
As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been.
Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him.
The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.
In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
“Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?” Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.
“There is a scene in it.
The hero and heroine make love.
Do you know about that?” “Dear—?” “Do you know about it, please?” she repeated.
“They are on a hillside, and Florence is in the distance.” “My good Lucia, I am all at sea.
I know nothing about it whatever.” “There are violets.
I cannot believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her?
I have thought before speaking; it _must_ be you.” “Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.” Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved.
“Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t put that in her book?” Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it.
Yes.” “Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” “So you did tell?” “I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of conversation—” “But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell mother?” “I will never forgive Eleanor.
She has betrayed my confidence.” “Why did you tell her, though?
This is a most serious thing.” Why does any one tell anything?
The question is eternal, and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response.
She had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again.
Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes?
Behind Cecil’s back as we were walking up the garden.” Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now?
Can you tell me?” “Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day.
Fancy if your prospects—” “I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word.
“I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.” It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince.
“However,” said the girl, despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done.
You have put me in a most awkward position.
How am I to get out of it?” Miss Bartlett could not think.
The days of her energy were over.
She was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that.
She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him?
I can’t tell mother now—owing to you.
Nor Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you.
I am caught up every way.
I think I shall go mad.
I have no one to help me.
That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.” Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing.
What’s to be _done?_ We women go maundering on.
What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?” “I always said he was a cad, dear.
Give me credit for that, at all events.
From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a bath.” “Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong!
We’ve both made a muddle of it.
George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he to be left unpunished, or isn’t he?
I want to know.” Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless.
Her own exposure had unnerved her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain.
She moved feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?” “Willingly would I move heaven and earth—” “I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously.
“Will you speak to him?
It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word.” “Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.” “It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture.
“No one will help me.
I will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below.
“Found the lost ball?
Good man!
Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you!
I admire you—” They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul.
Her anger faded at the sight of him.
Ah!
The Emersons were fine people in their way.
She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying: “Freddy has taken him into the dining-room.
The others are going down the garden.
Come.
Let us get this over quickly.
Come.
I want you in the room, of course.” “Lucy, do you mind doing it?” “How can you ask such a ridiculous question?” “Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand.
“I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded.
She remembered their last evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss Bartlett’s toque on the door.
She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time.
Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying.
“The jam’s jolly good.” George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room.
As she entered he stopped, and said: “No—nothing to eat.” “You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants.
Where’s mother?” “She’s started on her Sunday writing.
She’s in the drawing-room.” “That’s all right.
You go away.” He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table.
Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech.
She just said: “I can’t have it, Mr. Emerson.
I cannot even talk to you.
Go out of this house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door.
“I hate a row.
Go please.” “What—” “No discussion.” “But I can’t—” She shook her head.
“Go, please.
I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.” “You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t mean that you are going to marry that man?” The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her.
“You are merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse.
He’s only for an acquaintance.
He is for society and cultivated talk.
He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.” It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss—” “No, but have you ever?
He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.
It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.
I would never have let myself go.
But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters.
Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.
That is the man all over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find.
Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to settle whether you were shocked or no.
Cecil all over again.
He daren’t let a woman decide.
He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.
Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon.
Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’ because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control.
I’m not ashamed.
I don’t apologize.
But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you.
Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly?
But therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.” Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson.
Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.” And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality.
He said: “Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary.
“I’m the same kind of brute at bottom.
This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He thought.
“Yes—really in a better way.
I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards her.
“Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain.
I have cared for you since that man died.
I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun.
As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered.
I called.
I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.” “And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm.
“Does he not matter?
That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly?
A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?” He said: “It is our last chance.
I shall do all that I can.” And as if he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening.
“You wouldn’t stop us this second time if you understood,” he said.
“I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.” Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though demolishing some invisible obstacle.
She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
“It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really.
It is that love and youth matter intellectually.” In silence the two women watched him.
His last remark, they knew, was nonsense, but was he going after it or not?
Would not he, the cad, the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish?
No.
He was apparently content.
He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house.
Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!” Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet.
“Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the latter.
One more fuss through with you, Charlotte.
Many thanks.
I think, though, that this is the last.
My admirer will hardly trouble me again.” And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish: “Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it?
Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really.
It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.” “Let’s go down to them.” But, once in the open air, she paused.
Some emotion—pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring.
That something or other mattered intellectually?
A leaf, violently agitated, danced past her, while other leaves lay motionless.
That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy!
There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll hurry.” “Mr.
Emerson has had to go.” “What a nuisance!
That spoils the four.
I say, Cecil, do play, do, there’s a good chap.
It’s Floyd’s last day.
Do play tennis with us, just this once.” Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete.
As you well remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you.” The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes.
How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement.
Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered.
He had nothing to say.
He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things over.
We are too different.
I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.” It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—” “I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
“My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.” “I don’t understand you.
You aren’t like yourself.
You’re tired, Lucy.” “Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once.
“That is exactly like you.
You always think women don’t mean what they say.” “Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.” “What if I do?
It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth.
I can’t marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.” “You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches.
But give me a moment’s time.” He closed his eyes.
“You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.” It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
To bring on the crisis, she said: “There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.” “I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never could play.
I don’t understand a word you say.” “You can play well enough to make up a four.
I thought it abominably selfish of you.” “No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis.
Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
You talked of our wedding at lunch—at least, you let me talk.” “I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly.
“I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
Of course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.” She developed this position.
“Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted to be my husband?
I don’t think so.
You don’t like Freddy, nor my mother.
There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point.
They have to-day.
I see clearly.
I must speak.
That’s all.” “I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently.
“I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
It’s all too horrible.” “What’s the good of a scene?” “No good.
But surely I have a right to hear a little more.” He put down his glass and opened the window.
From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy or any one might be outside.” He obeyed.
“I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved me!” “I did not,” she said.
“I thought I did at first.
I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.” He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
She had counted on his being petty.
It would have made things easier for her.
By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently.
I dare say you are right not to.
But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.” “Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort who can’t know any one intimately.” A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that.
But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
It is that, more or less.
When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always protecting me.” Her voice swelled.
“I won’t be protected.
I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
To shield me is an insult.
Can’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
A woman’s place!
You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
That’s why I break off my engagement.
You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause.
Then Cecil said with great emotion: “It is true.” “True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word.
It is a revelation.
It is—I.” “Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.” He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true.
I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
You are even greater than I thought.” She withdrew a step.
“I’m not going to worry you.
You are far too good to me.
I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
I have never known you till this evening.
I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—” “What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance.
She cried: “If you think I am in love with some one else, you are very much mistaken.” “Of course I don’t think that.
You are not that kind, Lucy.” “Oh, yes, you do think it.
It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting, brutal!
As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.” He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past.
I shall never say it again.
You have taught me better.” She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity.
I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.” “All right, Cecil, that will do.
Don’t apologize to me.
It was my mistake.” “It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke.
“I must actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really am.
Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
Will you shake hands?” “Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
“Good-night, Cecil.
Good-bye.
That’s all right.
I’m sorry about it.
Thank you very much for your gentleness.” “Let me light your candle, shall I?” They went into the hall.
“Thank you.
Good-night again.
God bless you, Lucy!” “Good-bye, Cecil.” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry.
In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself.
She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within.
They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
As the years pass, they are censured.
Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one.
The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill.
On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy Corner,—he laughed.
The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.
The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road.
So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly.
Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.
One might laugh at the house, but one never shuddered.
Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip.
He had heard from the Miss Alans.
These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed their plans.
They were going to Greece instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter.
Of course, Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train.
But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.” Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her.
She would see the fun of it, and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty.
Though she was hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she could not play the piano as she did.
He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been understood.
This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been illustrated by facts.
Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.
Therefore it must be the horse, who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy.
They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs.
Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station.
They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it.
“Isn’t it wonderful?
Isn’t it romance?
Most certainly they will go to Constantinople.
They are taken in a snare that cannot fail.
They will end by going round the world.” Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious!
I never notice it in you young people; you do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing.
‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn!
No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans.
They want the Pension Keats.” “I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you any matches?” “I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?” “Never.” “Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit.
I haven’t been to Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my friends going.
It is altogether too big for our little lot.
Don’t you think so?
Italy is just about as much as we can manage.
Italy is heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus.
All right, Freddy—I am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
“I was saying, if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience.
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me.
There the contrast is just as much as I can realize.
But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the victoria.” “You’re quite right,” said Cecil.
“Greece is not for our little lot”; and he got in.
Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really.
And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box, which had not been returned.
As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
Cecil’s hard hit.
Lucy won’t marry him.
If you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down.” “But when—” “Late last night.
I must go.” “Perhaps they won’t want me down there.” “No—go on.
Good-bye.” “Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart.
The house was again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata.
He hesitated a moment, but went down the garden as requested.
There he found a mournful company.
It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of assistance.
At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe?
Gracious what a mess everything is!
Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.” Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her.
“You have worried them as much as they can stand.
Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly.
I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.” “Oh, must you?
Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it.” Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about for, either in the house or out of it.” Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.
As they walked up the garden, the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother.
Or will she come with us?” “I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.” “They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has gone, and Freddy won’t play with me.
In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.” “Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur.
“Go and put on your boots.” He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart.
She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do?
Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive.
Would you come too?” “I don’t think I will, thank you.” “No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.” Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!” “Yes.” “I met them on the hill.
Your brother told me.” “Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed.
Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.” “Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have done the right thing.” “So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.” “I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.” “So does mother.
Mother minds dreadfully.” “I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.
It was really a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.” “Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he?
I gathered that he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.” “Boys are so odd.” Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor.
Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel.
Mr. Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action, so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan.
That was really what brought me over.
I thought it might amuse you all.” “How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.
After a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with “Going abroad?
When do they start?” “Next week, I gather.” “Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
Always complaisant, he put the letter away.
But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!
How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad!” “I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast!” She laughed heartily.
“Oh, delightful!
I wish they’d take me.” “Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel?
Perhaps George Emerson is right.
He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’” “Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople.
I have always longed to go to Constantinople.
Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?” Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm.
She had always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed.
He saw, to his surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends, after Cissie Villa.” “Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would give anything to go with them.” “Would your mother spare you again so soon?
You have scarcely been home three months.” “She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement.
“I simply _must_ go away.
I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
“Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away?
I didn’t realize at the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.” “You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—” “Yes, yes.
I knew you’d understand.” Mr. Beebe did not quite understand.
Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family?
Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her.
Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying.
He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down.” “I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all.
Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so masterful.
I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
He would improve me in places where I can’t be improved.
Cecil won’t let a woman decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t.
What nonsense I do talk!
But that is the kind of thing.” “It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you.
I do sympathize and agree most profoundly.
I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?” “But I must go somewhere!” she cried.
“I have been worrying all the morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with clenched fists, and repeated: “I must!
And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
You all think much too highly of me.
I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased.
“I must get away, ever so far.
I must know my own mind and where I want to go.” “Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out of the front-door.
He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource.
She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be.
I know all about it.
The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak.” Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett.
As he had put it to himself at Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
He assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter drop.” “I wonder.” “It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street.
It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at the present moment.” Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows.
Death is a strong word—surely too strong.
There was no question of tragedy.
He said: “Of course, Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she chooses.
Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.” “I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly.
“Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you.
One cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy.
A chance word to a chattering friend, and—” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
A rector lives in a web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he will regard them.
He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately?
I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish.
It is odd how we of that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another’s lives.
Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.
We must really give the Signora a testimonial.” And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern.
On the summit they paused.
The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue.
Summer was retreating.
The wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven.
The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery.
Mr. Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.” They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.
That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably.
Mr. Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces.
They would hand the child her food through the window.
Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past.
I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit.
She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her.
But the future.
Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again.
“I don’t know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.” Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.” To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you.
In it I spy Lucy’s salvation.” “Really.
Now, why?” “She wanted to leave Windy Corner.” “I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to say—selfish.” “It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire a change.” Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect misses.
Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced.
Perhaps she must have a change.
I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand these things.
But why need she go as far as Greece?” “You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner.
“Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?)
Why not Tunbridge Wells?
Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning.
I cannot help her.
I will say no more.
Perhaps I have already said too much.
I am not to talk.
I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.” Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance.
I know too well that I get on Lucy’s nerves.
Our tour was a failure.
She wanted to leave Florence, and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.” “Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe.
“I want your advice.” “Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to him, though familiar to Lucy.
“I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?” Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd woman really did know.
“She must not stop here a moment, and we must keep quiet till she goes.
I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already.
Only, Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone.
If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—” “Otherwise—?” “Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.” Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude.
The tavern sign—a beehive trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him.
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another man” that would have attracted a grosser mind.
He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form.
Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry.
His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.
“They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure.
In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity.
The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement.
Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the action of others.
The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey.
He conversed on indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants; Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could literature influence life?
Windy Corner glimmered.
In the garden, Mrs. Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly.
“This comes of putting off.
We might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece.
I don’t know what the world’s coming to.” “Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must.
Come up to the house and let’s talk it over.
Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?” “Mr.
Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.” “So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good.
Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone.
It was expensive and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed.
Nor would Charlotte have succeeded.
The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right.
It must be something I can’t understand.
Lucy!
Let’s tell her.
Lucy!” “She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said.
He opened the door, and heard the words of a song: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.” “I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.” “Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——” “It’s a song that Cecil gave her.
How odd girls are!” “What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly.
She went into the drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.” Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a bit.” “And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you.” “Oh, splendid!
Oh, thank you!” Mr. Beebe followed.
Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys.
She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness.
Her mother bent over her.
Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_, in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and therefore ignored by the art of to-day.
Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens,” she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.” “Mr.
Beebe knows my rude ways.” “It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he.
“Go on.” “It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly.
“I forget why—harmony or something.” “I suspected it was unscholarly.
It’s so beautiful.” “The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten.
Why throw up the sponge?” “How stupidly you talk!” said his sister.
The _Santa Conversazione_ was broken up.
After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.” “Stop thine ear against the singer—” “Wait a minute; she is finishing.” “From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” “I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear.
She had behaved splendidly, and he had helped her.
He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl’s life.
If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—” Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly.
He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned: “Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX Lying to Mr. Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial England.
They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books, mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.
Miss Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one’s face in the train.
Lucy promised, a little depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.
A gentleman is such a stand-by.” Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine continued.
“It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.
But perhaps he will come out and join you later on.” “Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off.
I do so long to see him.” “No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“She doesn’t like it.” “No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really?
How funny!
I should have thought that in this case—” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going?
It is such a pleasure to have met you!” They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right.
We just got through that time.” But her mother was annoyed.
“I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it.
There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.” Lucy had plenty to say in reply.
She described the Miss Alans’ character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?” “Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then.
It’s much pleasanter.
How wet it is!
Let’s turn in here.” “Here” was the British Museum.
Mrs. Honeychurch refused.
If they must take shelter, let it be in a shop.
Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.
Let’s go to Mudie’s.
I’ll buy a guide-book.” “You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this hole-and-corner work.
You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute.
But why not announce it?
Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?” “It’s only for a few days.” “But why at all?” Lucy was silent.
She was drifting away from her mother.
It was quite easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the incidental advantage of being true.
But she could not say it.
She disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors—Light.
Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent.
She was thinking, “My daughter won’t answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me.
Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.” This was perfectly true.
Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no longer.
It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.
She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk!
Of course I’m not tired of Windy Corner.” “Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?” She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.” “Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?” “Hush, mother!
People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s.
She bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
You see, I come into my money next year.” Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed “eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear.
“I’ve seen the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy.
I have seen so little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like to-day, but to stop.
I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl.” “And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police.
And call it a Mission—when no one wants you!
And call it Duty—when it means that you can’t stand your own home!
And call it Work—when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is!
And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.” “I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys.
But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well.
Take your independence and be gone.
Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.” Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed.
“How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!” “_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.
“More every moment.” “I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike.” “Well, I see the likeness.
The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters.” “What rubbish!
And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you asked her to stop.
I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.” Lucy clenched her teeth.
“My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked Charlotte to stop.
I wish you would keep to the point.” And the conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station.
It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy.
Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful.
“The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked.
For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old mother.
“We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining.
Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was blurred by the soft road.
“_Can’t_ we have the hood down?” she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck.
But now that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?” “It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?” “Yes, miss, they have gone.” Lucy sank back.
The carriage stopped at the Rectory.
She got out to call for Miss Bartlett.
So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary.
Waste!
That word seemed to sum up the whole of life.
Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded her mother.
Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible.
Other people had.
When the maid opened the door, she was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a great favour: might she go to church?
Mr. Beebe and his mother had already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily.
“I forgot it was Friday.
Let’s all go.
Powell can go round to the stables.” “Lucy dearest—” “No church for me, thank you.” A sigh, and they departed.
The church was invisible, but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour.
This was a stained window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation.
Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?
There was only that one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait, sir.” Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips.
George she had faced, and could have faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry!
George is so sorry!
He thought he had a right to try.
I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first.
He ought not to have tried.
I knew nothing about it at all.” If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand.
“But you must not scold him.” Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love.
I said: ‘When love comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind.
No.
Passion is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my day is over, and though there is the result.
Poor boy!
He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that whatever you felt you did not mean.
Yet”—his voice gathered strength: he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?” Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries.
Holding it up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son.” “But you do remember it?” “He has misbehaved himself from the first.” “I only was told that he loved you last Sunday.
I never could judge behaviour.
I—I—suppose he has.” Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to him.
His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said.
“I am glad he is sorry.
Do you know what he did?” “Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction.
“He only tried when he should not have tried.
You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are going to marry the man you love.
Do not go out of George’s life saying he is abominable.” “No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong.
I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all.
My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late—” “Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?” “Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.” “As his mother did.” “But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr.
Emerson_—what are you talking about?” “When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round.
She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered.
“Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in again!
A judgement!
And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church!
Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch?
Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever?” “I don’t know,” gasped Lucy.
“I don’t understand this sort of thing.
I was not meant to understand it.” “But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his principles.
I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was well she was ill.
He made her think about sin, and she went under thinking about it.” It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man.
“I did hold firm.” And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what cost!—he had won a victory over them.
“My boy shall go back to the earth untouched.” She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill. “Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present.
“George last Sunday—no, not ill: just gone under.
He is never ill.
But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
It was always touch and go.
He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live.
He will never think anything worth while.
You remember that church at Florence?” Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible.
Then we took the house here, and he goes bathing with your brother, and became better.
You saw him bathing?” “I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair.
I am deeply sorry about it.” “Then there came something about a novel.
I didn’t follow it at all; I had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old.
Ah, well, one must have failures.
George comes down to-morrow, and takes me up to his London rooms.
He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be where he is.” “Mr.
Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my account.
I am going to Greece.
Don’t leave your comfortable house.” It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled.
“How good everyone is!
And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning and heard I was going!
Here I am so comfortable with a fire.” “Yes, but you won’t go back to London.
It’s absurd.” “I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he can’t.
He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t.
I’ve been bother enough to the world by now.
I can’t have you moving out of your house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my account.
You must stop!
I am just going to Greece.” “All the way to Greece?” Her manner altered.
“To Greece?” “So you must stop.
You won’t talk about this business, I know.
I can trust you both.” “Certainly you can.
We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the life that you have chosen.” “I shouldn’t want—” “I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George?
No, it was wrong of George to try.
We have pushed our beliefs too far.
I fancy that we deserve sorrow.” She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling.
To Lucy who could not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still.
I think I will sit in the carriage.” “Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.” “Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you.
And what were you saying about going abroad?” She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands.
Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you.
I hope—it isn’t because George spoke that you are both going?” “No.” “I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.” “Thank you.” At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church.
His cassock was covered with rain.
“That’s all right,” he said kindly.
“I counted on you two keeping each other company.
It’s pouring again.
The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it.
Did Powell go round?” “I think so; I’ll see.” “No—of course, I’ll see.
How are the Miss Alans?” “Very well, thank you.” “Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?” “I—I did.” “Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the two Miss Alans?
Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm.
I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely.
“I made a slip.
Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England.” Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man.
To George, to Cecil, she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece.
And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving him?
You are leaving the man you love?” “I—I had to.” “Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?” Terror came over her, and she lied again.
She made the long, convincing speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more.
He heard her in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.
It seems to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.” She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world.
It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so dreadful.
It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the things that I might have avoided.
We can help one another but little.
I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle.
Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren’t?
Do you remember before, when you refused the room with the view?
Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent.
“Don’t trust me, Miss Honeychurch.
Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was still silent.
“‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’ I think he puts it well.
Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean.
You love George!” And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
“You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
You won’t marry the other man for his sake.” “How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man.” “But you are.” She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.
It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way.
You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat.
I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and _for which_ you marry.
I know that, with George, you will find them, and that you love him.
Then be his wife.
He is already part of you.
Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part.
You will wish that it was.
You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.
I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the body.
Ah!
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that!
Ah!
for a little directness to liberate the soul!
Your soul, dear Lucy!
I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round.
But we have souls.
I cannot say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining yours.
I cannot bear it.
It is again the darkness creeping in; it is hell.” Then he checked himself.
“What nonsense I have talked—how abstract and remote!
And I have made you cry!
Dear girl, forgive my prosiness; marry my boy.
When I think what life is, and how seldom love is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made.” She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.
Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
“Cecil—Mr.
Beebe—the ticket’s bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair.
“I’m caught in the tangle.
I must suffer and grow old away from him.
I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
They trusted me.” A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only.
Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—” “No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—” “But why should they, when you have deceived them?” Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.” “You’re not worthy of their trust.” “What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?” “One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson.
To whom do you refer?
Trust whom?” “I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George.
They have loved one another all along.” Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman.
A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?” “Mr.
Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—” “Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!” “It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly.
“It’s the part of people that you don’t understand.” Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy!
Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr.
Beebe, could you help me?” He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am more grieved than I can possibly express.
It is lamentable, lamentable—incredible.” “What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me.
Marry George, Miss Honeychurch.
He will do admirably.” He walked out and left them.
They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair.
But his face revived her.
It was the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark.
Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know.
But remember the mountains over Florence and the view.
Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise.
George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him.
Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.” “You kiss me,” said the girl.
“You kiss me.
I will try.” He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his salutation remained.
He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he managed to strengthen her.
It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once.” Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves.
They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf.
They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity.
Trembling, anxious, cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go round the world.
The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had your father’s room.
I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.” He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.” “Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window.
It was evening and again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully.
“What can such people be made of?” “Same stuff as parsons are made of.” “Nonsense!” “Quite right.
It is nonsense.” “Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.” “Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and advancing his face to hers.
“What’s there to cry at?
Kiss me here.” He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all.
When it came to the point, it was she who remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who knew whose room this had been last year.
It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.” “Now kiss me here; then here.” Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window, opened it (as the English will), and leant out.
There was the parapet, there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills.
The cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago.
A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool.
He had helped himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its name is, still shows.” “San Miniato.
I’ll just finish your sock.” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils, the Miss Bartletts!
Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?” “Not yet.” His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?” “Silly boy!
He thinks he’s being dignified.
He knew we should go off in the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands.
They had fair warning, and now he calls it an elopement.
Ridiculous boy—” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” “But it will all come right in the end.
He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women.
He has, for the second time, quite altered.
Why will men have theories about women?
I haven’t any about men.
I wish, too, that Mr. Beebe—” “You may well wish that.” “He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us again.
I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner.
I wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run.” “Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only thing I did do—and you came back to me.
So possibly you know.” He turned back into the room.
“Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to the window, so that she, too, saw all the view.
They sank upon their knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one another’s names.
Ah!
it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—” “Oh, bother that man!” But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte.
How cruel she would be to a man like that!” “Look at the lights going over the bridge.” “But this room reminds me of Charlotte.
How horrible to grow old in Charlotte’s way!
To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house.
For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
You couldn’t have made me.
When I am very happy”—she kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs.
If Charlotte had only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to silly Greece, and become different for ever.” “But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely.
He said so.” “Oh, no, she didn’t see him.
She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church.
She said so.” George was obstinate again.
“My father,” said he, “saw her, and I prefer his word.
He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett.
A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up.
He didn’t speak to her.” Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other’s arms.
It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting.
George, who disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew.
Then, why did she risk the meeting?
She knew he was there, and yet she went to church.” They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind.
She rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?” “Mean what?” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.” “Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.” “Niente.” The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?” He whispered: “Is it this?
Is this possible?
I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped.
That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down.
That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped.
I can’t explain her any other way.
Can you?
Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable.
The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend.
There are details—it burnt.
I read the book afterwards.
She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through.
She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
We can never make friends with her or thank her.
But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.” “It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.” Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited, love attained.
But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean.
[Illustration] A Room With A View By E. M. Forster CONTENTS PART ONE Chapter I The Bertolini “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at all.
She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart.
Oh, Lucy!” “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the Signora’s unexpected accent.
“It might be London.” She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A.
Oxon.
), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London?
I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside.
I suppose it is one’s being so tired.” “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno.
The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.
The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!” “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that you shouldn’t have a view.” Lucy felt that she had been selfish.
“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of course, you must look over the Arno, too.
I meant that.
The first vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no.
You must have it.” “I insist on it.
Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.” “She would never forgive _me_.” The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a little peevish.
They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument.
He said: “I have a view, I have a view.” Miss Bartlett was startled.
Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.
She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she glanced at him.
He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes.
There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes.
These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim.
So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A view?
Oh, a view!
How delightful a view is!” “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George.
He has a view too.” “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have yours.
We’ll change.” The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.
Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.” “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.” “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy.
Her cousin again repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted.
“Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son.
“There’s nothing else to say.” He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful.
Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before.
Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change?
What possible objection had she?
They would clear out in half an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality.
It was impossible to snub any one so gross.
Her face reddened with displeasure.
She looked around as much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are genteel.” “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear.
This pension is a failure.
To-morrow we will make a change.” Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness.
Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh!
Why, it’s Mr. Beebe!
Oh, how perfectly lovely!
Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are.
Oh!” Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint: “How do you do, Mr. Beebe?
I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.” The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.
But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
“Just fancy how small the world is.
Summer Street, too, makes it so specially funny.” “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—” “Yes, I heard from mother so last week.
She didn’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr.
Beebe is—’” “Quite right,” said the clergyman.
“I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June.
I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.” “Oh, how glad I am!
The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.” “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.” “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.” He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons.
He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before.
It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field.
“Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded.
“The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.” “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table.
“Mr.
Beebe, you are wrong.
The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.” “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin.
“We are in luck.” And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them.
People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would grow upon them.
The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do.
Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them.
And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato!
They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words.
I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.” The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did.
It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more than cloth.
Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her daughter.
It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.
Was this really Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.
She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle.
“We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.
“The first evening means so much.
When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.” He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?” “Emerson.” “Is he a friend of yours?” “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.” “Then I will say no more.” He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing.
His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.” “You acted very naturally,” said he.
He seemed thoughtful, and after a few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of accepting.” “No _harm_, of course.
But we could not be under an obligation.” “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show gratitude.
He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he means.
He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them.
He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite.
It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.” Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice.” “I think he is; nice and tiresome.
I differ from him on almost every point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores.
When he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up.
He has no tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will not keep his opinions to himself.
We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.” “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?” Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?” “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet.
He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains.
Of course, he has all his father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.” “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett.
“So you think I ought to have accepted their offer?
You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?” “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.” “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?” He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared.
“Why didn’t you talk, Lucy?
He prefers young people, I’m sure.
I do hope I haven’t monopolized him.
I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time.” “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a clergyman.” “My dear Lucia—” “Well, you know what I mean.
And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.” “Funny girl!
How you do remind me of your mother.
I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe.” “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.” “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world.
I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.” “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine.
She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered.
Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.” And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more careful.
It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.” Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat.
Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room.
It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England.
Signora Bertolini is so English.” “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy.
“We dread going to bed.” “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed.
“If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful!
We were so sorry for you at dinner.” “I think he was meaning to be kind.” “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr.
Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature.
Of course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.” “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
No one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know.
No, he is not tactful; yet, have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?” “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.
“Are not beauty and delicacy the same?” “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly.
“But things are so difficult, I sometimes think.” She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms.
I’m so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again.
He has let me come and ask you.
He would be so pleased.” “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious.
I must apologize for my interference.” Gravely displeased, he turned to go.
Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours.
It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only here through your kindness.
If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it.
Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?” She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this.
I do not wish the acceptance to come from you.
Grant me that, at all events.” Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously: “Mr.
Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.” The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally.
But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out.” Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath.
All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first.
Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms!
It is all he can do to keep polite.” “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe.
Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.
“Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part.
Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature.
Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow.
Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said: “I think one might venture now.
No, Lucy, do not stir.
I will superintend the move.” “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear.
It is my affair.” “But I would like to help you.” “No, dear.” Charlotte’s energy!
And her unselfishness!
She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
So Lucy felt, or strove to feel.
And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful.
At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room.
Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.” Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him.
I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.” “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.
It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances.
It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation.
Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle.
Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson.
So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him.
Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.
It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
An electric tram came rushing underneath the window.
No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand.
Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go.
Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.
Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.
The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway.
Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.
So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone.
By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.
Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out?
Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone.
Miss Bartlett could not allow this.
Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin.
Oh, no!
that would never do.
Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person.
Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe.
Italians understand.
A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.
Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.” Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad.
The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.” Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut!
Miss Lucy!
I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He does but touch the surface of things.
As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it.
The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.” This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.
Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno.
How delightfully warm!
But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?
Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante.
San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story.
The men on the river were fishing.
(Untrue; but then, so is most information.)
Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried: “A smell!
a true Florentine smell!
Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.” “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
Buon giorno!
Buon giorno!” bowing right and left.
“Look at that adorable wine-cart!
How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!” So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.
It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno!
Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors.
_That_ is the true democracy.
Though I am a real Radical as well.
There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy.
“We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.” “I see, I see.
And now you have gone over to the enemy.” “Oh, please—!
If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right.
And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.” “Shameful!
A manufacturing district, I suppose?” “No—in the Surrey hills.
About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.” Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well.
It is full of the very nicest people.
Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?” “Very well indeed.” “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?” “Why, she rents a field of us!
How funny!” Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?” “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob.
“Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.” Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
Italy receded.
They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her.
And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed: “Bless us!
Bless us and save us!
We’ve lost the way.” Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window.
But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost!
lost!
My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.
How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do?
Two lone females in an unknown town.
Now, this is what _I_ call an adventure.” Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven!
And no, you are not, not, _not_ to look at your Baedeker.
Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it.
We will simply drift.” Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became discontented herself.
For one ravishing moment Italy appeared.
She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale.
There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven.
Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop, because it looked so typical.
It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown.
But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness.
Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically.
It was Santa Croce.
The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them.
I do detest conventional intercourse.
Nasty!
they are going into the church, too.
Oh, the Britisher abroad!” “We sat opposite them at dinner last night.
They have given us their rooms.
They were so very kind.” “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish.
“They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.
It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.” “What would you ask us?” Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she, at all events, would get full marks.
In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried: “There goes my local-colour box!
I must have a word with him!” And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes.
Then she began to get tired.
The beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places.
She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original.
But at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both gesticulating largely.
Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her Baedeker.
How could she find her way home?
How could she find her way about in Santa Croce?
Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in Florence again.
A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans.
Of course, it must be a wonderful building.
But how like a barn!
And how very cold!
Of course, it contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper.
But who was to tell her which they were?
She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
There was no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she began to be happy.
She puzzled out the Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.
She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed.
Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated.
What could this mean?
They did it again and again.
Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue.
Punishment followed quickly.
The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward.
She was too late.
He fell heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted forward also.
“Hard in life, hard in death.
Go out into the sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
Intolerable bishop!” The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and frightened!
But what else can you expect from a church?” The child’s legs had become as melting wax.
Each time that old Mr. Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar.
Fortunately an Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue.
By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
He stood.
Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson.
“You have done more than all the relics in the world.
I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy.
There is no scheme of the universe—” He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons.
She was determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply.
“But what are you doing here?
Are you doing the church?
Are you through with the church?” “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance.
“I came here with Miss Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.” “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.” “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
“I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded.
It’s worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker.
_That’s_ worth minding.” Lucy was puzzled.
She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where the idea would lead?
She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you.
I really came to help with the child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.” “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say.
You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious.
But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it.
Lucy could not get cross.
Mr. Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him.
On the other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him.
It was at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope.
It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will kindly tell me which they are.” The son nodded.
With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel.
There was a hint of the teacher about him.
She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared.
Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective.
Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true?
How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!” “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort!
Built by faith indeed!
That simply means the workmen weren’t paid properly.
And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
Look at that fat man in blue!
He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.” He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might.
The audience shifted uneasily, and so did Lucy.
She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her.
They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it?
Yes or no?” George replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all.
I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.” “You will never go up,” said his father.
“You and I, dear boy, will lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives.” “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is, going up.
It did happen like that, if it happened at all.” “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice.
“The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.” The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands.
They filed out of the chapel in silence.
Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“There’s plenty of room for us all.
Stop!” The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.” George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is.
I don’t remember.” “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
It’s that Mr.
Eager.
Why did he go?
Did we talk too loud?
How vexatious.
I shall go and say we are sorry.
Hadn’t I better?
Then perhaps he will come back.” “He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
Cuthbert Eager.
Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent.
The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her.
“He will try to be kind.” “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters.
But he is kind to people because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.” “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully—” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain.
Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness.
She saw him once again at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns.
Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only find solution in the night.
The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people.
They won’t come back.” “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy.
“Have you looked at those saints?” “Yes,” said Lucy.
“They are lovely.
Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin?” He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.
There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists.
But Mr. Emerson was only half interested.
He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily.
“I saw nothing in it.” “I like Giotto,” she replied.
“It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values.
Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
A baby is worth a dozen saints.
And my baby’s worth the whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.” Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated.
“He’s unhappy.” “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?
What more is one to give him?
And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God.
With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.” She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one.
She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked.
“He comes out for his holiday to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone.
Eh?
What did you say?” Lucy had made no suggestion.
Suddenly he said: “Now don’t be stupid over this.
I don’t require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me.
He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose?
But let yourself go.
You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night.
Let yourself go.
Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself.
It will be good for both of you.” To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.” “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.” “What things?” “The things of the universe.
It is quite true.
They don’t.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?” In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: “‘From far, from eve and morning, The stuff of life to knit me George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?
We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
But why should this make us unhappy?
Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice.
I don’t believe in this world sorrow.” Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us.
Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.” Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.
A young man melancholy because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried.
“You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then she became matronly.
“Oh, but your son wants employment.
Has he no particular hobby?
Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother.
Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.” The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it.
Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.
Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.
The dear George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd.
He approached, his face in the shadow.
He said: “Miss Bartlett.” “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective.
“Where?
Where?” “In the nave.” “I see.
Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson.
“Poor girl!” She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
“Poor girl?
I fail to understand the point of that remark.
I think myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you.
I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid time.
Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it.
Good-bye.
Thank you both so much for all your kindness.
Ah, yes!
there does come my cousin.
A delightful morning!
Santa Croce is a wonderful church.” She joined her cousin.
Chapter III Music, Violets, and the Letter “S” It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano.
She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected.
The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom.
Lucy had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.
Nor was she the passionate young lady, who performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the pictorial style.
And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory.
Victory of what and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano.
A few people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep.
She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarette-case.
Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it.
It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower.
The seats were filled with a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork.
Among the promised items was “Miss Honeychurch.
Piano.
Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III.
He was in suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends.
With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory.
He was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen.
The audience clapped, no less respectful.
It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners.
I do not consider her choice of a piece happy.
Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs.” “Introduce me.” “She will be delighted.
She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon.” “My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe.
“Why ever did she listen to it?” When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch, disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face.
She loved going to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and meringues.
He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also.
But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him: “If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting both for us and for her.” Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing!
Some one said just the same to mother, and she said she trusted I should never live a duet.” “Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?” “She doesn’t mind it.
But she doesn’t like one to get excited over anything; she thinks I am silly about it.
She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any one’s.
She has never got over it.
Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant—” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality.
She could not complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet.
The whole life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey, and the hills were dirty purple.
Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold, tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and a tickling cough in her throat.
On another day, when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray.
She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe.” “Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy.
This was a stock remark, the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition.
Miss Lavish was so original.
Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness.
For that, and for other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is writing a book?” “They do say so.” “What is it about?” “It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know.” “I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.
We started such friends.
But I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce.
Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.” “The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.” He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish.
They were always in each other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third.
Miss Lavish he believed he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning.
Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells?
All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work.
Girls like Lucy were charming to look at, but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped.
The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore.
But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse.
She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill!
And Mr. Beebe here besides.
Who would suppose this is Italy?
There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.” She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in my room with the door shut.
Doors shut; indeed, most necessary.
No one has the least idea of privacy in this country.
And one person catches it from another.” Lucy answered suitably.
Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.
The Italians are a most unpleasant people.
They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves.
We are at their mercy.
They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires.
From the cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial!
They have no conception of the intellectual life.
How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer over the children’s edjucaishion.
_Hi_ won’t ’ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’” Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way.
Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers.
Indeed, who would have supposed that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last the cause was disclosed.
From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “E.
L.” “That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman.
“A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she’d start a pipe.” “Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.
She took to it, practically in despair, after her life’s work was carried away in a landslip.
Surely that makes it more excusable.” “What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say they nearly always do.
Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink.
She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written.
The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she had an idea.
First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came here—this must on no account get round.
And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.” Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring.
She felt she had made almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.” Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade.
That old Mr. Emerson, who puts things very strangely—” Her jaw dropped.
She was silent.
Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper: “Stomach.
He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind.
I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden.
As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter.
But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought.
She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce.
Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson.
Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ Just imagine!
‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak.
I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking.
I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman!
I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place.
But that was not all.
After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.” “Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I shall go alone.’ She went.
At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.” “Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows.
No one will ever know.
Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.” “Mr.
Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice?
I do so want to know.” Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.
“No; but it is so difficult.
Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him.
Miss Alan, what do you think?
Is he nice?” The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.
Mr. Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying: “I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.” “Violets?
Oh, dear!
Who told you about the violets?
How do things get round?
A pension is a bad place for gossips.
No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce.
Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch!
It really was too bad.
No, I have quite changed.
I do _not_ like the Emersons.
They are _not_ nice.” Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly.
He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed.
He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them.
Miss Lavish, who represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans, who stood for good breeding, were following her.
Miss Bartlett, smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil.
The case of Lucy was different.
She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail.
After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now.
Even their seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once.
Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite politely, of course.” “Most right of her.
They don’t understand our ways.
They must find their level.” Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under.
They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son.
He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them.
It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle.
There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief.
“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said Lucy.
“I want to go round the town in the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say: “I wish we could.
Unluckily I have letters.
If you do want to go out alone, won’t you be better on your feet?” “Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!” But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her from the window, “and she knows it.
I put it down to too much Beethoven.” Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr. Beebe was right.
Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music.
She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan.
Conversation was tedious; she wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram.
This she might not attempt.
It was unladylike.
Why?
Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why.
It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different.
Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much.
But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.
The dragons have gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst.
She reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early Victorian song.
It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas!
the creature grows degenerate.
In her heart also there are springing up strange desires.
She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.
Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are alive.
Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
Nor has she any system of revolt.
Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she had done so.
This afternoon she was peculiarly restive.
She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved.
As she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus, being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it.
(A pity in art of course signified the nude.)
Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it.
She felt a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s “Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni Madonnas.
For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.
She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her to be conscious of it.
“The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to her.
The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it.
Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind.
It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.
An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him, and rest content.
Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.
It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky.
Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.
“Cinque lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest.
He frowned; he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all.
A crowd rose out of the dusk.
It hid this extraordinary man from her, and bore him away to the fountain.
Mr. George Emerson happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where the man had been.
How very odd!
Across something.
Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?” “Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything.
She had complained of dullness, and lo!
one man was stabbed, and another held her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade.
He must have carried her.
He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees.
She repeated: “Oh, what have I done?” “You fainted.” “I—I am very sorry.” “How are you now?” “Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home.
There’s no point in our stopping.” He held out his hand to pull her up.
She pretended not to see it.
The cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily.
The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been!
I might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well.
I can go alone, thank you.” His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?” “I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.
I must have dropped them out there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously.
“Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?” He added to his kindness.
As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!” She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.” “Yes, I am, thank you so very much.” “No, you aren’t.
You’d go openly if you were.” “But I had rather—” “Then I don’t fetch your photographs.” “I had rather be alone.” He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him.
“And don’t move till I come back.” In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in dreams.
The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day, and joined itself to earth.
How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square?
Again the thought occurred to her, “Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man, had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder.
Oddly enough, it was an easy topic.
She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before.
Being strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood.
She rose without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her, she walked firmly enough towards the Arno.
There a cabman signalled to them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police!
Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish.
When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?” He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?” “Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr.
Emerson!” “Well?” “Where are the photographs?” He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.” “I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.
Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood.
There!
I’m glad I’ve told you; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them.” He pointed down-stream.
“They’ve gone.” The river swirled under the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man.
“For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled.
It isn’t exactly that a man has died.” Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.” “Mr.
Emerson—” He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.” They were close to their pension.
She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment.
He did likewise.
There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship.
She moved her elbows before saying: “I have behaved ridiculously.” He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what came over me.” “I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.” “Oh, all right.” “And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?” “I’m afraid I don’t.” “I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?” “Your behaviour?
Oh, yes, all right—all right.” “Thank you so much.
And would you—” She could not carry her request any further.
The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
He had thrown her photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason.
It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man.
He would do her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might even have a high opinion of her.
But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe.
It was useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.
She had been in his arms, and he remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari’s shop.
It was not exactly that a man had died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents do happen, and then one returns to the old life!” “I don’t.” Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.” “But why, Mr. Emerson?
What do you mean?” “I shall want to live, I say.” Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno, whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson.
She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also.
They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.
It might have been most unpleasant.
Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone.
None of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the embankment.
Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure, not that she had encountered it.
This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action.
There were two plans between which she had to choose.
Mr. Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies.
Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?
Charlotte declined for herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.
But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth.
“It’s very kind of Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you.
I had much rather.” “Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.
How abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always!
But now she should alter.
All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the Lung’ Arno.
The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and colour.
Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it.
She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this, too!” Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did.
“Look, Lucia!
Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party.
I feared you would repent you of your choice.” Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.
Yesterday had been a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo.
Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not to re-enter it.
She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately remained.
Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria.
She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance.
For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.
She hailed them briskly.
The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett.
“After your despair of yesterday!
What a fortunate thing!” “Aha!
Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck.
Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?” “I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.” The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless creatures.
I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn’t pry.” She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few calculations in realism.
Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material.
A good deal of it was unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt.
The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note.
For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.” That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?” Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot.
But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish concluded.
“It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline.
There will be a deal of local colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall also introduce some humorous characters.
And let me give you all fair warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.” “Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett.
“I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons.” Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can.
For I repeat and I insist, and I have always held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life.” There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded.
Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett.
“That last remark struck me as so particularly true.
It should be a most pathetic novel.” Lucy assented.
At present her great aim was not to get put into it.
Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,” continued Miss Bartlett slowly.
“None but the superficial would be shocked at her.
We had a long talk yesterday.
She believes in justice and truth and human interest.
She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr.
Eager!
Why, how nice!
What a pleasant surprise!” “Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.” “We were chatting to Miss Lavish.” His brow contracted.
“So I saw.
Were you indeed?
Andate via!
sono occupato!” The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile.
“I am about to venture a suggestion.
Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a drive in the hills?
We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour’s ramble on the hillside.
The view thence of Florence is most beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape.
Decidedly.
But who looks at it to-day?
Ah, the world is too much for us.” Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that Mr.
Eager was no commonplace chaplain.
He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home.
He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent.
Tea at a Renaissance villa?
Nothing had been said about it yet.
But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same.
But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew.
A drive in the hills with Mr.
Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no longer the greatest of them.
She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain.
“In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity.
Andate via!
andate presto, presto!
Ah, the town!
Beautiful as it is, it is the town.” They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies.
To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and humiliating.” “Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened.
She can hardly bear to speak of it.” She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question.
“Do not blame her, please, Mr.
Eager.
The fault is mine: I left her unchaperoned.” “So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable.
His dark, handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.” “One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience.
I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?” Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—” “Were over at the Loggia.” “That must have saved you much.
You have not, of course, seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.” Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal league of Italy with youth.
He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr.
Eager, binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico’s angels.
She tore.
A shrill cry rose from the vendor.
The book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr.
Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a grievance.
His mysterious persecution of Mr.
Eager became relentless; the air rang with his threats and lamentations.
He appealed to Lucy; would not she intercede?
He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on bread.
He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued.
Under the chaplain’s guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy.
She had been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr.
Eager, she knew not why.
And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased to respect them.
She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist.
She doubted that Mr.
Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose.
They were tried by some new test, and they were found wanting.
As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte she was exactly the same.
It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact.
A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press.
I came across him at Brixton.” They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr.
Eager, “one has only sympathy for their success.
The desire for education and for social advance—in these things there is something not wholly vile.
There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as they would make of it.” “Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.” He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.” “Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead.
I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with me.
He was in my London parish long ago.
The other day in Santa Croce, when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him.
Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub.” “What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr.
Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended.
Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity.
Lucy, though she wished never to see the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man?
We know that already.” “Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all.
The boy—an innocent child at the time—I will exclude.
God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him.” “Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not hear.” “To speak plainly,” said Mr.
Eager, “it is.
I will say no more.” For the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the first time in her life.
“You have said very little.” “It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.
He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips.
It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily.
“That man murdered his wife!” “How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.
That day in Santa Croce—did they say anything against me?” “Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.” “Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you.
But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
“They’re nothing to me.” “How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene.
The shopman was possibly listening.
“She will find it difficult.
For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God.” The addition of God was striking.
But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
A silence followed which might have been impressive, but was merely awkward.
Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive.
“Drive?
Oh, is our drive to come off?” Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr.
Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed.
“It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all.
Why should he invite us in that absurd manner?
We might as well invite him.
We are each paying for ourselves.” Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish.” “How?” “Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.” “That will mean another carriage.” “Far worse.
Mr.
Eager does not like Eleanor.
She knows it herself.
The truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.” They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank.
Lucy stood by the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer, or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain.
The well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets?
Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it.
Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck.
She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank.
As she groped she murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr.
Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we must be prepared.
It is you they really want; I am only asked for appearances.
You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will follow behind.
A one-horse carriage would do for us.
Yet how difficult it is!” “It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.” “Oh, dear, Lucy!
I do hope Florence isn’t boring you.
Speak the word, and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.” “Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her mother’s letters could be.
She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway.
She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs.
Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news that interested her least.
“Do you know the Vyses?” “Oh, not that way back.
We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria.” “They’re nice people, the Vyses.
So clever—my idea of what’s really clever.
Don’t you long to be in Rome?” “I die for it!” The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant.
It has no grass, no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick.
By an odd chance—unless we believe in a presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity.
Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before.
Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly.
“Here’s an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel?
For I do know what I want.
I’m sick of Florence.
No, you said you’d go to the ends of the earth!
Do!
Do!” Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied: “Oh, you droll person!
Pray, what would become of your drive in the hills?” They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up the stony hill.
Mr. Beebe recognized him at once.
Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.
And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light.
To her Mr.
Eager objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition.
But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
She did not mind.
Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy.
The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss Lavish.
For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting Mr.
Eager, had doubled the size of the party.
And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus transformed.
Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.
But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr.
Eager, repressive towards Miss Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring.
She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate.
But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully.
In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy.
She had refused, not because she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he did know.
And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia, but by the river.
To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled emotion, but of the whole fabric.
There was really something blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word.
This sense of wickedness had been slight at first.
She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo.
But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again.
And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr.
Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling?
As a student of art?” “Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!” “Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like myself?” “Oh, no.
I am here as a tourist.” “Oh, indeed,” said Mr.
Eager.
“Are you indeed?
If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.
The result is, they mix up towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl.
You know the American girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’ There’s travelling for you.
Ha!
ha!
ha!” “I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit.
“The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.” “Quite so.
Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are here for trade, for example.
But the greater part are students.
Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico.
I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left.
No, you can only see it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall.
She is very proud of that thick hedge.
Inside, perfect seclusion.
One might have gone back six hundred years.
Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?” “It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish.
“Tell me, where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day?” But Mr.
Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr.
Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill.
“Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’?
He is working at Gemistus Pletho.
Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.” During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully.
Lucy had a spasm of envy.
Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.
They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road.
“Piano!
piano!” said Mr.
Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped his horses up again.
Now Mr.
Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or was he one of its manifestations?
The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.
“Piano!
piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.
Phaethon, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was most unpleasant.
The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr.
Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but at its manner.
At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and patted them on the back to signify his approval.
And Miss Lavish, though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried.
“But I dare say I shall receive scant support.
I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life.
This is what _I_ call an adventure.” “We must not submit,” said Mr.
Eager.
“I knew he was trying it on.
He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.” “Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood in no awe.
“Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there?
To be driven by lovers—A king might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I know.” Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect.
Mr.
Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will, was determined to make himself heard.
He addressed the driver again.
Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream, with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker, and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased.
Why should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto.
She pointed at the other carriage.
Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other.
Then Persephone got down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr.
Eager, smiting his hands together as the carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson.
“It is defeat.
You have parted two people who were happy.” Mr.
Eager shut his eyes.
He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but he would not speak to him.
The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took up the matter warmly.
He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money.
He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.
We have no rights over his soul.” Miss Lavish frowned.
It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said.
“He jolted us.” “That I deny.
It was as restful as sleeping.
Aha!
he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder?
He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is justified.
And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl, too.
It doesn’t do to injure young people.
Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici?” Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have.
Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature?” “The Lord knows.
Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go fighting against the Spring.’” Mr.
Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured.
“‘War not with the May’ would render a correct meaning.” “The point is, we have warred with it.
Look.” He pointed to the Val d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them.
Do you suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man?
But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.” No one encouraged him to talk.
Presently Mr.
Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain.
It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before.
He had ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending.
Standing there, he had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work.
But where exactly had he stood?
That was the question which Mr.
Eager hoped to solve now.
And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups.
Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask.
In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio Baldovinetti, but the drive.
Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was very sorry that she had asked him.
She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him.
Mr. Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish.
“Oh, but I shall die!
Of course it was the railway!” She could not control her mirth.
“He is the image of a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.” “Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion.
“Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—” “I can’t stop.
Let me go my wicked way.
A porter—” “Eleanor!” “I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy.
“The Emersons won’t hear, and they wouldn’t mind if they did.” Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly.
“Pouf!
Wouf!
You naughty girl!
Go away!” “Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr.
Eager, I’m sure.” “I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.” “Mr.
Eager will be offended.
It is your party.” “Please, I’d rather stop here with you.” “No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish.
“It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.
Miss Lucy, you are to go.
We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.” The girl was stubborn.
As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.
Such a one was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte.
She wished she had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Oh, I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here.” Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm.
Lucy did not look at the view either.
She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish.
“Observe my foresight.” With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy.
The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
If I do feel it coming on I shall stand.
Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist.
“Here we are, all settled delightfully.
Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown.
Sit down, dear; you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared her throat.
“Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold.
It’s the tiniest cough, and I have had it three days.
It’s nothing to do with sitting here at all.” There was only one way of treating the situation.
At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr.
Eager, vanquished by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.
The miscreant, a bony young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up.
Of course he knew where.
Not so far either.
His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon.
He should just think he did know where.
He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary.
What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good?
Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings!
He showed her his cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?” She was correct as usual.
He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her.
Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.
Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
She thanked him with real pleasure.
In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
For the first time she felt the influence of Spring.
His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?” “Ma buoni uomini.” He bowed.
Certainly.
Good men first, violets afterwards.
They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker.
They were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces.
He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant boughs.
She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.
Not a step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?” There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.
The voice of Mr.
Eager?
He shrugged his shoulders.
An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge.
She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen.
The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
Light and beauty enveloped her.
She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.” She did not answer.
From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view, and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam.
But never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival.
For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.
He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves.
The bushes above them closed.
He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called, “Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.
What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was slow to discover.
Mr.
Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk.
Mr. Emerson, seeking his son, was told whereabouts to find him.
Mr. Beebe, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the return home.
There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment.
Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics.
Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise.
Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett.
Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager.
Mr. Emerson had lost George.
Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square.
Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable.
He climbed on to the box shivering, with his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather.
“Let us go immediately,” he told them.
“The signorino will walk.” “All the way?
He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently.
I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.
He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence.
He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.
He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also.
Not so these English.
They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents, but infinitely the least dangerous.
Once back in the town, he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more.
Of course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it.
But after all, what have we to do with taverns?
Real menace belongs to the drawing-room.
It was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun.
Lucy sat beside her; Mr.
Eager sat opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious.
They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together.
The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol.
There was a lightning flash, and Miss Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front.
At the next flash, Lucy screamed also.
Mr.
Eager addressed her professionally: “Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith.
If I might say so, there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements.
Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?” “No—of course—” “Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous.
The steel knives, the only articles which might attract the current, are in the other carriage.
And, in any case, we are infinitely safer than if we were walking.
Courage—courage and faith.” Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand.
At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles, gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr.
Eager!” called Mr. Beebe.
“We want your assistance.
Will you interpret for us?” “George!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way.
He may be killed.” “Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver is no help.
Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.” “He may be killed!” cried the old man.
“He may be killed!” “Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage.
“In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.” “What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr.
Eager know?” “Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing.
But—” she pointed at the driver—“_he_ knows everything.
Dearest, had we better?
Shall I?” She took out her purse.
“It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book, she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it.
As well this ending to his day as any.
But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road.
The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen.
If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt.
They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.
They descended from the carriages; they embraced each other.
It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them.
For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly.
In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike.
Miss Lavish calculated that, even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the accident.
Mr.
Eager mumbled a temperate prayer.
But the drivers, through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me.
Kiss me again.
Only you can understand me.
You warned me to be careful.
And I—I thought I was developing.” “Do not cry, dearest.
Take your time.” “I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse.
Once by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?” The thought disturbed her repentance.
As a matter of fact, the storm was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not.
One would always pray against that.” “He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that.
I simply slipped into those violets.
No, I want to be really truthful.
I am a little to blame.
I had silly thoughts.
The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.” “In a book?” “Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.” “And then?” “But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
Indeed, she had little more to learn.
With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her.
All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
“It is so hard to be absolutely truthful.” “Don’t be troubled, dearest.
Wait till you are calmer.
We will talk it over before bed-time in my room.” So they re-entered the city with hands clasped.
It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others.
The storm had ceased, and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son.
Mr. Beebe had regained good humour, and Mr.
Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish.
Charlotte alone she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening.
She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it.
All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be carefully laid before her cousin.
And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself.
I shan’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know what.” Miss Alan asked her to play.
She refused vehemently.
Music seemed to her the employment of a child.
She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own.
Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay.
In vain she tried to check, or at all events to accelerate, the tale.
It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach: “Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire.
Come into my room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.” With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the girl.
Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?” She was unprepared for the question.
It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything.
A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done?
A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.” The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door.
A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes.
She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?” “The driver?” “My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.” Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?” “I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.” “I, too, intend to judge him charitably.
But unfortunately I have met the type before.
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first?
Come here and listen to me.
I am only gathering it from his own remarks.
Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another?” “Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude.
There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish.
But we are no farther on with our question.
What do you propose to do?” An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it.
But—as you said—it is my affair.
Mine and his.” “And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?” “Certainly not.
There would be no difficulty.
Whatever you ask him he answers, yes or no; then it is over.
I have been frightened of him.
But now I am not one little bit.” “But we fear him for you, dear.
You are so young and inexperienced, you have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round.
This afternoon, for example, if I had not arrived, what would have happened?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?” “I hadn’t time to think.
You came.” “Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?” “I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off.
She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett.
“You will be seen from the road.” Lucy obeyed.
She was in her cousin’s power.
She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started.
Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man!
We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless.
There is Mr.
Eager, but you do not trust him.
Oh, for your brother!
He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.
Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead.
There are still left some men who can reverence woman.” As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and ranged them upon the pin cushion.
Then she blew into her gloves and said: “It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.” “What train?” “The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?” “At eight.” “Signora Bertolini would be upset.” “We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.” “I expect she will.
However, we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses’ hotel.
Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?” “Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained motionless and silent.
To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome.
Lucy, when admonished, began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte, who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly.
She knelt down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.
But she was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her, but needed her to love.
For it was in ominous tones that she said, after a long pause: “Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?” Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant.
Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: “Charlotte dear, what do you mean?
As if I have anything to forgive!” “You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
I know well how much I vex you at every turn.” “But no—” Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged martyr.
“Ah, but yes!
I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped.
I might have known it would not do.
You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you.
I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.” “Please—” “My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and were often able to leave me at home.
I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary.
You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.” “You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other, heart and soul.
They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own.
“Failed to make you happy; failed in my duty to your mother.
She has been so generous to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.” “But mother will understand.
It is not your fault, this trouble, and it isn’t a disaster either.” “It is my fault, it is a disaster.
She will never forgive me, and rightly.
For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish?” “Every right.” “When I was here for your sake?
If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you.
Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.” Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence.
There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.” The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her.
But in case she should blame you in any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to.
I will never speak of it either to her or to any one.” Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.
Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background.
George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually.
At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since, it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent.
She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed, for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love.
Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters.
Before she reached them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle.
Thus it was that, though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers.
She was still dressed.
It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved.
At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said: “I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.” Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr. Emerson.” His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true.
It can’t all be true.
I want not to be muddled.
I want to grow older quickly.” Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear.
You need all the rest you can get.” In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun.
They were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied.
A poet—none was present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room.
One—a boy of nineteen—was studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano.
From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him what she had written.
And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother.
“I tell you I’m getting fairly sick.” “For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
“Time they did.” “I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.” “It’s his third go, isn’t it?” “Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.” “I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy.
I don’t know how girls manage things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.” “Do you indeed, dear?
How interesting!” “I feel—never mind.” He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse.
I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’” “Yes, mother, you told me.
A jolly good letter.” “I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.
But—’” She stopped reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all.
He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth.
When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.” “Nor me.” “You?” Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?” “He asked me for my permission also.” She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir.
“Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?
What ever did you say?” “I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’” “What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come.
There they still are!” “I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.” “Peeping like that!
Can’t I look out of my own window?” But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves.
For a brief space they were silent.
Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave a nervous gulp.
“Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy.
He practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her?
And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.” “I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.” “I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth.
“There!
Fly into a stew!
I can’t help it—had to say it.
I had to say no.
He ought never to have asked me.” “Ridiculous child!” cried his mother.
“You think you’re so holy and truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit.
Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say?
I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?” “Oh, do keep quiet, mother!
I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.
I tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right.
But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.” “No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the subject, “I shall not keep quiet.
You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.” “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
“I only let out I didn’t like him.
I don’t hate him, but I don’t like him.
What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.” He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“I know his mother; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick the piano!
He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained dissatisfied.
She added: “And he has beautiful manners.” “I liked him till just now.
I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.” “Mr.
Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest.
“I don’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in.” “You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means.
He said: ‘Mr.
Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he meant.
He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking.
Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.” “You never can, dear.
But I can.
You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.” The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it.
But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust.
Cecil praised one too much for being athletic.
Was that it?
Cecil made one talk in one’s own way.
This tired one.
Was that it?
And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow’s cap.
Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself.
He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother.
“‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light.
She keeps that flat abominably—” “Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?” “Don’t interrupt so foolishly.
Where was I?
Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing.
I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything.
But I do not know—’” “Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation.
He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles.
Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds.
But it was transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald.
Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described.
He was medieval.
Like a Gothic statue.
Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism.
A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant.
And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!” “I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals.
They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.
We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the furniture.
“This is indeed a joyous day!
I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy.” “I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat.
She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis.
Then she saw her brother’s face.
Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?” Cecil suggested.
“And I’d stop here and tell my mother.” “We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.” They passed into the sunlight.
Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and descend out of sight by the steps.
They would descend—he knew their ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed, until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical.
He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s.
That day she had seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel.
But Italy worked some marvel in her.
It gave her light, and—which he held more precious—it gave her shadow.
Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence.
She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness.
Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other.
It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the same to him as before.
Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language.
She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her.
He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
The things that really mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy.
His mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he moved to the writing table.
There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many erasures.
He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.
With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table.
The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter.
He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about it none the less.
It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected.
“I represent all that he despises.
Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?” The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
“Mr.
Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse.
Do you suppose that I shall get it?” “I should say so.
Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.” “Pfui!” “I know,” said Cecil.
“I know.
I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.” For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip.
Isn’t this news?” “News?
I don’t understand you,” said Cecil.
“News?” Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field.
He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!” “Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself.
Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen!
Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
But his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question!
To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church!
I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.” “I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly.
“I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board.
Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the right names.
I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery.
It is very remiss of me.
Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.” Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?” “I have no profession,” said Cecil.
“It is another example of my decadence.
My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
I know I ought to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.” “You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe.
“It is a wonderful opportunity, the possession of leisure.” His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally.
He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve.
I daren’t face the healthy person—for example, Freddy Honeychurch.” “Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?” “Admirable.
The sort who has made England what she is.” Cecil wondered at himself.
Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly contrary?
He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea before evening service.” “I suppose Anne never told them you were here.
In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives.
The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?” “I know the faults of Mary.
She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.” “The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small.” They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many.
No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.” “She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree.
At present she has none.” “At present?” “I’m not cynical.
I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle.
Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.” Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?” “Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps.
Oh, I forgot; of course, you knew her before.
No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.” “In what way?” Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string.
Picture number two: the string breaks.” The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically.
At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?” “No.
I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.” “It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst.
He cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken?
What do you mean?” “I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.” The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize.
I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners.
Was this the reception his action would get from the world?
Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly.
“I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.” “Not that.
But you ought to have stopped me.
I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes.
Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with any one; certainly not with you.” “You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?” Mr. Beebe pulled himself together.
Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions.
He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet.
I foresaw at Florence that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended.
I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio.
He did not omit to do so.
“She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her.” “Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?” Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march.
Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried.
He looked at Lucy.
In her presence he could not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.
I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great and small.
I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and mother.
And now I want my tea.” “You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted.
“How dare you be serious at Windy Corner?” He took his tone from her.
There was no more heavy beneficence, no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures.
None of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe.
Away from it, in the solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical.
But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious.
It has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart.
The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed.
Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel sentimental.
Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.
If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true.
Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them greatly.
They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door.
Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance.
Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as a mother-in-law.
As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him.
People congratulated Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid.
They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with the dowagers.
When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?” “I suppose so.
Mother, would it be?” “Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and said: “To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.” “I am so sorry that you were stranded.” “Not that, but the congratulations.
It is so disgusting, the way an engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment.
All those old women smirking!” “One has to go through it, I suppose.
They won’t notice us so much next time.” “But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong.
An engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and should be treated as such.” Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially correct.
The spirit of the generations had smiled through them, rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth.
To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite different—personal love.
Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said.
“Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?” “I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public.
The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic.
Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato.” “Inglese Italianato?” “E un diavolo incarnato!
You know the proverb?” She did not.
Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother.
But Cecil, since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.” “We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?” “It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in, or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?” She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert.
“I don’t see any difference.
Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same place.” “We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap.
“This is me.
That’s Windy Corner.
The rest of the pattern is the other people.
Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.” She leant placidly back.
Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and that’s Mr. Beebe.” “A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.” Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect what they meant.
She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried.
“I consider him far above the average.
I only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful ones, is Mr.
Eager, the English chaplain at Florence.
He was truly insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate.
He was a snob, and so conceited, and he did say such unkind things.” “What sort of things?” “There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife.” “Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing.
Mr.
Eager would never come to the point.
He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.” “Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander?
It was, I believe, chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped.
People pretended he was vulgar, but he certainly wasn’t that.” “Poor old man!
What was his name?” “Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr.
Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know.
I hate him.
I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto.
I hate him.
Nothing can hide a petty nature.
I _hate_ him.” “My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“You’ll blow my head off!
Whatever is there to shout over?
I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen.” He smiled.
There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s moral outburst over Mr.
Eager.
It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine.
He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not in muscular rant.
But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive.
After a moment, he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval.
He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.
He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.
The outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact.
Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I feel I could never live out of it.
When I’m in the country I feel the same about the country.
After all, I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who live amongst them must be the best.
It’s true that in nine cases out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything.
The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions.
Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town.
Do you feel that, Mrs. Honeychurch?” Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled.
She had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either.
Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics.
It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?” “‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?” “Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled spire.
Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church.
In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages.
Some great mansions were at hand, but they were hidden in the trees.
The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement, having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals.
“Albert” was inhabited.
His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace.
“Cissie” was to let.
Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically.
“Summer Street will never be the same again.” As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry.
Now we shall know.
Sir Harry, pull those things down at once!” Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I meant to.
I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss Flack.” “Am I not always right?
She ought to have gone before the contract was signed.
Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s time?” “But what can I do?” He lowered his voice.
“An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden.” “Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully.
He had had full warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory.
He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt.
Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper.
He ventured to differ, however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration.
Sir Harry hinted that a column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin.
He built his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage.
He had failed in his duties to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy landlord.
But it is such an awkward size.
It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.” Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them.
The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously.
“It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.” “Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly.
“That is exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong type of people.
The train service has improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind.
And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?” “Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate.
She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea.
How would you like spinsters?” “My dear Lucy, it would be splendid.
Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.
I heard from them last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.
I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people.
Mr. Beebe knows them, too.
May I tell them to write to you?” “Indeed you may!” he cried.
“Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
How delightful it is!
Extra facilities—please tell them they shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees.
Oh, the agents!
The appalling people they have sent me!
One woman, when I wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance.
As if one cares about that!
And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable.
And oh, the deceit!
I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week.
The deceit of the most promising people.
My dear Lucy, the deceit!” She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all.
I know the type.
Preserve me from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy.
It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down.” “I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very sad thing.” “The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil.
“I haven’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.” “Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.” “It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied.
“I oughtn’t to come with my troubles to young people.
But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no real help.” “Then may I write to my Misses Alan?” “Please!” But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed: “Beware!
They are certain to have canaries.
Sir Harry, beware of canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come.
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.” “Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
If they get drunk, there’s an end of them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off.
If they’re vulgar, they somehow keep it to themselves.
It doesn’t spread so.
Give me a man—of course, provided he’s clean.” Sir Harry blushed.
Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex.
Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction.
He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself.
She was delighted.
Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house.
Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?” “Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.
He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha!
young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!” “I can’t help it.
It would be wrong not to loathe that man.” “He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.” “No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life.
In London he would keep his place.
He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife would give brainless dinner parties.
But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and every one—even your mother—is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt discouraged.
“I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.” “It matters supremely.
Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!
How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
with his bald head and retreating chin!
But let’s forget him.” This Lucy was glad enough to do.
If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape?
For instance, Freddy.
Freddy was neither clever, nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”?
And what would she reply?
Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety enough.
She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps, during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them.
Summer Street lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
“Why is it, Lucy, that you always say the road?
Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?” “Haven’t I?
The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with me in a room.” “A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes.
Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road.
Never in the real country like this.” “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
I have never felt anything of the sort.
You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.” “I don’t know that you aren’t.
I connect you with a view—a certain type of view.
Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?” She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing: “Do you know that you’re right?
I do.
I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room.
How funny!” To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray?
With no view?” “Yes, with no view, I fancy.
Why not?” “I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open air.” She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?” As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees.
She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!” “Why do you call it that?” “I can’t remember why.
I suppose it comes out of some book.
It’s only a puddle now, but you see that stream going through it?
Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful.
Then Freddy used to bathe there.
He is very fond of it.” “And you?” He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed here, too, till I was found out.
Then there was a row.” At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of prudishness within him.
But now?
with his momentary cult of the fresh air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity.
He looked at her as she stood by the pool’s edge.
She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?” “Charlotte,” she murmured.
“She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.” “Poor girl!” She smiled gravely.
A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
“What, Cecil?” “Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me—” He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed.
His courage had gone.
“Yes?” “Up to now I have never kissed you.” She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?” “Of course, you may, Cecil.
You might before.
I can’t run at you, you know.” At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities.
Her reply was inadequate.
She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil.
As he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them.
Such was the embrace.
He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure.
Passion should believe itself irresistible.
It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young man behind the counter would have done?
He recast the scene.
Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness.
For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation.
He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts.
At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.” “What name?” “The old man’s.” “What old man?” “That old man I told you about.
The one Mr.
Eager was so unkind to.” He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had.
Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to.
Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself.
Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs.
Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy.
He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility.
“I cannot think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter.
When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.
The best obtainable.
Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles.
A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia.
Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes.
In this circle, one thought, married, and died.
Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills.
But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high.
You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you.
She returned with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation.
He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad.
He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
Nor did he realize a more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her.
A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved.
For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.” “But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe.
“I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably.
They are coming.
I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried.
“Just because they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing.
And poor Lucy—serve her right—worn to a shadow.” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court.
Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn.
When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring.
“If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count.
I told you not Saturn.” “Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.” “Saturn doesn’t bounce.” “Saturn bounces enough.” “No, he doesn’t.” “Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.” “Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in.
That’s right, Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over the shins!” Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness.
Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt.
He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
But he hated the physical violence of the young.
How right it was!
Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.” “That wasn’t the name—” Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.” “Nonsense, Freddy!
You know nothing about it.” “Nonsense yourself!
I’ve this minute seen him.
He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem!
ahem!
I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’ and slapped him on the back.” “Exactly.
The Miss Alans?” “Rather not.
More like Anderson.” “Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed.
“Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right?
I _said_ don’t interfere with Cissie Villa.
I’m always right.
I’m quite uneasy at being always right so often.” “It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s.
Freddy doesn’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.” “Yes, I do.
I’ve got it.
Emerson.” “What name?” “Emerson.
I’ll bet you anything you like.” “What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly.
“I wish I had never bothered over it at all.” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky.
Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy?
Do you know what Emersons they are?” “I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was democratic.
Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person.
All right, Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother’s a snob.
But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s affectation to pretend there isn’t.” “Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways.
Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man.
Pray, does that satisfy you?” “Oh, yes,” he grumbled.
“And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety.” “_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly.
“Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.” “But has Cecil—” “Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’” She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much.
While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl.
She might well “screech” when she heard that it came partly from her lover.
Mr. Vyse was a tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people.
The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
He diverted it as follows: “The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean?
No, I don’t suppose it will prove to be them.
It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse’s.
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people!
The queerest people!
For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets.
They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa.
Poor little ladies!
So shocked and so pleased.
It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories.
‘My dear sister loves flowers,’ it began.
They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult.
Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets.” “Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister’s face was very red.
She could not recover herself.
Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature—pessimism, et cetera.
Our special joy was the father—such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.
He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Lucy, don’t desert us—go on playing bumble-puppy.
Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place.
That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being there.
Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop?
By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time.” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer.
He suggested that his hostess was mistaken.
At the hint of opposition she warmed.
She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told.
The name escaped her.
What was the name?
Oh, what was the name?
She clasped her knees for the name.
Something in Thackeray.
She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely.
“Don’t be silly.
You always overdo it when you play.” As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
Hitherto truth had come to her naturally.
She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely truthful?
Well, at all events, she must not tell lies.
She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame.
A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.
“Cecil!” “Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window.
He seemed in high spirits.
“I was hoping you’d come.
I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse.
George Meredith’s right—the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa.
Don’t be angry!
Don’t be angry!
You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.” He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said.
“Freddy has told us.
Naughty Cecil!
I suppose I must forgive you.
Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have nice friends of yours.
But you oughtn’t to tease one so.” “Friends of mine?” he laughed.
“But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was.
“Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week.” “What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously.
“I don’t quite understand.” “In the Umbrian Room.
Absolute strangers.
They were admiring Luca Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly.
However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not a little.
They had been to Italy.” “But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends.
I thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—” “Cecil!
No, it’s not fair.
I’ve probably met them before—” He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair.
Anything is fair that punishes a snob.
That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good.
Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with me.
There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things.
I believe in democracy—” “No, you don’t,” she snapped.
“You don’t know what the word means.” He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque.
“No, you don’t!” Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil.
I blame you—I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous.
You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense?
I consider it most disloyal of you.” She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness.
As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded.
He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally.
He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent.
In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse.
His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch.
Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement, met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned.
The Miss Alans were duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held responsible for the failure.
Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived.
Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood.
And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood.
Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood.
But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done.
She was glad that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative.
He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy.
At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do!
I don’t know what I should do without you.” Several days passed.
Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett.
A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not corresponded since they parted in August.
The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased amazingly.
For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical.
Charlotte, unselfish in the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue their tour.
Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs.
Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly.
Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS, “_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA, “I have news of you at last!
Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome.
Puncturing her tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out.
He said his father had just taken the house.
He _said_ he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (?).
He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea.
Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him to enter the house, etc.
That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you have told them already.
Mr. Vyse is so sensitive.
I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome.
I am very sorry about it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me, “Your anxious and loving cousin, “CHARLOTTE.” Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows: “BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE, “Many thanks for your warning.
When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she would blame you for not being always with me.
I have kept that promise, and cannot possibly tell her now.
I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself.
She should have tried at the Rectory.
I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage.
You must see that it would be too absurd.
If the Emersons heard I had complained of them, they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they are not.
I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy Corner at all, but here.
Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your envelope again.
No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately, “L.
M. HONEYCHURCH.” Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not.
Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at?
Miss Bartlett suggested the former.
Perhaps she was right.
It had become a great thing now.
Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago.
She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school.
But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.
It did her no harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors.
The weather was cool, and it did her no harm.
In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people.
The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.
One was tired of everything, it seemed.
One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter.
In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann.
“Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the querulous beauty of the music had died.
She shook her head and played Schumann again.
The melody rose, unprofitably magical.
It broke; it was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave.
The sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of the audience throb.
Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s, had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among many people.
The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.” “Her music always was wonderful.” “Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean.
She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.” “Italy has done it.” “Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her.
“It is just possible.
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.” “But her music!” he exclaimed.
“The style of her!
How she kept to Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schumann was right for this evening.
Schumann was the thing.
Do you know, mother, I shall have our children educated just like Lucy.
Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then—not till then—let them come to London.
I don’t believe in these London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.” “Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s room.
Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself.
She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.” “Bad dreams?” “Just dreams.” The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You should have heard us talking about you, dear.
He admires you more than ever.
Dream of that.” Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed.
Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed.
As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.” “M’m.” “They might amuse you.” Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe.
“They are worth it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
“Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!” “I’ve brought someone to see you.” “I’ll be down in a minute.” The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered.
“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment.
What have they got?
Byron.
Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad.
Never heard of it.
The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it.
Gibbon.
Hullo!
dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.” “Mr.
Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.” “I know.
Isn’t it jolly?
I like that.
I’m certain that’s the old man’s doing.” “How very odd of him!” “Surely you agree?” But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.” “The same as Lucy’s got.” “Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?” “She came back yesterday.” “I suppose she had a good time?” “Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book.
“She and Cecil are thicker than ever.” “That’s good hearing.” “I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.” Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks.
She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books.
Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
Cecil says—” “What on earth are those people doing upstairs?
Emerson—we think we’ll come another time.” George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.” Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face wanted washing.
At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe.” “Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do?
how d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard.
But I’m afraid it will only act between men.
Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How do you do?
Come and have a bathe’?
And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.” “I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.
I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.” “We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you place in the past, is really yet to come.
We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.” Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead.
We despise the body less than women do.
But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.” “I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once.
But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
It is our heritage.” “Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.” “How do you do?
Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty.
I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He has been most kind.
He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
Ah, this wind!
You do well to bathe.
Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!” “Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy.
“I must—that is to say, I have to—have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.” “_Call_, my lad?
Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
Call on your grandmother!
Listen to the wind among the pines!
Yours is a glorious country.” Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr.
Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval.
It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, George.
Why do you dawdle talking?
Bring them back to tea.
Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his office.
I can’t believe he’s well.” George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him.
“It is only a pond, don’t you know.
I dare say you are used to something better.” “Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.” Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
How glorious it was!
For a little time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
He spoke of Florence.
George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse!
Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?” “I did not.
Miss Lavish told me.” “When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of Coincidence.’” No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.” To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is.
I have reflected.
It is Fate.
Everything is Fate.
We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart.
The twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—” “You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman.
“Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
Don’t say, ‘I didn’t do this,’ for you did it, ten to one.
Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?” “Italy.” “And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?” “National Gallery.” “Looking at Italian art.
There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.” “It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George.
“But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.” Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is still to write.” Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that you have come.” Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond.
I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe.
“No apologies are necessary for the pond.” George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid?
I love willow-herb in seed.
What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
Very charming, very charming.” “Mr.
Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George.
Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
It was necessary to use his muscles.
It was necessary to keep clean.
Mr. Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful, water’s simply ripping.” “Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful.
Mr. Beebe, do.” “Apooshoo, kouf.” Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
How glorious it was!
The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Götterdämmerung.
But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
They began to play.
Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
A little deferentially, they splashed George.
He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: “No.
We are what matters.
Without us shall no enterprise begin.
To us shall all flesh turn in the end.” “A try!
A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a kick.
“Goal!” “Goal!” “Pass!” “Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat!
No, that’s enough, Freddy.
Dress now.
No, I say!” But the two young men were delirious.
Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
“Hi!
Steady on!
I see people coming you fellows!” Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi!
hi!
_Ladies!_” Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
Still, they did not hear Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Whoever were those unfortunate people?
Oh, dears, look away!
And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?” “Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
Cecil, Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—” No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently “minded.” “I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.” “This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.” They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
“I can’t be trodden on, can I?” “Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you!
What miserable management!
Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?” “Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and if another fellow—” “Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
Come, Lucy.” They turned.
“Oh, look—don’t look!
Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
How unfortunate again—” For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken.
“I’ve swallowed a pollywog.
It wriggleth in my tummy.
I shall die—Emerson you beast, you’ve got on my bags.” “Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
“And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.” “Mother, do come away,” said Lucy.
“Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.” “Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed.
Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called: “Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
Hullo!” “Bow, Lucy; better bow.
Whoever is it?
I shall bow.” Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away.
On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for youth.
Chapter XIII How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview!
But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume.
Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent.
She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life.
A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much.
“I will bow,” she had thought.
“I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom?
To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.
It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.
Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and he did not want to be seen.
He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside.
He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done.
Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock.
Miss Bartlett, indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory.
Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with Cecil?” The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.” “Perhaps he’s tired.” Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.” “I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.” “Cecil has told you to think so.
You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.” “Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?” “Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?” “Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble ahead.
“It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him sometimes seem—” “Oh, rubbish!
If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother!
I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!” “Not in that way.
At times I could wring her neck.
But not in that way.
No.
It is the same with Cecil all over.” “By-the-by—I never told you.
I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London.” This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me.
No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.” “I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to.
But he does not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.” “Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?” “You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.” “Then why didn’t he leave the room?
Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone’s pleasure?” “We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy.
Something had enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form.
The two civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes.
Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he had succeeded.
And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother—” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
Go.” She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window.
It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.
Now, as in the winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes.
One connected the landing window with depression.
No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly.
And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.
She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.” “My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been!
You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public.
It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else.
Do be more careful.
You forget the place is growing half suburban.” “I say, is anything on to-morrow week?” “Not that I know of.” “Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.” “Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.” “What’s wrong with the court?
They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered new balls.” “I meant _it’s_ better not.
I really mean it.” He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper.
Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans.
Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making!
I have something to say to you.
Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes.
I really can’t stop.
I must dress too.” “How’s Charlotte?” “All right.” “Lucy!” The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?” “Her _what?_” “Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?” “I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly.
“I shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.” Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out.
She did not.
She said: “Come here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life.
It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil.
Cecil despised their methods—perhaps rightly.
At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven.
Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
Then Freddy said: “Lucy, what’s Emerson like?” “I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?” “Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.” “He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly.
I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.” “Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter.” “One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie.
“Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.” “Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.” “She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily.
The remark was a happy one, for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print.
Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath.
But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness.
There were too many ghosts about.
The original ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr.
Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes.
It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s.
How is she?” “I tore the thing up.” “Didn’t she say how she was?
How does she sound?
Cheerful?” “Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.” “Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler.
I know myself how water preys upon one’s mind.
I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the meat.” Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish.
I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long.” It was more than her nerves could stand.
And she could not protest violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded.
“It’s impossible.
We can’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is.
Freddy’s got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare.
It simply can’t be done.” “Nonsense!
It can.” “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
Not otherwise.” “Minnie can sleep with you.” “I won’t have her.” “Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.” “Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy.
“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.” “No, I don’t.
And no more does Cecil.
She gets on our nerves.
You haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good.
So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come.” “Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two.
You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers.
You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.” Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike,” put in Freddy.
“She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.” “I know, dear.
She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return.” But Lucy hardened her heart.
It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She had tried herself too often and too recently.
One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth.
She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother.
I don’t like Charlotte.
I admit it’s horrid of me.” “From your own account, you told her as much.” “Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
She flurried—” The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the places she had known as a child.
The Sacred Lake would never be the same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner.
How would she fight against ghosts?
For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care for eggs.
I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.” Cecil frowned again.
Oh, these Honeychurches!
Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact.
“May me and Lucy get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.” Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room—something with no view, anything.
Her love to Lucy.
And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
She never gazed inwards.
If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
She was nervous at night.
When she talked to George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
Once she had suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious.
Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
She loved Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
Standing between Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his crudities in time.
I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.” Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits.
He laughs more.” “Yes,” replied the clergyman.
“He is waking up.” That was all.
But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs. Honeychurch drove to meet her.
She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“I have upset everything.
Bursting in on young people!
But I insist on paying for my cab up.
Grant that, at any rate.” “Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.” “I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather.
Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.” Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
Only sovereigns and pennies.
Could any one give her change?
Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But who am I to give the sovereign to?” “Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.” Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid.
A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
I should practically be robbing the one who lost.” “Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil.
“So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.” “Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
“How is that, Mr. Vyse?” “Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab.
Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.” Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy.
He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
“I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid.” “Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.” “But I don’t see—” They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you.
I’m done.
I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me.
Ow!
What about Mr. Floyd’s ten shillings?
Ow!
No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.” “I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
“Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
A shilling was it?
Can any one give me change for half a crown?” “I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign.
No, give me up that sovereign.
I’ll get Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning.” “Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?” “No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
“Let me see—a sovereign’s worth of silver.” She escaped into the kitchen.
Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were too uncanny.
It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t.
Here is your money—all shillings, except two half-crowns.
Would you count it?
You can settle your debt nicely now.” Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source.” “Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle.
“George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?” Miss Bartlett considered.
“For instance, the driver.
I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.” Lucy shuddered a little.
“We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren’t careful.
How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?” “We must think of every possibility.” “Oh, it’s all right.” “Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows.
In fact, he is certain to know.” “I don’t care if he does.
I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.” “To contradict it?” “No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best.
Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
Ladies are certainly different.” “Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully.
“You kind, anxious thing.
What _would_ you have me do?
First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say, ‘Tell’.
Which is it to be?
Quick!” Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest.
I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
You will never forgive me.” “Shall we go out, then.
They will smash all the china if we don’t.” For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again.
Have you seen the young one yet?” “Yes, I have.” “What happened?” “We met at the Rectory.” “What line is he taking up?” “No line.
He talked about Italy, like any other person.
It is really all right.
What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way.
He really won’t be any nuisance, Charlotte.” “Once a cad, always a cad.
That is my poor opinion.” Lucy paused.
“Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
It was a new one from Smith’s library.
Her mother must have returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
I don’t think we ought to blame him very much.
It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
He has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into tears.
He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big railways—not a porter!
and runs down to his father for week-ends.
Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
There!
Now for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm.
“Suppose we don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.” Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
Explanations took place, and in the midst of them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain.
Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most of the days of that year.
In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold.
Up on the heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.
Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path.
From the house came incoherent sounds, as of females preparing for worship.
“The men say they won’t go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her, no nonsense”—“Anne!
Mary!
Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine.
Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously.
The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender shadow.
But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window.
Her new cerise dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan.
At her throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an engagement ring.
Her eyes are bent to the Weald.
She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.
In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills.
“Lucy!
Lucy!
What’s that book?
Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?” “It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.” “But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.” Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a Loggia.
She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up.
It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil had said, “What!
you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?” She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.
I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child?
Minnie!
That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!)
Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late.
Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse, never the carriage.
“Where’s Charlotte?
Run up and hurry her.
Why is she so long?
She had nothing to do.
She never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses!
Minnie!” Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting.
As usual, she didn’t see why.
Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men?
The young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words.
Mrs. Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but sovereigns and half crowns.
Could any one give me—” “Yes, easily.
Jump in.
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock!
You put us all to shame.” “If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully.
She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse.
The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
“Good-bye!
Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering.
On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation.
He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.
All that he said on this subject pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church.
There was a line of carriages down the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa.
To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother.
“Unless the young man considers that he knows me already.” He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally.
Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how glad he was that she was going to be married.
She said yes, she was glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice; she had never known him offended before.
He added: “We find, though, that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing.
I am very much upset about it.” “I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,” said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further.
“He thought we should be artistic.
He is disappointed.” “And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up.
What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly.
She must avoid censuring Cecil.
For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned, though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says.
He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall.
Yet it does seem so unkind.” “There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“That’s exactly what I say.
Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?” “There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,” he continued in measured tones.
“We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.
Choose a place where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!” “Eh—?” “I see you’re going to be clever.
I hope you didn’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy.” George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
“He behaved that way to me.
It is his philosophy.
Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first.” “What _do_ you mean?
No, never mind what you mean.
Don’t explain.
He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
Do you play tennis?
Do you mind tennis on Sunday—?” “George mind tennis on Sunday!
George, after his education, distinguish between Sunday—” “Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.
No more do I. That’s settled.
Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased.” He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans.” “I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck.
The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the morning sun?
She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.” “Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady.
Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow.
It was the pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow.
Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered.
He said: “I—I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house.
Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them.
“George has been in such good spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.” Lucy caught her cousin’s eye.
Something in its mute appeal made her reckless.
“Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven.
Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy.
All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things.
It was not an exploit.
He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her hand to her cheek.
“He does not love me.
No.
How terrible if he did!
But he has not told.
He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right.
It’s a secret between us two for ever.
Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room.
The secret, big or little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world.
Thus she interpreted her joy.
She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so safe.
As he helped her out of the carriage, she said: “The Emersons have been so nice.
George Emerson has improved enormously.” “How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them, and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth.
For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected.
He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are.
George Emerson is coming up this afternoon.
He is a most interesting man to talk to.
Only don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks.
Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal.
Generally Lucy was depressed at meals.
Some one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will not last, this cheerfulness.
In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee.
Her mother would always sit there, her brother here.
The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would never be hidden behind the western hills.
After luncheon they asked her to play.
She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.
Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.” She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round.
There George was.
He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
Cecil should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson.
Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.
She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano.
“I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.” “Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil.
“I will not spoil the set.” He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil.
I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s Emerson.” George corrected him: “I am not bad.” One looked down one’s nose at this.
“Then certainly I won’t play,” said Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse.
You had much better not play.
Much better not.” Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would play.
“I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall back on Lucy.
There is no other way out of it.
Lucy, go and change your frock.” Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature.
She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon.
As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner.
She liked music, but how much better tennis seemed.
How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms.
Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child.
George served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
The hills stood out above its radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara.
She might be forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her.
He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others.
He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke.
When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.” “What fun, Cecil!
Read away.
Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!” “Do you mind being beaten?” She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a splendid player, though.
The light was behind you, and it was in my eyes.” “I never said I was.” “Why, you did!” “You didn’t attend.” “You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house.
We all exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.” “‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset.
Leonora was speeding—’” Lucy interrupted.
“Leonora?
Is Leonora the heroine?
Who’s the book by?” “Joseph Emery Prank.
‘Sunset.
Leonora speeding across the square.
Pray the saints she might not arrive too late.
Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it now—’” Lucy burst into laughter.
“‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed!
Why it’s Miss Lavish!
It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under somebody else’s name.” “Who may Miss Lavish be?” “Oh, a dreadful person—Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?” Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up.
“Of course I do.
I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street.
It was she who told me that you lived here.” “Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean something else.
She watched his head, which was almost resting against her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening.
“No wonder the novel’s bad,” she added.
“I never liked Miss Lavish.
But I suppose one ought to read it as one’s met her.” “All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature.
“Every one writes for money in these days.” “Oh, Cecil—!” “It is so.
I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow.
The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her.
She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?” “I never notice much difference in views.” “What do you mean?” “Because they’re all alike.
Because all that matters in them is distance and air.” “H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.” “I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up.
Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.” He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured.
“I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again.
I’m so sorry he’s not so well.” “No, he isn’t well.” “There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil.
“Also that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.” “Mr.
Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?” “None.
Why?” “You spoke of ‘us.’” “My mother, I was meaning.” Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!” “I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” “I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.
It is the first thing that I remember.” Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after tennis—he didn’t do.
He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.” “Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.” “No—read away.
I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud.
If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.” This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him.
It put their visitor in the position of a prig.
Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr.
Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book.
Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked.
But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning.
“Find me chapter two, if it isn’t bothering you.” Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.” She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.” He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone.
Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village.
The season was spring.’” Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose, for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read.
He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence, while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets.
All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’” Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use.
No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’” “This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last.
She thought a disaster was averted.
But when they entered the shrubbery it came.
The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring.
That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove.
Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I must write some letters,” and went up to her room.
Then she prepared for action.
Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty.
Perhaps there never is such a contest.
It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first aim was to defeat herself.
As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been.
Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him.
The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.
In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
“Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?” Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.
“There is a scene in it.
The hero and heroine make love.
Do you know about that?” “Dear—?” “Do you know about it, please?” she repeated.
“They are on a hillside, and Florence is in the distance.” “My good Lucia, I am all at sea.
I know nothing about it whatever.” “There are violets.
I cannot believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her?
I have thought before speaking; it _must_ be you.” “Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.” Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved.
“Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t put that in her book?” Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it.
Yes.” “Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” “So you did tell?” “I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of conversation—” “But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell mother?” “I will never forgive Eleanor.
She has betrayed my confidence.” “Why did you tell her, though?
This is a most serious thing.” Why does any one tell anything?
The question is eternal, and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response.
She had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again.
Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes?
Behind Cecil’s back as we were walking up the garden.” Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now?
Can you tell me?” “Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day.
Fancy if your prospects—” “I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word.
“I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.” It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince.
“However,” said the girl, despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done.
You have put me in a most awkward position.
How am I to get out of it?” Miss Bartlett could not think.
The days of her energy were over.
She was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that.
She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him?
I can’t tell mother now—owing to you.
Nor Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you.
I am caught up every way.
I think I shall go mad.
I have no one to help me.
That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.” Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing.
What’s to be _done?_ We women go maundering on.
What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?” “I always said he was a cad, dear.
Give me credit for that, at all events.
From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a bath.” “Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong!
We’ve both made a muddle of it.
George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he to be left unpunished, or isn’t he?
I want to know.” Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless.
Her own exposure had unnerved her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain.
She moved feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?” “Willingly would I move heaven and earth—” “I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously.
“Will you speak to him?
It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word.” “Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.” “It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture.
“No one will help me.
I will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below.
“Found the lost ball?
Good man!
Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you!
I admire you—” They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul.
Her anger faded at the sight of him.
Ah!
The Emersons were fine people in their way.
She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying: “Freddy has taken him into the dining-room.
The others are going down the garden.
Come.
Let us get this over quickly.
Come.
I want you in the room, of course.” “Lucy, do you mind doing it?” “How can you ask such a ridiculous question?” “Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand.
“I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded.
She remembered their last evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss Bartlett’s toque on the door.
She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time.
Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying.
“The jam’s jolly good.” George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room.
As she entered he stopped, and said: “No—nothing to eat.” “You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants.
Where’s mother?” “She’s started on her Sunday writing.
She’s in the drawing-room.” “That’s all right.
You go away.” He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table.
Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech.
She just said: “I can’t have it, Mr. Emerson.
I cannot even talk to you.
Go out of this house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door.
“I hate a row.
Go please.” “What—” “No discussion.” “But I can’t—” She shook her head.
“Go, please.
I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.” “You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t mean that you are going to marry that man?” The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her.
“You are merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse.
He’s only for an acquaintance.
He is for society and cultivated talk.
He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.” It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss—” “No, but have you ever?
He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.
It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.
I would never have let myself go.
But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters.
Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.
That is the man all over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find.
Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to settle whether you were shocked or no.
Cecil all over again.
He daren’t let a woman decide.
He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.
Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon.
Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’ because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control.
I’m not ashamed.
I don’t apologize.
But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you.
Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly?
But therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.” Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson.
Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.” And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality.
He said: “Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary.
“I’m the same kind of brute at bottom.
This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He thought.
“Yes—really in a better way.
I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards her.
“Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain.
I have cared for you since that man died.
I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun.
As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered.
I called.
I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.” “And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm.
“Does he not matter?
That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly?
A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?” He said: “It is our last chance.
I shall do all that I can.” And as if he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening.
“You wouldn’t stop us this second time if you understood,” he said.
“I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.” Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though demolishing some invisible obstacle.
She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
“It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really.
It is that love and youth matter intellectually.” In silence the two women watched him.
His last remark, they knew, was nonsense, but was he going after it or not?
Would not he, the cad, the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish?
No.
He was apparently content.
He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house.
Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!” Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet.
“Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the latter.
One more fuss through with you, Charlotte.
Many thanks.
I think, though, that this is the last.
My admirer will hardly trouble me again.” And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish: “Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it?
Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really.
It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.” “Let’s go down to them.” But, once in the open air, she paused.
Some emotion—pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring.
That something or other mattered intellectually?
A leaf, violently agitated, danced past her, while other leaves lay motionless.
That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy!
There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll hurry.” “Mr.
Emerson has had to go.” “What a nuisance!
That spoils the four.
I say, Cecil, do play, do, there’s a good chap.
It’s Floyd’s last day.
Do play tennis with us, just this once.” Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete.
As you well remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you.” The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes.
How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement.
Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered.
He had nothing to say.
He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things over.
We are too different.
I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.” It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—” “I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
“My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.” “I don’t understand you.
You aren’t like yourself.
You’re tired, Lucy.” “Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once.
“That is exactly like you.
You always think women don’t mean what they say.” “Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.” “What if I do?
It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth.
I can’t marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.” “You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches.
But give me a moment’s time.” He closed his eyes.
“You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.” It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
To bring on the crisis, she said: “There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.” “I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never could play.
I don’t understand a word you say.” “You can play well enough to make up a four.
I thought it abominably selfish of you.” “No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis.
Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
You talked of our wedding at lunch—at least, you let me talk.” “I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly.
“I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
Of course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.” She developed this position.
“Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted to be my husband?
I don’t think so.
You don’t like Freddy, nor my mother.
There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point.
They have to-day.
I see clearly.
I must speak.
That’s all.” “I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently.
“I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
It’s all too horrible.” “What’s the good of a scene?” “No good.
But surely I have a right to hear a little more.” He put down his glass and opened the window.
From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy or any one might be outside.” He obeyed.
“I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved me!” “I did not,” she said.
“I thought I did at first.
I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.” He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
She had counted on his being petty.
It would have made things easier for her.
By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently.
I dare say you are right not to.
But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.” “Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort who can’t know any one intimately.” A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that.
But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
It is that, more or less.
When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always protecting me.” Her voice swelled.
“I won’t be protected.
I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
To shield me is an insult.
Can’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
A woman’s place!
You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
That’s why I break off my engagement.
You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause.
Then Cecil said with great emotion: “It is true.” “True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word.
It is a revelation.
It is—I.” “Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.” He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true.
I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
You are even greater than I thought.” She withdrew a step.
“I’m not going to worry you.
You are far too good to me.
I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
I have never known you till this evening.
I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—” “What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance.
She cried: “If you think I am in love with some one else, you are very much mistaken.” “Of course I don’t think that.
You are not that kind, Lucy.” “Oh, yes, you do think it.
It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting, brutal!
As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.” He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past.
I shall never say it again.
You have taught me better.” She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity.
I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.” “All right, Cecil, that will do.
Don’t apologize to me.
It was my mistake.” “It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke.
“I must actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really am.
Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
Will you shake hands?” “Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
“Good-night, Cecil.
Good-bye.
That’s all right.
I’m sorry about it.
Thank you very much for your gentleness.” “Let me light your candle, shall I?” They went into the hall.
“Thank you.
Good-night again.
God bless you, Lucy!” “Good-bye, Cecil.” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry.
In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself.
She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within.
They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
As the years pass, they are censured.
Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one.
The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill.
On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy Corner,—he laughed.
The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.
The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road.
So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly.
Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.
One might laugh at the house, but one never shuddered.
Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip.
He had heard from the Miss Alans.
These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed their plans.
They were going to Greece instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter.
Of course, Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train.
But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.” Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her.
She would see the fun of it, and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty.
Though she was hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she could not play the piano as she did.
He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been understood.
This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been illustrated by facts.
Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.
Therefore it must be the horse, who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy.
They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs.
Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station.
They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it.
“Isn’t it wonderful?
Isn’t it romance?
Most certainly they will go to Constantinople.
They are taken in a snare that cannot fail.
They will end by going round the world.” Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious!
I never notice it in you young people; you do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing.
‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn!
No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans.
They want the Pension Keats.” “I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you any matches?” “I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?” “Never.” “Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit.
I haven’t been to Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my friends going.
It is altogether too big for our little lot.
Don’t you think so?
Italy is just about as much as we can manage.
Italy is heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus.
All right, Freddy—I am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
“I was saying, if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience.
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me.
There the contrast is just as much as I can realize.
But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the victoria.” “You’re quite right,” said Cecil.
“Greece is not for our little lot”; and he got in.
Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really.
And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box, which had not been returned.
As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
Cecil’s hard hit.
Lucy won’t marry him.
If you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down.” “But when—” “Late last night.
I must go.” “Perhaps they won’t want me down there.” “No—go on.
Good-bye.” “Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart.
The house was again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata.
He hesitated a moment, but went down the garden as requested.
There he found a mournful company.
It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of assistance.
At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe?
Gracious what a mess everything is!
Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.” Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her.
“You have worried them as much as they can stand.
Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly.
I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.” “Oh, must you?
Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it.” Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about for, either in the house or out of it.” Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.
As they walked up the garden, the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother.
Or will she come with us?” “I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.” “They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has gone, and Freddy won’t play with me.
In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.” “Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur.
“Go and put on your boots.” He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart.
She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do?
Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive.
Would you come too?” “I don’t think I will, thank you.” “No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.” Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!” “Yes.” “I met them on the hill.
Your brother told me.” “Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed.
Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.” “Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have done the right thing.” “So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.” “I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.” “So does mother.
Mother minds dreadfully.” “I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.
It was really a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.” “Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he?
I gathered that he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.” “Boys are so odd.” Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor.
Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel.
Mr. Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action, so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan.
That was really what brought me over.
I thought it might amuse you all.” “How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.
After a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with “Going abroad?
When do they start?” “Next week, I gather.” “Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
Always complaisant, he put the letter away.
But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!
How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad!” “I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast!” She laughed heartily.
“Oh, delightful!
I wish they’d take me.” “Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel?
Perhaps George Emerson is right.
He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’” “Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople.
I have always longed to go to Constantinople.
Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?” Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm.
She had always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed.
He saw, to his surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends, after Cissie Villa.” “Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would give anything to go with them.” “Would your mother spare you again so soon?
You have scarcely been home three months.” “She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement.
“I simply _must_ go away.
I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
“Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away?
I didn’t realize at the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.” “You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—” “Yes, yes.
I knew you’d understand.” Mr. Beebe did not quite understand.
Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family?
Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her.
Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying.
He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down.” “I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all.
Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so masterful.
I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
He would improve me in places where I can’t be improved.
Cecil won’t let a woman decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t.
What nonsense I do talk!
But that is the kind of thing.” “It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you.
I do sympathize and agree most profoundly.
I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?” “But I must go somewhere!” she cried.
“I have been worrying all the morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with clenched fists, and repeated: “I must!
And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
You all think much too highly of me.
I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased.
“I must get away, ever so far.
I must know my own mind and where I want to go.” “Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out of the front-door.
He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource.
She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be.
I know all about it.
The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak.” Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett.
As he had put it to himself at Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
He assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter drop.” “I wonder.” “It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street.
It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at the present moment.” Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows.
Death is a strong word—surely too strong.
There was no question of tragedy.
He said: “Of course, Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she chooses.
Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.” “I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly.
“Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you.
One cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy.
A chance word to a chattering friend, and—” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
A rector lives in a web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he will regard them.
He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately?
I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish.
It is odd how we of that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another’s lives.
Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.
We must really give the Signora a testimonial.” And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern.
On the summit they paused.
The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue.
Summer was retreating.
The wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven.
The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery.
Mr. Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.” They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.
That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably.
Mr. Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces.
They would hand the child her food through the window.
Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past.
I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit.
She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her.
But the future.
Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again.
“I don’t know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.” Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.” To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you.
In it I spy Lucy’s salvation.” “Really.
Now, why?” “She wanted to leave Windy Corner.” “I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to say—selfish.” “It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire a change.” Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect misses.
Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced.
Perhaps she must have a change.
I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand these things.
But why need she go as far as Greece?” “You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner.
“Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?)
Why not Tunbridge Wells?
Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning.
I cannot help her.
I will say no more.
Perhaps I have already said too much.
I am not to talk.
I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.” Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance.
I know too well that I get on Lucy’s nerves.
Our tour was a failure.
She wanted to leave Florence, and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.” “Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe.
“I want your advice.” “Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to him, though familiar to Lucy.
“I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?” Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd woman really did know.
“She must not stop here a moment, and we must keep quiet till she goes.
I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already.
Only, Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone.
If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—” “Otherwise—?” “Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.” Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude.
The tavern sign—a beehive trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him.
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another man” that would have attracted a grosser mind.
He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form.
Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry.
His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.
“They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure.
In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity.
The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement.
Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the action of others.
The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey.
He conversed on indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants; Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could literature influence life?
Windy Corner glimmered.
In the garden, Mrs. Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly.
“This comes of putting off.
We might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece.
I don’t know what the world’s coming to.” “Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must.
Come up to the house and let’s talk it over.
Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?” “Mr.
Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.” “So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good.
Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone.
It was expensive and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed.
Nor would Charlotte have succeeded.
The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right.
It must be something I can’t understand.
Lucy!
Let’s tell her.
Lucy!” “She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said.
He opened the door, and heard the words of a song: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.” “I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.” “Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——” “It’s a song that Cecil gave her.
How odd girls are!” “What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly.
She went into the drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.” Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a bit.” “And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you.” “Oh, splendid!
Oh, thank you!” Mr. Beebe followed.
Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys.
She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness.
Her mother bent over her.
Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_, in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and therefore ignored by the art of to-day.
Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens,” she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.” “Mr.
Beebe knows my rude ways.” “It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he.
“Go on.” “It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly.
“I forget why—harmony or something.” “I suspected it was unscholarly.
It’s so beautiful.” “The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten.
Why throw up the sponge?” “How stupidly you talk!” said his sister.
The _Santa Conversazione_ was broken up.
After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.” “Stop thine ear against the singer—” “Wait a minute; she is finishing.” “From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” “I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear.
She had behaved splendidly, and he had helped her.
He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl’s life.
If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—” Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly.
He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned: “Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX Lying to Mr. Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial England.
They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books, mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.
Miss Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one’s face in the train.
Lucy promised, a little depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.
A gentleman is such a stand-by.” Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine continued.
“It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.
But perhaps he will come out and join you later on.” “Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off.
I do so long to see him.” “No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“She doesn’t like it.” “No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really?
How funny!
I should have thought that in this case—” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going?
It is such a pleasure to have met you!” They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right.
We just got through that time.” But her mother was annoyed.
“I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it.
There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.” Lucy had plenty to say in reply.
She described the Miss Alans’ character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?” “Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then.
It’s much pleasanter.
How wet it is!
Let’s turn in here.” “Here” was the British Museum.
Mrs. Honeychurch refused.
If they must take shelter, let it be in a shop.
Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.
Let’s go to Mudie’s.
I’ll buy a guide-book.” “You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this hole-and-corner work.
You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute.
But why not announce it?
Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?” “It’s only for a few days.” “But why at all?” Lucy was silent.
She was drifting away from her mother.
It was quite easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the incidental advantage of being true.
But she could not say it.
She disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors—Light.
Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent.
She was thinking, “My daughter won’t answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me.
Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.” This was perfectly true.
Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no longer.
It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.
She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk!
Of course I’m not tired of Windy Corner.” “Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?” She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.” “Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?” “Hush, mother!
People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s.
She bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
You see, I come into my money next year.” Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed “eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear.
“I’ve seen the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy.
I have seen so little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like to-day, but to stop.
I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl.” “And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police.
And call it a Mission—when no one wants you!
And call it Duty—when it means that you can’t stand your own home!
And call it Work—when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is!
And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.” “I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys.
But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well.
Take your independence and be gone.
Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.” Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed.
“How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!” “_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.
“More every moment.” “I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike.” “Well, I see the likeness.
The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters.” “What rubbish!
And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you asked her to stop.
I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.” Lucy clenched her teeth.
“My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked Charlotte to stop.
I wish you would keep to the point.” And the conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station.
It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy.
Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful.
“The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked.
For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old mother.
“We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining.
Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was blurred by the soft road.
“_Can’t_ we have the hood down?” she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck.
But now that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?” “It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?” “Yes, miss, they have gone.” Lucy sank back.
The carriage stopped at the Rectory.
She got out to call for Miss Bartlett.
So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary.
Waste!
That word seemed to sum up the whole of life.
Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded her mother.
Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible.
Other people had.
When the maid opened the door, she was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a great favour: might she go to church?
Mr. Beebe and his mother had already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily.
“I forgot it was Friday.
Let’s all go.
Powell can go round to the stables.” “Lucy dearest—” “No church for me, thank you.” A sigh, and they departed.
The church was invisible, but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour.
This was a stained window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation.
Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?
There was only that one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait, sir.” Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips.
George she had faced, and could have faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry!
George is so sorry!
He thought he had a right to try.
I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first.
He ought not to have tried.
I knew nothing about it at all.” If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand.
“But you must not scold him.” Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love.
I said: ‘When love comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind.
No.
Passion is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my day is over, and though there is the result.
Poor boy!
He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that whatever you felt you did not mean.
Yet”—his voice gathered strength: he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?” Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries.
Holding it up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son.” “But you do remember it?” “He has misbehaved himself from the first.” “I only was told that he loved you last Sunday.
I never could judge behaviour.
I—I—suppose he has.” Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to him.
His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said.
“I am glad he is sorry.
Do you know what he did?” “Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction.
“He only tried when he should not have tried.
You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are going to marry the man you love.
Do not go out of George’s life saying he is abominable.” “No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong.
I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all.
My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late—” “Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?” “Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.” “As his mother did.” “But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr.
Emerson_—what are you talking about?” “When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round.
She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered.
“Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in again!
A judgement!
And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church!
Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch?
Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever?” “I don’t know,” gasped Lucy.
“I don’t understand this sort of thing.
I was not meant to understand it.” “But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his principles.
I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was well she was ill.
He made her think about sin, and she went under thinking about it.” It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man.
“I did hold firm.” And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what cost!—he had won a victory over them.
“My boy shall go back to the earth untouched.” She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill. “Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present.
“George last Sunday—no, not ill: just gone under.
He is never ill.
But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
It was always touch and go.
He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live.
He will never think anything worth while.
You remember that church at Florence?” Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible.
Then we took the house here, and he goes bathing with your brother, and became better.
You saw him bathing?” “I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair.
I am deeply sorry about it.” “Then there came something about a novel.
I didn’t follow it at all; I had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old.
Ah, well, one must have failures.
George comes down to-morrow, and takes me up to his London rooms.
He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be where he is.” “Mr.
Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my account.
I am going to Greece.
Don’t leave your comfortable house.” It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled.
“How good everyone is!
And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning and heard I was going!
Here I am so comfortable with a fire.” “Yes, but you won’t go back to London.
It’s absurd.” “I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he can’t.
He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t.
I’ve been bother enough to the world by now.
I can’t have you moving out of your house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my account.
You must stop!
I am just going to Greece.” “All the way to Greece?” Her manner altered.
“To Greece?” “So you must stop.
You won’t talk about this business, I know.
I can trust you both.” “Certainly you can.
We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the life that you have chosen.” “I shouldn’t want—” “I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George?
No, it was wrong of George to try.
We have pushed our beliefs too far.
I fancy that we deserve sorrow.” She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling.
To Lucy who could not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still.
I think I will sit in the carriage.” “Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.” “Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you.
And what were you saying about going abroad?” She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands.
Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you.
I hope—it isn’t because George spoke that you are both going?” “No.” “I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.” “Thank you.” At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church.
His cassock was covered with rain.
“That’s all right,” he said kindly.
“I counted on you two keeping each other company.
It’s pouring again.
The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it.
Did Powell go round?” “I think so; I’ll see.” “No—of course, I’ll see.
How are the Miss Alans?” “Very well, thank you.” “Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?” “I—I did.” “Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the two Miss Alans?
Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm.
I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely.
“I made a slip.
Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England.” Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man.
To George, to Cecil, she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece.
And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving him?
You are leaving the man you love?” “I—I had to.” “Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?” Terror came over her, and she lied again.
She made the long, convincing speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more.
He heard her in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.
It seems to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.” She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world.
It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so dreadful.
It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the things that I might have avoided.
We can help one another but little.
I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle.
Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren’t?
Do you remember before, when you refused the room with the view?
Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent.
“Don’t trust me, Miss Honeychurch.
Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was still silent.
“‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’ I think he puts it well.
Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean.
You love George!” And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
“You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
You won’t marry the other man for his sake.” “How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man.” “But you are.” She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.
It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way.
You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat.
I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and _for which_ you marry.
I know that, with George, you will find them, and that you love him.
Then be his wife.
He is already part of you.
Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part.
You will wish that it was.
You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.
I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the body.
Ah!
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that!
Ah!
for a little directness to liberate the soul!
Your soul, dear Lucy!
I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round.
But we have souls.
I cannot say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining yours.
I cannot bear it.
It is again the darkness creeping in; it is hell.” Then he checked himself.
“What nonsense I have talked—how abstract and remote!
And I have made you cry!
Dear girl, forgive my prosiness; marry my boy.
When I think what life is, and how seldom love is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made.” She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.
Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
“Cecil—Mr.
Beebe—the ticket’s bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair.
“I’m caught in the tangle.
I must suffer and grow old away from him.
I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
They trusted me.” A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only.
Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—” “No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—” “But why should they, when you have deceived them?” Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.” “You’re not worthy of their trust.” “What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?” “One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson.
To whom do you refer?
Trust whom?” “I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George.
They have loved one another all along.” Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman.
A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?” “Mr.
Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—” “Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!” “It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly.
“It’s the part of people that you don’t understand.” Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy!
Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr.
Beebe, could you help me?” He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am more grieved than I can possibly express.
It is lamentable, lamentable—incredible.” “What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me.
Marry George, Miss Honeychurch.
He will do admirably.” He walked out and left them.
They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair.
But his face revived her.
It was the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark.
Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know.
But remember the mountains over Florence and the view.
Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise.
George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him.
Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.” “You kiss me,” said the girl.
“You kiss me.
I will try.” He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his salutation remained.
He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he managed to strengthen her.
It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once.” Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves.
They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf.
They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity.
Trembling, anxious, cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go round the world.
The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had your father’s room.
I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.” He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.” “Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window.
It was evening and again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully.
“What can such people be made of?” “Same stuff as parsons are made of.” “Nonsense!” “Quite right.
It is nonsense.” “Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.” “Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and advancing his face to hers.
“What’s there to cry at?
Kiss me here.” He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all.
When it came to the point, it was she who remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who knew whose room this had been last year.
It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.” “Now kiss me here; then here.” Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window, opened it (as the English will), and leant out.
There was the parapet, there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills.
The cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago.
A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool.
He had helped himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its name is, still shows.” “San Miniato.
I’ll just finish your sock.” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils, the Miss Bartletts!
Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?” “Not yet.” His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?” “Silly boy!
He thinks he’s being dignified.
He knew we should go off in the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands.
They had fair warning, and now he calls it an elopement.
Ridiculous boy—” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” “But it will all come right in the end.
He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women.
He has, for the second time, quite altered.
Why will men have theories about women?
I haven’t any about men.
I wish, too, that Mr. Beebe—” “You may well wish that.” “He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us again.
I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner.
I wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run.” “Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only thing I did do—and you came back to me.
So possibly you know.” He turned back into the room.
“Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to the window, so that she, too, saw all the view.
They sank upon their knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one another’s names.
Ah!
it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—” “Oh, bother that man!” But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte.
How cruel she would be to a man like that!” “Look at the lights going over the bridge.” “But this room reminds me of Charlotte.
How horrible to grow old in Charlotte’s way!
To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house.
For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
You couldn’t have made me.
When I am very happy”—she kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs.
If Charlotte had only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to silly Greece, and become different for ever.” “But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely.
He said so.” “Oh, no, she didn’t see him.
She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church.
She said so.” George was obstinate again.
“My father,” said he, “saw her, and I prefer his word.
He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett.
A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up.
He didn’t speak to her.” Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other’s arms.
It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting.
George, who disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew.
Then, why did she risk the meeting?
She knew he was there, and yet she went to church.” They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind.
She rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?” “Mean what?” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.” “Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.” “Niente.” The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?” He whispered: “Is it this?
Is this possible?
I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped.
That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down.
That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped.
I can’t explain her any other way.
Can you?
Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable.
The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend.
There are details—it burnt.
I read the book afterwards.
She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through.
She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
We can never make friends with her or thank her.
But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.” “It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.” Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited, love attained.
But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean.
[Illustration] A Room With A View By E. M. Forster CONTENTS PART ONE Chapter I The Bertolini “The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at all.
She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart.
Oh, Lucy!” “And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the Signora’s unexpected accent.
“It might be London.” She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A.
Oxon.
), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London?
I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside.
I suppose it is one’s being so tired.” “This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno.
The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno.
The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!” “Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that you shouldn’t have a view.” Lucy felt that she had been selfish.
“Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of course, you must look over the Arno, too.
I meant that.
The first vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no.
You must have it.” “I insist on it.
Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.” “She would never forgive _me_.” The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a little peevish.
They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled.
Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument.
He said: “I have a view, I have a view.” Miss Bartlett was startled.
Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do” till they had gone.
She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she glanced at him.
He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes.
There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes.
These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim.
So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A view?
Oh, a view!
How delightful a view is!” “This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George.
He has a view too.” “Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have yours.
We’ll change.” The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the new-comers.
Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.” “Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.” “You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy.
Her cousin again repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted.
“Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying, “George, persuade them!” “It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son.
“There’s nothing else to say.” He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful.
Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before.
Now the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change?
What possible objection had she?
They would clear out in half an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless in the presence of brutality.
It was impossible to snub any one so gross.
Her face reddened with displeasure.
She looked around as much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are genteel.” “Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear.
This pension is a failure.
To-morrow we will make a change.” Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it.
The curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for his lateness.
Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh!
Why, it’s Mr. Beebe!
Oh, how perfectly lovely!
Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are.
Oh!” Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint: “How do you do, Mr. Beebe?
I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.” The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him.
But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it.
“Just fancy how small the world is.
Summer Street, too, makes it so specially funny.” “Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—” “Yes, I heard from mother so last week.
She didn’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr.
Beebe is—’” “Quite right,” said the clergyman.
“I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June.
I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.” “Oh, how glad I am!
The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.” “Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.” “I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.” He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons.
He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been there before.
It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the field.
“Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded.
“The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.” “No!” cried a voice from the top of the table.
“Mr.
Beebe, you are wrong.
The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.” “That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin.
“We are in luck.” And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them.
People told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would grow upon them.
The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do.
Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them.
And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato!
They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words.
I love it; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.” The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then returned moodily to his plate.
Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did.
It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow, but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with more than cloth.
Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy, and Victorier, her daughter.
It made a curious little scene, this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house.
Was this really Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which had the colour and the contours of a tomato.
She was talking to Mr. Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle.
“We are most grateful to you,” she was saying.
“The first evening means so much.
When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.” He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner?” “Emerson.” “Is he a friend of yours?” “We are friendly—as one is in pensions.” “Then I will say no more.” He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin, Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing.
His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.” “You acted very naturally,” said he.
He seemed thoughtful, and after a few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have come of accepting.” “No _harm_, of course.
But we could not be under an obligation.” “He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor expect you to show gratitude.
He has the merit—if it is one—of saying exactly what he means.
He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks you would value them.
He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite.
It is so difficult—at least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.” Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so always hope that people will be nice.” “I think he is; nice and tiresome.
I differ from him on almost every point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will differ.
But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores.
When he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up.
He has no tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he will not keep his opinions to himself.
We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of it.” “Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?” Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?” “I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet.
He seems a nice creature, and I think he has brains.
Of course, he has all his father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a Socialist.” “Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett.
“So you think I ought to have accepted their offer?
You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious?” “Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.” “But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent rudeness?” He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary, and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared.
“Why didn’t you talk, Lucy?
He prefers young people, I’m sure.
I do hope I haven’t monopolized him.
I hoped you would have him all the evening, as well as all dinner-time.” “He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Just what I remember.
He seems to see good in everyone.
No one would take him for a clergyman.” “My dear Lucia—” “Well, you know what I mean.
And you know how clergymen generally laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.” “Funny girl!
How you do remind me of your mother.
I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe.” “I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.” “I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable world.
I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind the times.” “Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not determine.
She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered.
Miss Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.” And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must be more careful.
It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.” Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat.
Permission granted, she began to chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning.
She handled her subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room.
It was a real catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea, though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England.
Signora Bertolini is so English.” “Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy.
“We dread going to bed.” “Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed.
“If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful!
We were so sorry for you at dinner.” “I think he was meaning to be kind.” “Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr.
Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature.
Of course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.” “Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool.
No one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know.
No, he is not tactful; yet, have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?” “Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word.
“Are not beauty and delicacy the same?” “So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly.
“But things are so difficult, I sometimes think.” She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms.
I’m so glad.
Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again.
He has let me come and ask you.
He would be so pleased.” “Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious.
I must apologize for my interference.” Gravely displeased, he turned to go.
Not till then did Miss Bartlett reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with yours.
It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence, when I am only here through your kindness.
If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it.
Would you then, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?” She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines.
The clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this.
I do not wish the acceptance to come from you.
Grant me that, at all events.” Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously: “Mr.
Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.” The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him personally.
But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out.” Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath.
All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first.
Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms!
It is all he can do to keep polite.” “In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe.
Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment.
“Gentlemen sometimes do not realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part.
Lucy, not realizing either, was reduced to literature.
Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy, she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow.
Thus the half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a sigh, and said: “I think one might venture now.
No, Lucy, do not stir.
I will superintend the move.” “How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear.
It is my affair.” “But I would like to help you.” “No, dear.” Charlotte’s energy!
And her unselfishness!
She had been thus all her life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself.
So Lucy felt, or strove to feel.
And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful.
At all events, she entered her own room without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken the largest room.
Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure your mother would not like it.” Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him.
I am a woman of the world, in my small way, and I know where things lead to.
However, Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.” “Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night.
It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato, and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances.
It was then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation.
Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle.
Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing, obnoxious, portentous with evil.
She was seized with an impulse to destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so, since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson.
So she unpinned it carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him.
Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II In Santa Croce with No Baedeker It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons.
It was pleasant, too, to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for some mysterious end.
An electric tram came rushing underneath the window.
No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand.
Children tried to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their faces to make them let go.
Then soldiers appeared—good-looking, undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier.
Beside them walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band.
The tramcar became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants.
One of the little boys fell down, and some white bullocks came out of an archway.
Indeed, if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it.
So it was as well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the best of the day would be gone.
By the time Lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines.
Miss Bartlett was, after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out?
Lucy would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but, of course, she could go alone.
Miss Bartlett could not allow this.
Of course she would accompany Lucy everywhere.
Oh, certainly not; Lucy would stop with her cousin.
Oh, no!
that would never do.
Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you can neglect the good person.
Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe.
Italians understand.
A dear friend of mine, Contessa Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead.
Every one takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly behind.” Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s daughters.
She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being so very bad.
The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.” Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut!
Miss Lucy!
I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker.
He does but touch the surface of things.
As to the true Italy—he does not even dream of it.
The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.” This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and started with her new friend in high spirits.
Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right along the sunny Lung’ Arno.
How delightfully warm!
But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it?
Ponte alle Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante.
San Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story.
The men on the river were fishing.
(Untrue; but then, so is most information.)
Then Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she stopped, and she cried: “A smell!
a true Florentine smell!
Every city, let me teach you, has its own smell.” “Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes for life.
Buon giorno!
Buon giorno!” bowing right and left.
“Look at that adorable wine-cart!
How the driver stares at us, dear, simple soul!” So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence, short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s grace.
It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears, only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno!
Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors.
_That_ is the true democracy.
Though I am a real Radical as well.
There, now you’re shocked.” “Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy.
“We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful about Ireland.” “I see, I see.
And now you have gone over to the enemy.” “Oh, please—!
If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right.
And as it is, the glass over our front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.” “Shameful!
A manufacturing district, I suppose?” “No—in the Surrey hills.
About five miles from Dorking, looking over the Weald.” Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well.
It is full of the very nicest people.
Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there was?” “Very well indeed.” “And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?” “Why, she rents a field of us!
How funny!” Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you have property in Surrey?” “Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob.
“Only thirty acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.” Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her aunt’s Suffolk estate.
Italy receded.
They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her.
And just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed: “Bless us!
Bless us and save us!
We’ve lost the way.” Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window.
But Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost!
lost!
My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning.
How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do?
Two lone females in an unknown town.
Now, this is what _I_ call an adventure.” Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution, that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven!
And no, you are not, not, _not_ to look at your Baedeker.
Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it.
We will simply drift.” Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets, neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds.
Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa, and became discontented herself.
For one ravishing moment Italy appeared.
She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale.
There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven.
Lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop, because it looked so typical.
It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the great unknown.
But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza, large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white façade of surpassing ugliness.
Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically.
It was Santa Croce.
The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to them.
I do detest conventional intercourse.
Nasty!
they are going into the church, too.
Oh, the Britisher abroad!” “We sat opposite them at dinner last night.
They have given us their rooms.
They were so very kind.” “Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish.
“They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows.
It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who couldn’t pass it.” “What would you ask us?” Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest that she, at all events, would get full marks.
In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried: “There goes my local-colour box!
I must have a word with him!” And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes.
Then she began to get tired.
The beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places.
She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was really almost too original.
But at that moment Miss Lavish and her local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both gesticulating largely.
Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her Baedeker.
How could she find her way home?
How could she find her way about in Santa Croce?
Her first morning was ruined, and she might never be in Florence again.
A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits, talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was full of originality.
Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans.
Of course, it must be a wonderful building.
But how like a barn!
And how very cold!
Of course, it contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper.
But who was to tell her which they were?
She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date.
There was no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she began to be happy.
She puzzled out the Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves, not to spit.
She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce.
She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed.
Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then retreated.
What could this mean?
They did it again and again.
Then Lucy realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to acquire virtue.
Punishment followed quickly.
The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward.
She was too late.
He fell heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had darted forward also.
“Hard in life, hard in death.
Go out into the sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where you ought to be.
Intolerable bishop!” The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy.
“Here’s a mess: a baby hurt, cold, and frightened!
But what else can you expect from a church?” The child’s legs had become as melting wax.
Each time that old Mr. Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar.
Fortunately an Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the rescue.
By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his knees.
He stood.
Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson.
“You have done more than all the relics in the world.
I am not of your creed, but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy.
There is no scheme of the universe—” He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons.
She was determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and, if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply.
“But what are you doing here?
Are you doing the church?
Are you through with the church?” “No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance.
“I came here with Miss Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come in by myself.” “Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.” “Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson.
“I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded.
It’s worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker.
_That’s_ worth minding.” Lucy was puzzled.
She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this where the idea would lead?
She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that.
I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you.
I really came to help with the child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.” “My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say.
You are pretending to be touchy; but you are not really.
Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see.
To take you to it will be a real pleasure.” Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been furious.
But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it.
Lucy could not get cross.
Mr. Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him.
On the other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him.
It was at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope.
It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you will kindly tell me which they are.” The son nodded.
With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel.
There was a hint of the teacher about him.
She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared.
Observe how Giotto in these frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective.
Could anything be more majestic, more pathetic, beautiful, true?
How little, we feel, avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!” “No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort!
Built by faith indeed!
That simply means the workmen weren’t paid properly.
And as for the frescoes, I see no truth in them.
Look at that fat man in blue!
He must weigh as much as I do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.” He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside, the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might.
The audience shifted uneasily, and so did Lucy.
She was sure that she ought not to be with these men; but they had cast a spell over her.
They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it?
Yes or no?” George replied: “It happened like this, if it happened at all.
I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.” “You will never go up,” said his father.
“You and I, dear boy, will lie at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives.” “Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint, whoever he is, going up.
It did happen like that, if it happened at all.” “Pardon me,” said a frigid voice.
“The chapel is somewhat small for two parties.
We will incommode you no longer.” The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock, for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands.
They filed out of the chapel in silence.
Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“There’s plenty of room for us all.
Stop!” The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.” George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is.
I don’t remember.” “Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am.
It’s that Mr.
Eager.
Why did he go?
Did we talk too loud?
How vexatious.
I shall go and say we are sorry.
Hadn’t I better?
Then perhaps he will come back.” “He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the Rev.
Cuthbert Eager.
Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent.
The son, who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her.
“He will try to be kind.” “I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters.
But he is kind to people because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or frightened.” “How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I think that a kind action done tactfully—” “Tact!” He threw up his head in disdain.
Apparently she had given the wrong answer.
She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon it—hard.
Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness.
She saw him once again at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of acorns.
Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness, of tragedy that might only find solution in the night.
The feeling soon passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle.
Born of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned, and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people.
They won’t come back.” “...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy.
“Have you looked at those saints?” “Yes,” said Lucy.
“They are lovely.
Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin?” He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls.
There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists.
But Mr. Emerson was only half interested.
He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily.
“I saw nothing in it.” “I like Giotto,” she replied.
“It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values.
Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better.” “So you ought.
A baby is worth a dozen saints.
And my baby’s worth the whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.” Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated.
“He’s unhappy.” “Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive?
What more is one to give him?
And think how he has been brought up—free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God.
With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to grow up happy.” She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old man, as well as a very irreligious one.
She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked.
“He comes out for his holiday to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone.
Eh?
What did you say?” Lucy had made no suggestion.
Suddenly he said: “Now don’t be stupid over this.
I don’t require you to fall in love with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him.
You are nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me.
He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose?
But let yourself go.
You are inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night.
Let yourself go.
Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand, and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them.
By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself.
It will be good for both of you.” To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.” “And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.” “What things?” “The things of the universe.
It is quite true.
They don’t.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?” In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry, he said: “‘From far, from eve and morning, The stuff of life to knit me George and I both know this, but why does it distress him?
We know that we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness.
But why should this make us unhappy?
Let us rather love one another, and work and rejoice.
I don’t believe in this world sorrow.” Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us.
Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a Yes.” Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.
A young man melancholy because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind, or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried.
“You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then she became matronly.
“Oh, but your son wants employment.
Has he no particular hobby?
Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother.
Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes.” The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it.
Indeed, he no longer alarmed her at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly.
Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically, before she lost Baedeker.
The dear George, now striding towards them over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd.
He approached, his face in the shadow.
He said: “Miss Bartlett.” “Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective.
“Where?
Where?” “In the nave.” “I see.
Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson.
“Poor girl!” She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling herself.
“Poor girl?
I fail to understand the point of that remark.
I think myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you.
I’m thoroughly happy, and having a splendid time.
Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to invent it.
Good-bye.
Thank you both so much for all your kindness.
Ah, yes!
there does come my cousin.
A delightful morning!
Santa Croce is a wonderful church.” She joined her cousin.
Chapter III Music, Violets, and the Letter “S” It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered a more solid world when she opened the piano.
She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected.
The commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom.
Lucy had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation.
Nor was she the passionate young lady, who performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the pictorial style.
And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory.
Victory of what and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano.
A few people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep.
She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for her cigarette-case.
Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it.
It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower.
The seats were filled with a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork.
Among the promised items was “Miss Honeychurch.
Piano.
Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III.
He was in suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends.
With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory.
He was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen.
The audience clapped, no less respectful.
It was Mr. Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners.
I do not consider her choice of a piece happy.
Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if anything, disturbs.” “Introduce me.” “She will be delighted.
She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon.” “My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe.
“Why ever did she listen to it?” When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch, disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face.
She loved going to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and meringues.
He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also.
But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him: “If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting both for us and for her.” Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing!
Some one said just the same to mother, and she said she trusted I should never live a duet.” “Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?” “She doesn’t mind it.
But she doesn’t like one to get excited over anything; she thinks I am silly about it.
She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any one’s.
She has never got over it.
Of course, I didn’t mean that I played well; I only meant—” “Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality.
She could not complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet.
The whole life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey, and the hills were dirty purple.
Somewhere in their folds were concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold, tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and a tickling cough in her throat.
On another day, when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray.
She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe.” “Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy.
This was a stock remark, the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition.
Miss Lavish was so original.
Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness.
For that, and for other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is writing a book?” “They do say so.” “What is it about?” “It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know.” “I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself.
We started such friends.
But I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce.
Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.” “The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.” He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish.
They were always in each other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third.
Miss Lavish he believed he understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning.
Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells?
All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work.
Girls like Lucy were charming to look at, but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped.
The Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore.
But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse.
She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill!
And Mr. Beebe here besides.
Who would suppose this is Italy?
There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.” She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in my room with the door shut.
Doors shut; indeed, most necessary.
No one has the least idea of privacy in this country.
And one person catches it from another.” Lucy answered suitably.
Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.
The Italians are a most unpleasant people.
They pry everywhere, they see everything, and they know what we want before we know it ourselves.
We are at their mercy.
They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires.
From the cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial!
They have no conception of the intellectual life.
How right is Signora Bertolini, who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I suffer over the children’s edjucaishion.
_Hi_ won’t ’ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’” Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way.
Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers.
Indeed, who would have supposed that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last the cause was disclosed.
From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “E.
L.” “That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman.
“A good fellow, Lavish, but I wish she’d start a pipe.” “Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose.
She took to it, practically in despair, after her life’s work was carried away in a landslip.
Surely that makes it more excusable.” “What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice novel.
It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I must say they nearly always do.
Anyhow, she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink.
She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written.
The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got tempted into cigarettes.
It is a great secret, but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel.
She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not start till she had an idea.
First she tried Perugia for an inspiration, then she came here—this must on no account get round.
And so cheerful through it all!
I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.” Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring.
She felt she had made almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.” Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole, the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade.
That old Mr. Emerson, who puts things very strangely—” Her jaw dropped.
She was silent.
Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a hasty whisper: “Stomach.
He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and he may have meant to be kind.
I must say I forgot myself and laughed; it was so sudden.
As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter.
But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different grades of thought.
She thought they were commercial travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on nothing but commerce.
Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson.
Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ Just imagine!
‘Tut!
The early Victorians.’ My sister had gone, and I felt bound to speak.
I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking.
I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply.
But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman!
I tell things so badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place.
But that was not all.
After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers.” “Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I shall go alone.’ She went.
At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.” “Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows.
No one will ever know.
Miss Lavish will never dare to tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.” “Mr.
Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice?
I do so want to know.” Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself.
“No; but it is so difficult.
Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do not mind him.
Miss Alan, what do you think?
Is he nice?” The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly.
Mr. Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying: “I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after that business of the violets.” “Violets?
Oh, dear!
Who told you about the violets?
How do things get round?
A pension is a bad place for gossips.
No, I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce.
Oh, poor Miss Honeychurch!
It really was too bad.
No, I have quite changed.
I do _not_ like the Emersons.
They are _not_ nice.” Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly.
He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed.
He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them.
Miss Lavish, who represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans, who stood for good breeding, were following her.
Miss Bartlett, smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil.
The case of Lucy was different.
She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows and joys.
This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail.
After all, he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now.
Even their seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once.
Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite politely, of course.” “Most right of her.
They don’t understand our ways.
They must find their level.” Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under.
They had given up their attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost as silent as the son.
He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them.
It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle.
There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief.
“All the galleries are shut.” “I think I shall go out,” said Lucy.
“I want to go round the town in the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.” Her two companions looked grave.
Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say: “I wish we could.
Unluckily I have letters.
If you do want to go out alone, won’t you be better on your feet?” “Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!” But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her from the window, “and she knows it.
I put it down to too much Beethoven.” Chapter IV Fourth Chapter Mr. Beebe was right.
Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music.
She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan.
Conversation was tedious; she wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram.
This she might not attempt.
It was unladylike.
Why?
Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why.
It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different.
Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much.
But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured, then despised, and finally ignored.
Poems had been written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady.
The dragons have gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst.
She reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early Victorian song.
It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas!
the creature grows degenerate.
In her heart also there are springing up strange desires.
She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea.
She has marked the kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the receding heavens.
Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are alive.
Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious.
Nor has she any system of revolt.
Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that she had done so.
This afternoon she was peculiarly restive.
She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved.
As she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus, being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it.
(A pity in art of course signified the nude.)
Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it.
She felt a little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s “Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni Madonnas.
For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed still unopened.
She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her to be conscious of it.
“The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to her.
The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to strike it.
Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god, half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge.
The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind.
It was the hour of unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real.
An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him, and rest content.
Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold.
It seemed no longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky.
Its brightness mesmerized her, still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt.
“Cinque lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest.
He frowned; he bent towards Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for her.
He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all.
A crowd rose out of the dusk.
It hid this extraordinary man from her, and bore him away to the fountain.
Mr. George Emerson happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where the man had been.
How very odd!
Across something.
Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her, fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?” “Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything.
She had complained of dullness, and lo!
one man was stabbed, and another held her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade.
He must have carried her.
He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees.
She repeated: “Oh, what have I done?” “You fainted.” “I—I am very sorry.” “How are you now?” “Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home.
There’s no point in our stopping.” He held out his hand to pull her up.
She pretended not to see it.
The cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily.
The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been!
I might have hurt myself falling.
But now I am well.
I can go alone, thank you.” His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?” “I bought some photographs at Alinari’s.
I must have dropped them out there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously.
“Would you add to your kindness by fetching them?” He added to his kindness.
As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!” She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.” “Yes, I am, thank you so very much.” “No, you aren’t.
You’d go openly if you were.” “But I had rather—” “Then I don’t fetch your photographs.” “I had rather be alone.” He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him.
“And don’t move till I come back.” In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in dreams.
The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day, and joined itself to earth.
How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he returned from the shadowy square?
Again the thought occurred to her, “Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man, had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder.
Oddly enough, it was an easy topic.
She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before.
Being strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood.
She rose without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her, she walked firmly enough towards the Arno.
There a cabman signalled to them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians are!—and gave himself up to the police!
Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish.
When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?” He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?” “Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr.
Emerson!” “Well?” “Where are the photographs?” He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.” “I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that of an anxious boy.
Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood.
There!
I’m glad I’ve told you; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them.” He pointed down-stream.
“They’ve gone.” The river swirled under the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man.
“For something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting muddled.
It isn’t exactly that a man has died.” Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.” “Mr.
Emerson—” He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.” They were close to their pension.
She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment.
He did likewise.
There is at times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship.
She moved her elbows before saying: “I have behaved ridiculously.” He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what came over me.” “I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.” “Oh, all right.” “And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?” “I’m afraid I don’t.” “I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?” “Your behaviour?
Oh, yes, all right—all right.” “Thank you so much.
And would you—” She could not carry her request any further.
The river was rushing below them, almost black in the advancing night.
He had thrown her photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason.
It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man.
He would do her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even kind; he might even have a high opinion of her.
But he lacked chivalry; his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe.
It was useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture.
She had been in his arms, and he remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari’s shop.
It was not exactly that a man had died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents do happen, and then one returns to the old life!” “I don’t.” Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.” “But why, Mr. Emerson?
What do you mean?” “I shall want to live, I say.” Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno, whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson.
She and Miss Lavish had had an adventure also.
They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions.
It might have been most unpleasant.
Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone.
None of her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the embankment.
Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure, not that she had encountered it.
This solitude oppressed her; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events, contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action.
There were two plans between which she had to choose.
Mr. Beebe was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies.
Would Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party?
Charlotte declined for herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon.
But she thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth.
“It’s very kind of Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you.
I had much rather.” “Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.
How abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always!
But now she should alter.
All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the Lung’ Arno.
The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and colour.
Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it.
She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this, too!” Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did.
“Look, Lucia!
Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party.
I feared you would repent you of your choice.” Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent.
Yesterday had been a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del Gallo.
Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not to re-enter it.
She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately remained.
Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria.
She could not have believed that stones, a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance.
For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand.
She hailed them briskly.
The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett.
“After your despair of yesterday!
What a fortunate thing!” “Aha!
Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck.
Now, you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?” “I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.” The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless creatures.
I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we wouldn’t pry.” She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few calculations in realism.
Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o’clock collecting material.
A good deal of it was unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt.
The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note.
For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.” That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?” Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot.
But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish concluded.
“It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people.
Of course, this is the barest outline.
There will be a deal of local colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall also introduce some humorous characters.
And let me give you all fair warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.” “Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett.
“I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons.” Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can.
For I repeat and I insist, and I have always held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life.” There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded.
Then the cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett.
“That last remark struck me as so particularly true.
It should be a most pathetic novel.” Lucy assented.
At present her great aim was not to get put into it.
Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,” continued Miss Bartlett slowly.
“None but the superficial would be shocked at her.
We had a long talk yesterday.
She believes in justice and truth and human interest.
She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr.
Eager!
Why, how nice!
What a pleasant surprise!” “Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.” “We were chatting to Miss Lavish.” His brow contracted.
“So I saw.
Were you indeed?
Andate via!
sono occupato!” The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile.
“I am about to venture a suggestion.
Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a drive in the hills?
We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour’s ramble on the hillside.
The view thence of Florence is most beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole.
It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape.
Decidedly.
But who looks at it to-day?
Ah, the world is too much for us.” Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that Mr.
Eager was no commonplace chaplain.
He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home.
He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of, and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent.
Tea at a Renaissance villa?
Nothing had been said about it yet.
But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same.
But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew.
A drive in the hills with Mr.
Eager and Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no longer the greatest of them.
She echoed the raptures of Charlotte somewhat faintly.
Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain.
“In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity.
Andate via!
andate presto, presto!
Ah, the town!
Beautiful as it is, it is the town.” They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies.
To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and humiliating.” “Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened.
She can hardly bear to speak of it.” She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question.
“Do not blame her, please, Mr.
Eager.
The fault is mine: I left her unchaperoned.” “So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable.
His dark, handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.” “One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience.
I trust that neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?” Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood.
George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—” “Were over at the Loggia.” “That must have saved you much.
You have not, of course, seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.” Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal league of Italy with youth.
He had suddenly extended his book before Miss Bartlett and Mr.
Eager, binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico’s angels.
She tore.
A shrill cry rose from the vendor.
The book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr.
Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a grievance.
His mysterious persecution of Mr.
Eager became relentless; the air rang with his threats and lamentations.
He appealed to Lucy; would not she intercede?
He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on bread.
He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied, he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued.
Under the chaplain’s guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy.
She had been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr.
Eager, she knew not why.
And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased to respect them.
She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great artist.
She doubted that Mr.
Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose.
They were tried by some new test, and they were found wanting.
As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte she was exactly the same.
It might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact.
A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press.
I came across him at Brixton.” They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr.
Eager, “one has only sympathy for their success.
The desire for education and for social advance—in these things there is something not wholly vile.
There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as they would make of it.” “Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.” He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.” “Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead.
I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with me.
He was in my London parish long ago.
The other day in Santa Croce, when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him.
Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub.” “What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr.
Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended.
Miss Bartlett was full of very natural curiosity.
Lucy, though she wished never to see the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man?
We know that already.” “Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all.
The boy—an innocent child at the time—I will exclude.
God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him.” “Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not hear.” “To speak plainly,” said Mr.
Eager, “it is.
I will say no more.” For the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the first time in her life.
“You have said very little.” “It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved quickly.
He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips.
It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily.
“That man murdered his wife!” “How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her.
That day in Santa Croce—did they say anything against me?” “Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.” “Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you.
But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them.” “I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing into the old chaotic methods.
“They’re nothing to me.” “How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene.
The shopman was possibly listening.
“She will find it difficult.
For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God.” The addition of God was striking.
But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark.
A silence followed which might have been impressive, but was merely awkward.
Then Miss Bartlett hastily purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive.
“Drive?
Oh, is our drive to come off?” Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr.
Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed.
“It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all.
Why should he invite us in that absurd manner?
We might as well invite him.
We are each paying for ourselves.” Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish.” “How?” “Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.” “That will mean another carriage.” “Far worse.
Mr.
Eager does not like Eleanor.
She knows it herself.
The truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.” They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank.
Lucy stood by the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer, or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain.
The well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets?
Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it.
Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck.
She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank.
As she groped she murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr.
Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we must be prepared.
It is you they really want; I am only asked for appearances.
You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor will follow behind.
A one-horse carriage would do for us.
Yet how difficult it is!” “It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.” “Oh, dear, Lucy!
I do hope Florence isn’t boring you.
Speak the word, and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.” “Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her mother’s letters could be.
She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway.
She recalled the free, pleasant life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where nothing ever happened to her.
The road up through the pine-woods, the clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs.
Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news that interested her least.
“Do you know the Vyses?” “Oh, not that way back.
We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria.” “They’re nice people, the Vyses.
So clever—my idea of what’s really clever.
Don’t you long to be in Rome?” “I die for it!” The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant.
It has no grass, no flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick.
By an odd chance—unless we believe in a presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity.
Perseus and Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something, and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after experience, not before.
Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly.
“Here’s an idea.
What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel?
For I do know what I want.
I’m sick of Florence.
No, you said you’d go to the ends of the earth!
Do!
Do!” Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied: “Oh, you droll person!
Pray, what would become of your drive in the hills?” They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson, Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up the stony hill.
Mr. Beebe recognized him at once.
Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany driving a cab.
And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light.
To her Mr.
Eager objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard against imposition.
But the ladies interceded, and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist.
She did not mind.
Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy.
The other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss Lavish.
For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without consulting Mr.
Eager, had doubled the size of the party.
And though Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus transformed.
Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it, was now impossible.
Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts.
But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr.
Eager, repressive towards Miss Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring.
She looked on the expedition as the work of Fate.
But for it she would have avoided George Emerson successfully.
In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy.
She had refused, not because she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he did know.
And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia, but by the river.
To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled emotion, but of the whole fabric.
There was really something blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word.
This sense of wickedness had been slight at first.
She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo.
But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative that she should avoid him again.
And now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr.
Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling?
As a student of art?” “Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!” “Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like myself?” “Oh, no.
I am here as a tourist.” “Oh, indeed,” said Mr.
Eager.
“Are you indeed?
If you will not think me rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’ or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else.
The result is, they mix up towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl.
You know the American girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog.’ There’s travelling for you.
Ha!
ha!
ha!” “I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit.
“The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.” “Quite so.
Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are here for trade, for example.
But the greater part are students.
Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico.
I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left.
No, you can only see it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall.
She is very proud of that thick hedge.
Inside, perfect seclusion.
One might have gone back six hundred years.
Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?” “It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish.
“Tell me, where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day?” But Mr.
Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right lived Mr.
Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill.
“Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’?
He is working at Gemistus Pletho.
Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.” During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully.
Lucy had a spasm of envy.
Granted that they wished to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so.
They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition.
The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road.
“Piano!
piano!” said Mr.
Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped his horses up again.
Now Mr.
Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or was he one of its manifestations?
The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr. Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine.
“Piano!
piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat.
Phaethon, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was most unpleasant.
The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr.
Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but at its manner.
At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and patted them on the back to signify his approval.
And Miss Lavish, though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried.
“But I dare say I shall receive scant support.
I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life.
This is what _I_ call an adventure.” “We must not submit,” said Mr.
Eager.
“I knew he was trying it on.
He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.” “Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood in no awe.
“Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there?
To be driven by lovers—A king might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than anything I know.” Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect.
Mr.
Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will, was determined to make himself heard.
He addressed the driver again.
Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream, with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
In Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker, and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased.
Why should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto.
She pointed at the other carriage.
Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other.
Then Persephone got down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr.
Eager, smiting his hands together as the carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson.
“It is defeat.
You have parted two people who were happy.” Mr.
Eager shut his eyes.
He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but he would not speak to him.
The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took up the matter warmly.
He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money.
He has bargained to drive us, and he is doing it.
We have no rights over his soul.” Miss Lavish frowned.
It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said.
“He jolted us.” “That I deny.
It was as restful as sleeping.
Aha!
he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder?
He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is justified.
And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl, too.
It doesn’t do to injure young people.
Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici?” Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have.
Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature?” “The Lord knows.
Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the poet.
He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t go fighting against the Spring.’” Mr.
Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured.
“‘War not with the May’ would render a correct meaning.” “The point is, we have warred with it.
Look.” He pointed to the Val d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them.
Do you suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man?
But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.” No one encouraged him to talk.
Presently Mr.
Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill.
A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain.
It was this promontory, uncultivated, wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before.
He had ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending.
Standing there, he had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work.
But where exactly had he stood?
That was the question which Mr.
Eager hoped to solve now.
And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
Finally they split into groups.
Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask.
In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio Baldovinetti, but the drive.
Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was very sorry that she had asked him.
She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him.
Mr. Beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish.
“Oh, but I shall die!
Of course it was the railway!” She could not control her mirth.
“He is the image of a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.” “Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion.
“Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—” “I can’t stop.
Let me go my wicked way.
A porter—” “Eleanor!” “I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy.
“The Emersons won’t hear, and they wouldn’t mind if they did.” Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly.
“Pouf!
Wouf!
You naughty girl!
Go away!” “Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr.
Eager, I’m sure.” “I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.” “Mr.
Eager will be offended.
It is your party.” “Please, I’d rather stop here with you.” “No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish.
“It’s like a school feast; the boys have got separated from the girls.
Miss Lucy, you are to go.
We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.” The girl was stubborn.
As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent.
Such a one was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte.
She wished she had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Oh, I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here.” Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm.
Lucy did not look at the view either.
She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish.
“Observe my foresight.” With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy.
The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years.
If I do feel it coming on I shall stand.
Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist.
“Here we are, all settled delightfully.
Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown.
Sit down, dear; you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared her throat.
“Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold.
It’s the tiniest cough, and I have had it three days.
It’s nothing to do with sitting here at all.” There was only one way of treating the situation.
At the end of five minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr.
Eager, vanquished by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars.
The miscreant, a bony young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up.
Of course he knew where.
Not so far either.
His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon.
He should just think he did know where.
He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary.
What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good?
Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings!
He showed her his cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?” She was correct as usual.
He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her.
Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares.
Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets.
She thanked him with real pleasure.
In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct.
For the first time she felt the influence of Spring.
His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?” “Ma buoni uomini.” He bowed.
Certainly.
Good men first, violets afterwards.
They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker.
They were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces.
He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant boughs.
She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness.
Not a step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?” There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them.
The voice of Mr.
Eager?
He shrugged his shoulders.
An Italian’s ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge.
She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen.
The view was forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of the wood.
Light and beauty enveloped her.
She had fallen on to a little open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.” She did not answer.
From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view, and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam.
But never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival.
For a moment he contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven.
He saw radiant joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves.
The bushes above them closed.
He stepped quickly forward and kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called, “Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII They Return Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon.
What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was slow to discover.
Mr.
Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk.
Mr. Emerson, seeking his son, was told whereabouts to find him.
Mr. Beebe, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the return home.
There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment.
Pan had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics.
Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise.
Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett.
Lucy had lost Mr.
Eager.
Mr. Emerson had lost George.
Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh square.
Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable.
He climbed on to the box shivering, with his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather.
“Let us go immediately,” he told them.
“The signorino will walk.” “All the way?
He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently.
I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him.
He alone had played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had used scraps of their intelligence.
He alone had divined what things were, and what he wished them to be.
He alone had interpreted the message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man.
Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could interpret it also.
Not so these English.
They gain knowledge slowly, and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of his employers.
He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents, but infinitely the least dangerous.
Once back in the town, he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more.
Of course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it.
But after all, what have we to do with taverns?
Real menace belongs to the drawing-room.
It was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun.
Lucy sat beside her; Mr.
Eager sat opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious.
They spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together.
The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol.
There was a lightning flash, and Miss Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front.
At the next flash, Lucy screamed also.
Mr.
Eager addressed her professionally: “Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith.
If I might say so, there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements.
Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?” “No—of course—” “Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous.
The steel knives, the only articles which might attract the current, are in the other carriage.
And, in any case, we are infinitely safer than if we were walking.
Courage—courage and faith.” Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand.
At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards.
Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles, gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr.
Eager!” called Mr. Beebe.
“We want your assistance.
Will you interpret for us?” “George!” cried Mr. Emerson.
“Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way.
He may be killed.” “Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver is no help.
Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.” “He may be killed!” cried the old man.
“He may be killed!” “Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage.
“In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.” “What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr.
Eager know?” “Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing.
But—” she pointed at the driver—“_he_ knows everything.
Dearest, had we better?
Shall I?” She took out her purse.
“It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book, she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it.
As well this ending to his day as any.
But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road.
The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen.
If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt.
They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity, which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult.
They descended from the carriages; they embraced each other.
It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them.
For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly.
In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike.
Miss Lavish calculated that, even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the accident.
Mr.
Eager mumbled a temperate prayer.
But the drivers, through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me.
Kiss me again.
Only you can understand me.
You warned me to be careful.
And I—I thought I was developing.” “Do not cry, dearest.
Take your time.” “I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse.
Once by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?” The thought disturbed her repentance.
As a matter of fact, the storm was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not.
One would always pray against that.” “He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that.
I simply slipped into those violets.
No, I want to be really truthful.
I am a little to blame.
I had silly thoughts.
The sky, you know, was gold, and the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a book.” “In a book?” “Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.” “And then?” “But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.” Miss Bartlett was silent.
Indeed, she had little more to learn.
With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her.
All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered.
“It is so hard to be absolutely truthful.” “Don’t be troubled, dearest.
Wait till you are calmer.
We will talk it over before bed-time in my room.” So they re-entered the city with hands clasped.
It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others.
The storm had ceased, and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son.
Mr. Beebe had regained good humour, and Mr.
Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish.
Charlotte alone she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening.
She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it.
All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be carefully laid before her cousin.
And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself.
I shan’t again be troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know what.” Miss Alan asked her to play.
She refused vehemently.
Music seemed to her the employment of a child.
She sat close to her cousin, who, with commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own.
Lucy became rather hysterical with the delay.
In vain she tried to check, or at all events to accelerate, the tale.
It was not till a late hour that Miss Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach: “Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire.
Come into my room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.” With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the girl.
Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?” She was unprepared for the question.
It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything.
A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done?
A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.” The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door.
A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes.
She lifted them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?” “The driver?” “My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.” Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?” “I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.” “I, too, intend to judge him charitably.
But unfortunately I have met the type before.
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.” “Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first?
Come here and listen to me.
I am only gathering it from his own remarks.
Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another?” “Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude.
There is no need to call him a wicked young man, but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined.
Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish.
But we are no farther on with our question.
What do you propose to do?” An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it.
But—as you said—it is my affair.
Mine and his.” “And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?” “Certainly not.
There would be no difficulty.
Whatever you ask him he answers, yes or no; then it is over.
I have been frightened of him.
But now I am not one little bit.” “But we fear him for you, dear.
You are so young and inexperienced, you have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round.
This afternoon, for example, if I had not arrived, what would have happened?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?” “I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?” “I hadn’t time to think.
You came.” “Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?” “I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off.
She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett.
“You will be seen from the road.” Lucy obeyed.
She was in her cousin’s power.
She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started.
Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man!
We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless.
There is Mr.
Eager, but you do not trust him.
Oh, for your brother!
He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse in him a very lion.
Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead.
There are still left some men who can reverence woman.” As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and ranged them upon the pin cushion.
Then she blew into her gloves and said: “It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.” “What train?” “The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?” “At eight.” “Signora Bertolini would be upset.” “We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.” “I expect she will.
However, we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses’ hotel.
Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?” “Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained motionless and silent.
To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome.
Lucy, when admonished, began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte, who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk, vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size.
She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier, the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly.
She knelt down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth.
But she was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not love her, but needed her to love.
For it was in ominous tones that she said, after a long pause: “Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?” Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what forgiving Miss Bartlett meant.
Her emotion relaxed, she modified her embrace a little, and she said: “Charlotte dear, what do you mean?
As if I have anything to forgive!” “You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself, too.
I know well how much I vex you at every turn.” “But no—” Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged martyr.
“Ah, but yes!
I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped.
I might have known it would not do.
You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you.
I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.” “Please—” “My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and were often able to leave me at home.
I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary.
You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.” “You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other, heart and soul.
They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own.
“Failed to make you happy; failed in my duty to your mother.
She has been so generous to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.” “But mother will understand.
It is not your fault, this trouble, and it isn’t a disaster either.” “It is my fault, it is a disaster.
She will never forgive me, and rightly.
For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish?” “Every right.” “When I was here for your sake?
If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you.
Your mother will see this as clearly as I do, when you tell her.” Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said: “Why need mother hear of it?” “But you tell her everything?” “I suppose I do generally.” “I dare not break your confidence.
There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.” The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her.
But in case she should blame you in any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to.
I will never speak of it either to her or to any one.” Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close.
Miss Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background.
George would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually.
At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him; she did not pass judgement.
At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since, it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now, could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent.
She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed, for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity, of her craving for sympathy and love.
Such a wrong is not easily forgotten.
Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff.
And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters.
Before she reached them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle.
Thus it was that, though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers.
She was still dressed.
It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved.
At the critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said: “I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.” Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr. Emerson.” His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true.
It can’t all be true.
I want not to be muddled.
I want to grow older quickly.” Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear.
You need all the rest you can get.” In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO Chapter VIII Medieval The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun.
They were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied.
A poet—none was present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven.
Without was poured a sea of radiance; within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room.
One—a boy of nineteen—was studying a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano.
From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did continually read out to him what she had written.
And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother.
“I tell you I’m getting fairly sick.” “For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication.
“Time they did.” “I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.” “It’s his third go, isn’t it?” “Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.” “I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy.
I don’t know how girls manage things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t have to say it again now.
Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do feel so uncomfortable.” “Do you indeed, dear?
How interesting!” “I feel—never mind.” He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse.
I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.’” “Yes, mother, you told me.
A jolly good letter.” “I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it.
But—’” She stopped reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all.
He has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so forth.
When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.” “Nor me.” “You?” Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?” “He asked me for my permission also.” She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!” “Why so?” asked the son and heir.
“Why shouldn’t my permission be asked?” “What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything?
What ever did you say?” “I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’” “What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come.
There they still are!” “I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.” “Peeping like that!
Can’t I look out of my own window?” But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves.
For a brief space they were silent.
Close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.” He gave a nervous gulp.
“Not content with ‘permission’, which I did give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy.
He practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her?
And he would have an answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.” “I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.” “I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth.
“There!
Fly into a stew!
I can’t help it—had to say it.
I had to say no.
He ought never to have asked me.” “Ridiculous child!” cried his mother.
“You think you’re so holy and truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit.
Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say?
I hope he boxed your ears.
How dare you say no?” “Oh, do keep quiet, mother!
I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes.
I tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed too, and went away, it may be all right.
But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.” “No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the subject, “I shall not keep quiet.
You know all that has passed between them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.” “Not a bit!” he pleaded.
“I only let out I didn’t like him.
I don’t hate him, but I don’t like him.
What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.” He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“I know his mother; he’s good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick the piano!
He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face remained dissatisfied.
She added: “And he has beautiful manners.” “I liked him till just now.
I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not knowing.” “Mr.
Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest.
“I don’t see how Mr. Beebe comes in.” “You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he means.
He said: ‘Mr.
Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I asked him what he meant.
He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking.
Since Cecil has come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.” “You never can, dear.
But I can.
You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.” The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it.
But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust.
Cecil praised one too much for being athletic.
Was that it?
Cecil made one talk in one’s own way.
This tired one.
Was that it?
And Cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow’s cap.
Unaware of his own profundity, Freddy checked himself.
He must be jealous, or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother.
“‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’ I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light.
She keeps that flat abominably—” “Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the country?” “Don’t interrupt so foolishly.
Where was I?
Oh yes—‘Young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing.
I’ll stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out, too?” “Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I have told Lucy so.
But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.
I know that Lucy likes your son, because she tells me everything.
But I do not know—’” “Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation.
He couldn’t bear the Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging down their poles.
Light entered.
There was revealed a terrace, such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little rustic seat, and two flower-beds.
But it was transfigured by the view beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald.
Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described.
He was medieval.
Like a Gothic statue.
Tall and refined, with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision, worshipped as asceticism.
A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe meant.
And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!” “I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals.
They wished that they also knew Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones.
We are obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand at the furniture.
“This is indeed a joyous day!
I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy.” “I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most.
Why could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room; looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat.
She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis.
Then she saw her brother’s face.
Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms.
He said, “Steady on!” “Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it?” Cecil suggested.
“And I’d stop here and tell my mother.” “We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.” They passed into the sunlight.
Cecil watched them cross the terrace, and descend out of sight by the steps.
They would descend—he knew their ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed, until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical.
He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s.
That day she had seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel.
But Italy worked some marvel in her.
It gave her light, and—which he held more precious—it gave her shadow.
Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence.
She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness.
Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other.
It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion.
Her refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase went—she had been exactly the same to him as before.
Three months later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked her again in bald, traditional language.
She reminded him of a Leonardo more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her.
He walked home with her unashamed, feeling not at all like a rejected suitor.
The things that really mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy.
His mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on it, he moved to the writing table.
There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,” followed by many erasures.
He recoiled without reading any more, and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive.
With that outlook it should have been a successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished book-cases, that writing-table.
The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s letter.
He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay in that direction; but he worried about it none the less.
It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their permission.
Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected.
“I represent all that he despises.
Why should he want me for a brother-in-law?” The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible.
“Mr.
Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse.
Do you suppose that I shall get it?” “I should say so.
Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.” “Pfui!” “I know,” said Cecil.
“I know.
I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it.” For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip.
Isn’t this news?” “News?
I don’t understand you,” said Cecil.
“News?” Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field.
He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!” “Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself.
Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen!
Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant?
But his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question!
To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church!
I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.” “I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man languidly.
“I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board.
Perhaps there is no difference, or perhaps those aren’t the right names.
I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery.
It is very remiss of me.
Italy and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on sufferance.” Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert, determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?” “I have no profession,” said Cecil.
“It is another example of my decadence.
My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like.
I know I ought to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.” “You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe.
“It is a wonderful opportunity, the possession of leisure.” His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally.
He felt, as all who have regular occupation must feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve.
I daren’t face the healthy person—for example, Freddy Honeychurch.” “Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?” “Admirable.
The sort who has made England what she is.” Cecil wondered at himself.
Why, on this day of all others, was he so hopelessly contrary?
He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting tea before evening service.” “I suppose Anne never told them you were here.
In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives.
The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the chair-legs with her feet.
The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of Mary, but they are very grave.
Shall we look in the garden?” “I know the faults of Mary.
She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs.” “The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the suet sufficiently small.” They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many.
No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy.
Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.” “She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree.
At present she has none.” “At present?” “I’m not cynical.
I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.
Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully, and live so quietly?
I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both.
The water-tight compartments in her will break down, and music and life will mingle.
Then we shall have her heroically good, heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.” Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?” “Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was not wonderful, and at Florence.
Since I came to Summer Street she has been away.
You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps.
Oh, I forgot; of course, you knew her before.
No, she wasn’t wonderful in Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.” “In what way?” Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next.
There was simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them.
I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string.
Picture number two: the string breaks.” The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he viewed things artistically.
At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?” “No.
I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall.” “It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous, contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst.
He cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken?
What do you mean?” “I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.” The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize.
I had no idea you were intimate with her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down his mouth at the corners.
Was this the reception his action would get from the world?
Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement.
But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly.
“I fear that Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.” “Not that.
But you ought to have stopped me.
I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes.
Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so freely with any one; certainly not with you.” “You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?” Mr. Beebe pulled himself together.
Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions.
He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet.
I foresaw at Florence that her quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended.
I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step.
She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio.
He did not omit to do so.
“She has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her.” “Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden.
“Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?” Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march.
Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried.
He looked at Lucy.
In her presence he could not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but generally I’m too shy.
I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them, grave and gay, great and small.
I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and mother.
And now I want my tea.” “You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted.
“How dare you be serious at Windy Corner?” He took his tone from her.
There was no more heavy beneficence, no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures.
None of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe.
Away from it, in the solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be critical.
But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious.
It has a strange power, for it compels not only the lips, but the very heart.
The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed.
Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel sentimental.
Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party.
If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true.
Anne, putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them greatly.
They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door.
Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family honoured pun on fiance.
Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as a mother-in-law.
As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.
Chapter IX Lucy As a Work of Art A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood, for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him.
People congratulated Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid.
They were gone some time, and Cecil was left with the dowagers.
When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?” “I suppose so.
Mother, would it be?” “Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and said: “To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.” “I am so sorry that you were stranded.” “Not that, but the congratulations.
It is so disgusting, the way an engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment.
All those old women smirking!” “One has to go through it, I suppose.
They won’t notice us so much next time.” “But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong.
An engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and should be treated as such.” Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially correct.
The spirit of the generations had smiled through them, rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth.
To Cecil and Lucy it promised something quite different—personal love.
Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said.
“Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?” “I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public.
The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic.
Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato.” “Inglese Italianato?” “E un diavolo incarnato!
You know the proverb?” She did not.
Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother.
But Cecil, since his engagement, had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me.
There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must accept them.” “We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?” “It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in, or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?” She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert.
“I don’t see any difference.
Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same place.” “We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap.
“This is me.
That’s Windy Corner.
The rest of the pattern is the other people.
Motives are all very well, but the fence comes here.” “We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.” She leant placidly back.
Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and that’s Mr. Beebe.” “A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.” Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect what they meant.
She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried.
“I consider him far above the average.
I only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful ones, is Mr.
Eager, the English chaplain at Florence.
He was truly insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate.
He was a snob, and so conceited, and he did say such unkind things.” “What sort of things?” “There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife.” “Perhaps he had.” “No!” “Why ‘no’?” “He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.” Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing.
Mr.
Eager would never come to the point.
He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.” “Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate should go round spreading slander?
It was, I believe, chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped.
People pretended he was vulgar, but he certainly wasn’t that.” “Poor old man!
What was his name?” “Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr.
Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know.
I hate him.
I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto.
I hate him.
Nothing can hide a petty nature.
I _hate_ him.” “My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“You’ll blow my head off!
Whatever is there to shout over?
I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen.” He smiled.
There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s moral outburst over Mr.
Eager.
It was as if one should see the Leonardo on the ceiling of the Sistine.
He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not in muscular rant.
But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive.
After a moment, he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval.
He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them.
He praised the pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road.
The outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact.
Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I feel I could never live out of it.
When I’m in the country I feel the same about the country.
After all, I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people who live amongst them must be the best.
It’s true that in nine cases out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything.
The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions.
Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town.
Do you feel that, Mrs. Honeychurch?” Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled.
She had not been attending.
Cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either.
Her brow was wrinkled, and she still looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral gymnastics.
It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?” “‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height, What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’ Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?” “Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled spire.
Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church.
In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages.
Some great mansions were at hand, but they were hidden in the trees.
The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement, having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals.
“Albert” was inhabited.
His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells.
His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace.
“Cissie” was to let.
Three notice-boards, belonging to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact.
Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically.
“Summer Street will never be the same again.” As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry.
Now we shall know.
Sir Harry, pull those things down at once!” Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I meant to.
I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss Flack.” “Am I not always right?
She ought to have gone before the contract was signed.
Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s time?” “But what can I do?” He lowered his voice.
“An old lady, so very vulgar, and almost bedridden.” “Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully.
He had had full warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory.
He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt.
Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper.
He ventured to differ, however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration.
Sir Harry hinted that a column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin.
He built his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage.
He had failed in his duties to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy landlord.
But it is such an awkward size.
It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.” Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise Sir Harry for despising them.
The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously.
“It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.” “Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly.
“That is exactly what I fear, Mr. Vyse.
It will attract the wrong type of people.
The train service has improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind.
And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles?” “Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate.
She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea.
How would you like spinsters?” “My dear Lucy, it would be splendid.
Do you know any such?” “Yes; I met them abroad.” “Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.
I heard from them last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan.
I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people.
Mr. Beebe knows them, too.
May I tell them to write to you?” “Indeed you may!” he cried.
“Here we are with the difficulty solved already.
How delightful it is!
Extra facilities—please tell them they shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees.
Oh, the agents!
The appalling people they have sent me!
One woman, when I wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance.
As if one cares about that!
And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable.
And oh, the deceit!
I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week.
The deceit of the most promising people.
My dear Lucy, the deceit!” She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all.
I know the type.
Preserve me from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy.
It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down.” “I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very sad thing.” “The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil.
“I haven’t met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.” “Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.” “It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied.
“I oughtn’t to come with my troubles to young people.
But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no real help.” “Then may I write to my Misses Alan?” “Please!” But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed: “Beware!
They are certain to have canaries.
Sir Harry, beware of canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come.
Beware of women altogether.
Only let to a man.” “Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups.
If they get drunk, there’s an end of them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off.
If they’re vulgar, they somehow keep it to themselves.
It doesn’t spread so.
Give me a man—of course, provided he’s clean.” Sir Harry blushed.
Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex.
Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction.
He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time, should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself.
She was delighted.
Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house.
Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?” “Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them.
He beamed at them knowingly, said, “Aha!
young people, young people!” and then hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!” “I can’t help it.
It would be wrong not to loathe that man.” “He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.” “No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life.
In London he would keep his place.
He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife would give brainless dinner parties.
But down here he acts the little god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and every one—even your mother—is taken in.” “All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt discouraged.
“I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.” “It matters supremely.
Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel!
How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh!
with his bald head and retreating chin!
But let’s forget him.” This Lucy was glad enough to do.
If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape?
For instance, Freddy.
Freddy was neither clever, nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”?
And what would she reply?
Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety enough.
She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps, during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them.
Summer Street lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?” “Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.” “I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon.
“Why is it, Lucy, that you always say the road?
Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?” “Haven’t I?
The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with me in a room.” “A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes.
Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road.
Never in the real country like this.” “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?
I have never felt anything of the sort.
You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.” “I don’t know that you aren’t.
I connect you with a view—a certain type of view.
Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?” She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing: “Do you know that you’re right?
I do.
I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room.
How funny!” To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray?
With no view?” “Yes, with no view, I fancy.
Why not?” “I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the open air.” She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?” As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees.
She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!” “Why do you call it that?” “I can’t remember why.
I suppose it comes out of some book.
It’s only a puddle now, but you see that stream going through it?
Well, a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful.
Then Freddy used to bathe there.
He is very fond of it.” “And you?” He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed here, too, till I was found out.
Then there was a row.” At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of prudishness within him.
But now?
with his momentary cult of the fresh air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity.
He looked at her as she stood by the pool’s edge.
She was got up smart, as she phrased it, and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?” “Charlotte,” she murmured.
“She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.” “Poor girl!” She smiled gravely.
A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!” “Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.” At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him.
“What, Cecil?” “Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me—” He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed.
His courage had gone.
“Yes?” “Up to now I have never kissed you.” She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?” “Of course, you may, Cecil.
You might before.
I can’t run at you, you know.” At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities.
Her reply was inadequate.
She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil.
As he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them.
Such was the embrace.
He considered, with truth, that it had been a failure.
Passion should believe itself irresistible.
It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.
Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.
Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young man behind the counter would have done?
He recast the scene.
Lucy was standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness.
For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation.
He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts.
At last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.” “What name?” “The old man’s.” “What old man?” “That old man I told you about.
The one Mr.
Eager was so unkind to.” He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had.
Chapter X Cecil as a Humourist The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to.
Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up, and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there himself.
Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs.
Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy.
He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility.
“I cannot think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter.
When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.
The best obtainable.
Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags, orange-peel, and broken bottles.
A Radical out and out, she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia.
Life, so far as she troubled to conceive it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and identical foes.
In this circle, one thought, married, and died.
Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills.
But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not particularly high.
You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you.
She returned with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to irritation.
He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad.
He did not realize that Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely.
Nor did he realize a more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her.
A rebel she was, but not of the kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but equality beside the man she loved.
For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.” “But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe.
“I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called, and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably.
They are coming.
I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried.
“Just because they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their ‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing.
And poor Lucy—serve her right—worn to a shadow.” Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court.
Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn.
When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring.
“If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count.
I told you not Saturn.” “Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.” “Saturn doesn’t bounce.” “Saturn bounces enough.” “No, he doesn’t.” “Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.” “Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in.
That’s right, Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over the shins!” Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness.
Up in the house Cecil heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not come down to impart it, in case he got hurt.
He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man.
But he hated the physical violence of the young.
How right it was!
Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.” “That wasn’t the name—” Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.” “Nonsense, Freddy!
You know nothing about it.” “Nonsense yourself!
I’ve this minute seen him.
He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem!
ahem!
I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’ and slapped him on the back.” “Exactly.
The Miss Alans?” “Rather not.
More like Anderson.” “Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed.
“Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right?
I _said_ don’t interfere with Cissie Villa.
I’m always right.
I’m quite uneasy at being always right so often.” “It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s.
Freddy doesn’t even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.” “Yes, I do.
I’ve got it.
Emerson.” “What name?” “Emerson.
I’ll bet you anything you like.” “What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly.
“I wish I had never bothered over it at all.” Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky.
Mr. Beebe, whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy?
Do you know what Emersons they are?” “I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was democratic.
Like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person.
All right, Lucy”—she was sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother’s a snob.
But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s affectation to pretend there isn’t.” “Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways.
Seated on a promontory herself, she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald.
The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man.
Pray, does that satisfy you?” “Oh, yes,” he grumbled.
“And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety.” “_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly.
“Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.” “But has Cecil—” “Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem!
Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’” She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much.
While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry Otway, she had borne it like a good girl.
She might well “screech” when she heard that it came partly from her lover.
Mr. Vyse was a tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people.
The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure.
He diverted it as follows: “The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean?
No, I don’t suppose it will prove to be them.
It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse’s.
Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people!
The queerest people!
For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets.
They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa.
Poor little ladies!
So shocked and so pleased.
It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories.
‘My dear sister loves flowers,’ it began.
They found the whole room a mass of blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult.
Yes, I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets.” “Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his sister’s face was very red.
She could not recover herself.
Mr. Beebe saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very immature—pessimism, et cetera.
Our special joy was the father—such a sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.” In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip, but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble.
He repeated any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Lucy, don’t desert us—go on playing bumble-puppy.
Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place.
That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being there.
Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop?
By-the-by, we really must ask Charlotte here some time.” Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer.
He suggested that his hostess was mistaken.
At the hint of opposition she warmed.
She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told.
The name escaped her.
What was the name?
Oh, what was the name?
She clasped her knees for the name.
Something in Thackeray.
She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely.
“Don’t be silly.
You always overdo it when you play.” As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right.
Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of nondescript tourists.
Hitherto truth had come to her naturally.
She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely truthful?
Well, at all events, she must not tell lies.
She hurried up the garden, still flushed with shame.
A word from Cecil would soothe her, she was sure.
“Cecil!” “Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window.
He seemed in high spirits.
“I was hoping you’d come.
I heard you all bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here.
I, even I, have won a great victory for the Comic Muse.
George Meredith’s right—the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa.
Don’t be angry!
Don’t be angry!
You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.” He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said.
“Freddy has told us.
Naughty Cecil!
I suppose I must forgive you.
Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have nice friends of yours.
But you oughtn’t to tease one so.” “Friends of mine?” he laughed.
“But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was.
“Do you know where I met these desirable tenants?
In the National Gallery, when I was up to see my mother last week.” “What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously.
“I don’t quite understand.” “In the Umbrian Room.
Absolute strangers.
They were admiring Luca Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly.
However, we got talking, and they refreshed me not a little.
They had been to Italy.” “But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends.
I thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—” “Cecil!
No, it’s not fair.
I’ve probably met them before—” He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair.
Anything is fair that punishes a snob.
That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good.
Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with me.
There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things.
I believe in democracy—” “No, you don’t,” she snapped.
“You don’t know what the word means.” He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque.
“No, you don’t!” Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil.
I blame you—I blame you very much indeed.
You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look ridiculous.
You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that it is all at my expense?
I consider it most disloyal of you.” She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness.
As long as Lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not minded.
He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally.
He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who was silent.
In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse.
His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch.
Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement, met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned.
The Miss Alans were duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held responsible for the failure.
Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived.
Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood.
And Cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood.
Therefore Cecil was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood.
But, as I say, this took a little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done.
She was glad that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative.
He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in Lucy.
At last she longed for attention, as a woman should, and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do!
I don’t know what I should do without you.” Several days passed.
Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett.
A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not corresponded since they parted in August.
The coolness dated from what Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased amazingly.
For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical.
Charlotte, unselfish in the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue their tour.
Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs.
Vyse was an acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly.
Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows.
It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS, “_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA, “I have news of you at last!
Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome.
Puncturing her tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out.
He said his father had just taken the house.
He _said_ he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (?).
He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea.
Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who will forbid him to enter the house, etc.
That was a great misfortune, and I dare say you have told them already.
Mr. Vyse is so sensitive.
I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome.
I am very sorry about it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me, “Your anxious and loving cousin, “CHARLOTTE.” Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows: “BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE, “Many thanks for your warning.
When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she would blame you for not being always with me.
I have kept that promise, and cannot possibly tell her now.
I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself.
She should have tried at the Rectory.
I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage.
You must see that it would be too absurd.
If the Emersons heard I had complained of them, they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they are not.
I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for myself.
They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the other day.
We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy Corner at all, but here.
Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your envelope again.
No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately, “L.
M. HONEYCHURCH.” Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not.
Were Lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at?
Miss Bartlett suggested the former.
Perhaps she was right.
It had become a great thing now.
Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago.
She tried to tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school.
But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on.
It did her no harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors.
The weather was cool, and it did her no harm.
In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people.
The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl.
One was tired of everything, it seemed.
One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter.
In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann.
“Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the querulous beauty of the music had died.
She shook her head and played Schumann again.
The melody rose, unprofitably magical.
It broke; it was resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave.
The sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of the audience throb.
Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr. Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s, had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among many people.
The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.” “Her music always was wonderful.” “Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent Honeychurches, but you know what I mean.
She is not always quoting servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.” “Italy has done it.” “Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her.
“It is just possible.
Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.” “But her music!” he exclaimed.
“The style of her!
How she kept to Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.
Schumann was right for this evening.
Schumann was the thing.
Do you know, mother, I shall have our children educated just like Lucy.
Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and then—not till then—let them come to London.
I don’t believe in these London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.” “Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s room.
Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought it kind to go herself.
She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.” “Bad dreams?” “Just dreams.” The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You should have heard us talking about you, dear.
He admires you more than ever.
Dream of that.” Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand.
Mrs. Vyse recessed to bed.
Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII Twelfth Chapter It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed.
As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines.
Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over his Rectory gate.
Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.” “M’m.” “They might amuse you.” Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe.
“They are worth it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa.
“Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!” “I’ve brought someone to see you.” “I’ll be down in a minute.” The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs.
Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty.
The sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered.
“Are they that sort?” “I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment.
What have they got?
Byron.
Exactly.
A Shropshire Lad.
Never heard of it.
The Way of All Flesh.
Never heard of it.
Gibbon.
Hullo!
dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on.
Well, I suppose your generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.” “Mr.
Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.” “I know.
Isn’t it jolly?
I like that.
I’m certain that’s the old man’s doing.” “How very odd of him!” “Surely you agree?” But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.” “The same as Lucy’s got.” “Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?” “She came back yesterday.” “I suppose she had a good time?” “Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book.
“She and Cecil are thicker than ever.” “That’s good hearing.” “I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.” Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different now, mother thinks.
She will read all kinds of books.” “So will you.” “Only medical books.
Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed.
Cecil says—” “What on earth are those people doing upstairs?
Emerson—we think we’ll come another time.” George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.” Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth.
Perhaps he was shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face wanted washing.
At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe.” “Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do?
how d’ye do?
Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard.
But I’m afraid it will only act between men.
Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How do you do?
Come and have a bathe’?
And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal.” “I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly descending the stairs.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.
I tell you they shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.” “We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you place in the past, is really yet to come.
We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies.” Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead.
We despise the body less than women do.
But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden.” “I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once.
But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her?
To-day, I believe that we must discover Nature.
After many conquests we shall attain simplicity.
It is our heritage.” “Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at Florence.” “How do you do?
Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George for a bathe.
Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty.
I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr. Vyse, too.
He has been most kind.
He met us by chance in the National Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house.
Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway.
I have met so few Liberal landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude.
Ah, this wind!
You do well to bathe.
Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!” “Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy.
“I must—that is to say, I have to—have the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.” “_Call_, my lad?
Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle?
Call on your grandmother!
Listen to the wind among the pines!
Yours is a glorious country.” Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr.
Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed.
I trust that you have realized about the ten days’ interval.
It does not count that I helped you with the stair-eyes yesterday.
It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon.” “Yes, go and bathe, George.
Why do you dawdle talking?
Bring them back to tea.
Bring back some milk, cakes, honey.
The change will do you good.
George has been working very hard at his office.
I can’t believe he’s well.” George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him.
“It is only a pond, don’t you know.
I dare say you are used to something better.” “Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.” Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods.
How glorious it was!
For a little time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy.
It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees.
Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word.
He spoke of Florence.
George attended gravely, assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse!
Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?” “I did not.
Miss Lavish told me.” “When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of Coincidence.’” No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we suppose.
For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here now, when one comes to reflect.” To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is.
I have reflected.
It is Fate.
Everything is Fate.
We are flung together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart.
The twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—” “You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman.
“Let me give you a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate.
Don’t say, ‘I didn’t do this,’ for you did it, ten to one.
Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?” “Italy.” “And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch?” “National Gallery.” “Looking at Italian art.
There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate.
You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our friends.
This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.” “It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George.
“But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy.” Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject.
But he was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is still to write.” Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that you have come.” Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond.
I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles.
There lay the pond, set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky.
On account of the rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe.
“No apologies are necessary for the pond.” George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid?
I love willow-herb in seed.
What’s the name of this aromatic plant?” No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines.
Very charming, very charming.” “Mr.
Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George.
Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds.
It was necessary to use his muscles.
It was necessary to keep clean.
Mr. Beebe watched them, and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful, water’s simply ripping.” “Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful.
Mr. Beebe, do.” “Apooshoo, kouf.” Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked around him.
He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against the blue.
How glorious it was!
The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably.
Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad.
The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in Götterdämmerung.
But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and Botany and Fate.
They began to play.
Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each other.
A little deferentially, they splashed George.
He was quiet: they feared they had offended him.
Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a second time.
Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get clean.
And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward, proclaiming: “No.
We are what matters.
Without us shall no enterprise begin.
To us shall all flesh turn in the end.” “A try!
A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a kick.
“Goal!” “Goal!” “Pass!” “Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat!
No, that’s enough, Freddy.
Dress now.
No, I say!” But the two young men were delirious.
Away they twinkled into the trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in his own parish.
Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean.
“Hi!
Steady on!
I see people coming you fellows!” Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi!
hi!
_Ladies!_” Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined.
Still, they did not hear Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch, Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some bracken.
George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Whoever were those unfortunate people?
Oh, dears, look away!
And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?” “Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he knew not against what.
He led them now towards the bracken where Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
Was that his waistcoat we left in the path?
Cecil, Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—” No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol and evidently “minded.” “I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.” “This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.” They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds.
“I can’t be trodden on, can I?” “Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you!
What miserable management!
Why not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?” “Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and if another fellow—” “Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to argue.
Come, Lucy.” They turned.
“Oh, look—don’t look!
Oh, poor Mr. Beebe!
How unfortunate again—” For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken.
“I’ve swallowed a pollywog.
It wriggleth in my tummy.
I shall die—Emerson you beast, you’ve got on my bags.” “Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain shocked.
“And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first.
All these colds come of not drying thoroughly.” “Mother, do come away,” said Lucy.
“Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.” “Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed.
Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and personable against the shadowy woods, he called: “Hullo, Miss Honeychurch!
Hullo!” “Bow, Lucy; better bow.
Whoever is it?
I shall bow.” Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away.
On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory.
It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for youth.
Chapter XIII How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview!
But she had always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which surely we have a right to assume.
Who could foretell that she and George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth?
She had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent.
She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life.
A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much.
“I will bow,” she had thought.
“I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom?
To gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls!
She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil.
It was another of those dreadful engagement calls.
Mrs. Butterworth had wanted to see him, and he did not want to be seen.
He did not want to hear about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside.
He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done.
Lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace.
No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock.
Miss Bartlett, indeed, though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory.
Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter with Cecil?” The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.” “Perhaps he’s tired.” Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.” “I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.” “Cecil has told you to think so.
You were devoted to her as a little girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever.
No—it is just the same thing everywhere.” “Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?” “Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?” “Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing trouble ahead.
“It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes him sometimes seem—” “Oh, rubbish!
If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother!
I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!” “Not in that way.
At times I could wring her neck.
But not in that way.
No.
It is the same with Cecil all over.” “By-the-by—I never told you.
I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London.” This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs. Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to contradict me.
No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture; your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly remember.” “I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to.
But he does not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.” “Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?” “You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do.” “Then why didn’t he leave the room?
Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone’s pleasure?” “We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy.
Something had enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form.
The two civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes.
Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made things no better.
There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to be supercilious, and he had succeeded.
And Lucy—she knew not why—wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.” “All right, mother—” “Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop.
Go.” She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window.
It faced north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky.
Now, as in the winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes.
One connected the landing window with depression.
No definite problem menaced her, but she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly.
And she ought not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter.
She must be more careful; her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.” “My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been!
You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public.
It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else.
Do be more careful.
You forget the place is growing half suburban.” “I say, is anything on to-morrow week?” “Not that I know of.” “Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.” “Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this muddle.” “What’s wrong with the court?
They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve ordered new balls.” “I meant _it’s_ better not.
I really mean it.” He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage.
She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with temper.
Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans.
Then Mrs. Honeychurch opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making!
I have something to say to you.
Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes.
I really can’t stop.
I must dress too.” “How’s Charlotte?” “All right.” “Lucy!” The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?” “Her _what?_” “Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?” “I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly.
“I shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.” Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out.
She did not.
She said: “Come here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And, though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life.
It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil.
Cecil despised their methods—perhaps rightly.
At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven.
Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to.
Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding.
Then Freddy said: “Lucy, what’s Emerson like?” “I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?” “Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.” “He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly.
I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.” “Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter.” “One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie.
“Among other things, that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.” “Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.” “She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily.
The remark was a happy one, for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females.
She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety by print.
Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,” with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s wrath.
But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness.
There were too many ghosts about.
The original ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr.
Harris, Miss Bartlett’s letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes.
It was Miss Bartlett who returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s.
How is she?” “I tore the thing up.” “Didn’t she say how she was?
How does she sound?
Cheerful?” “Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.” “Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler.
I know myself how water preys upon one’s mind.
I would rather anything else—even a misfortune with the meat.” Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish.
I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long.” It was more than her nerves could stand.
And she could not protest violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded.
“It’s impossible.
We can’t have Charlotte on the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is.
Freddy’s got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare.
It simply can’t be done.” “Nonsense!
It can.” “If Minnie sleeps in the bath.
Not otherwise.” “Minnie can sleep with you.” “I won’t have her.” “Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.” “Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy.
“I don’t want to make difficulties, but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.” Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.” “No, I don’t.
And no more does Cecil.
She gets on our nerves.
You haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be, though so good.
So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but spoil us by not asking her to come.” “Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of you two.
You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers.
You are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like to grow old.” Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike,” put in Freddy.
“She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right.” “I know, dear.
She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return.” But Lucy hardened her heart.
It was no good being kind to Miss Bartlett.
She had tried herself too often and too recently.
One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss Bartlett nor any one else upon earth.
She was reduced to saying: “I can’t help it, mother.
I don’t like Charlotte.
I admit it’s horrid of me.” “From your own account, you told her as much.” “Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly.
She flurried—” The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping the places she had known as a child.
The Sacred Lake would never be the same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy Corner.
How would she fight against ghosts?
For a moment the visible world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I don’t care for eggs.
I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.” Cecil frowned again.
Oh, these Honeychurches!
Eggs, boilers, hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact.
“May me and Lucy get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.” Chapter XIV How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely Of course Miss Bartlett accepted.
And, equally of course, she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior spare room—something with no view, anything.
Her love to Lucy.
And, equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only faced the situation that encompassed her.
She never gazed inwards.
If at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to nerves.
When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset her nerves.
Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might upset her nerves.
She was nervous at night.
When she talked to George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved her deeply, and she wished to remain near him.
How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him!
Of course, the wish was due to nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us.
Once she had suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious.
Life is easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire.
She loved Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough.
Standing between Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy, and George had replied.
She was anxious to show that she was not shy, and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his crudities in time.
I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully.” Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits.
He laughs more.” “Yes,” replied the clergyman.
“He is waking up.” That was all.
But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and she entertained an image that had physical beauty.
In spite of the clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs. Honeychurch drove to meet her.
She arrived at the London and Brighton station, and had to hire a cab up.
No one was at home except Freddy and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour.
Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
“I have upset everything.
Bursting in on young people!
But I insist on paying for my cab up.
Grant that, at any rate.” “Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.” “I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather.
Five shillings, and I gave a bob to the driver.” Miss Bartlett looked in her purse.
Only sovereigns and pennies.
Could any one give her change?
Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns.
Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But who am I to give the sovereign to?” “Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me.
We all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt settling of accounts.” Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid.
A solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance, and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me wretched.
I should practically be robbing the one who lost.” “Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil.
“So it will work out right if you give the pound to me.” “Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously.
“How is that, Mr. Vyse?” “Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab.
Give me the pound, and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.” Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy.
He was playing at nonsense among his peers.
Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles.
In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction.
“I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid.” “Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.” “But I don’t see—” They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you.
I’m done.
I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me.
Miss Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me.
Ow!
What about Mr. Floyd’s ten shillings?
Ow!
No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.” “I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening.
“Thank you, dear, for reminding me.
A shilling was it?
Can any one give me change for half a crown?” “I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign.
No, give me up that sovereign.
I’ll get Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the beginning.” “Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed her across the lawn.
Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity.
When they were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?” “No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant.
“Let me see—a sovereign’s worth of silver.” She escaped into the kitchen.
Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were too uncanny.
It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t.
Here is your money—all shillings, except two half-crowns.
Would you count it?
You can settle your debt nicely now.” Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source.” “Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle.
“George Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?” Miss Bartlett considered.
“For instance, the driver.
I saw him looking through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.” Lucy shuddered a little.
“We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we aren’t careful.
How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of Cecil?” “We must think of every possibility.” “Oh, it’s all right.” “Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows.
In fact, he is certain to know.” “I don’t care if he does.
I was grateful to you for your letter, but even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it.” “To contradict it?” “No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best.
Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young.
Ladies are certainly different.” “Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully.
“You kind, anxious thing.
What _would_ you have me do?
First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and then you say, ‘Tell’.
Which is it to be?
Quick!” Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest.
I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am.
You will never forgive me.” “Shall we go out, then.
They will smash all the china if we don’t.” For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again.
Have you seen the young one yet?” “Yes, I have.” “What happened?” “We met at the Rectory.” “What line is he taking up?” “No line.
He talked about Italy, like any other person.
It is really all right.
What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it bluntly?
I do wish I could make you see it my way.
He really won’t be any nuisance, Charlotte.” “Once a cad, always a cad.
That is my poor opinion.” Lucy paused.
“Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a novel.
It was a new one from Smith’s library.
Her mother must have returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head.
I fell into all those violets, and he was silly and surprised.
I don’t think we ought to blame him very much.
It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly.
It really does; it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw.
Freddy rather likes him, and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself.
He has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into tears.
He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big railways—not a porter!
and runs down to his father for week-ends.
Papa was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired.
There!
Now for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm.
“Suppose we don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more.
We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.” Lucy thought this rather a good speech.
The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it.
Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people.
She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess.
Explanations took place, and in the midst of them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain.
Chapter XV The Disaster Within The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most of the days of that year.
In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold.
Up on the heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves unchangeable.
Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path.
From the house came incoherent sounds, as of females preparing for worship.
“The men say they won’t go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her, no nonsense”—“Anne!
Mary!
Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine.
Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan; on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously.
The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and movement may engender shadow.
But this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window.
Her new cerise dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan.
At her throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an engagement ring.
Her eyes are bent to the Weald.
She frowns a little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry.
In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills.
“Lucy!
Lucy!
What’s that book?
Who’s been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil?” “It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.” “But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.” Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a Loggia.
She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up.
It was dreadful how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it.
Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and Cecil had said, “What!
you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?” She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for.
I do beg, no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence.
Where is the child?
Minnie!
That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!)
Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late.
Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse, never the carriage.
“Where’s Charlotte?
Run up and hurry her.
Why is she so long?
She had nothing to do.
She never brings anything but blouses.
Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses!
Minnie!” Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting.
As usual, she didn’t see why.
Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men?
The young men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words.
Mrs. Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but sovereigns and half crowns.
Could any one give me—” “Yes, easily.
Jump in.
Gracious me, how smart you look!
What a lovely frock!
You put us all to shame.” “If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully.
She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse.
The necessary roar ensued, and then they drove off.
“Good-bye!
Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering.
On the subject of “church and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation.
He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to overhaul herself; she did not know it was done.
Honest orthodoxy Cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that might grow heavenward like flowers.
All that he said on this subject pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church.
There was a line of carriages down the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa.
To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother.
“Unless the young man considers that he knows me already.” He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally.
Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how glad he was that she was going to be married.
She said yes, she was glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice; she had never known him offended before.
He added: “We find, though, that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing.
I am very much upset about it.” “I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,” said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further.
“He thought we should be artistic.
He is disappointed.” “And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up.
What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly.
She must avoid censuring Cecil.
For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned, though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says.
He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall.
Yet it does seem so unkind.” “There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“That’s exactly what I say.
Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?” “There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain amount of light,” he continued in measured tones.
“We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.
Choose a place where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!” “Eh—?” “I see you’re going to be clever.
I hope you didn’t go behaving like that to poor Freddy.” George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said.
“He behaved that way to me.
It is his philosophy.
Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first.” “What _do_ you mean?
No, never mind what you mean.
Don’t explain.
He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon.
Do you play tennis?
Do you mind tennis on Sunday—?” “George mind tennis on Sunday!
George, after his education, distinguish between Sunday—” “Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday.
No more do I. That’s settled.
Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased.” He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans.” “I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck.
The kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the morning sun?
She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.” “Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady.
Miss Bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow.
It was the pension Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow.
Like any boy, he blushed and was ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered.
He said: “I—I’ll come up to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house.
Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and need help.
To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them.
“George has been in such good spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.” Lucy caught her cousin’s eye.
Something in its mute appeal made her reckless.
“Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven.
Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy.
All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things.
It was not an exploit.
He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her hand to her cheek.
“He does not love me.
No.
How terrible if he did!
But he has not told.
He will not tell.” She longed to shout the words: “It is all right.
It’s a secret between us two for ever.
Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room.
The secret, big or little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world.
Thus she interpreted her joy.
She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so safe.
As he helped her out of the carriage, she said: “The Emersons have been so nice.
George Emerson has improved enormously.” “How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them, and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth.
For the only relationship which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected.
He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are.
George Emerson is coming up this afternoon.
He is a most interesting man to talk to.
Only don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks.
Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal.
Generally Lucy was depressed at meals.
Some one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will not last, this cheerfulness.
In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee.
Her mother would always sit there, her brother here.
The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning, would never be hidden behind the western hills.
After luncheon they asked her to play.
She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland.
Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.” She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round.
There George was.
He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without a word of greeting, she reopened the piano.
Cecil should have the Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson.
Lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do.
She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano.
“I vote you have a men’s four.” “All right.” “Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil.
“I will not spoil the set.” He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil.
I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s Emerson.” George corrected him: “I am not bad.” One looked down one’s nose at this.
“Then certainly I won’t play,” said Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse.
You had much better not play.
Much better not.” Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she would play.
“I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?” But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall back on Lucy.
There is no other way out of it.
Lucy, go and change your frock.” Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature.
She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon.
As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner.
She liked music, but how much better tennis seemed.
How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms.
Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child.
George served, and surprised her by his anxiety to win.
She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
The hills stood out above its radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara.
She might be forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her.
He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood, and would not sympathize with exaltation.
He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others.
He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.” “Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke.
When they had finished their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and really everyone must listen to it.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.” “What fun, Cecil!
Read away.
Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are you tired?” “Of course I’m not!” “Do you mind being beaten?” She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a splendid player, though.
The light was behind you, and it was in my eyes.” “I never said I was.” “Why, you did!” “You didn’t attend.” “You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house.
We all exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.” “‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset.
Leonora was speeding—’” Lucy interrupted.
“Leonora?
Is Leonora the heroine?
Who’s the book by?” “Joseph Emery Prank.
‘Sunset.
Leonora speeding across the square.
Pray the saints she might not arrive too late.
Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it now—’” Lucy burst into laughter.
“‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed!
Why it’s Miss Lavish!
It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under somebody else’s name.” “Who may Miss Lavish be?” “Oh, a dreadful person—Mr.
Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?” Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up.
“Of course I do.
I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street.
It was she who told me that you lived here.” “Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean something else.
She watched his head, which was almost resting against her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening.
“No wonder the novel’s bad,” she added.
“I never liked Miss Lavish.
But I suppose one ought to read it as one’s met her.” “All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature.
“Every one writes for money in these days.” “Oh, Cecil—!” “It is so.
I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow.
The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her.
She had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his.
Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black head again.
She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?” “I never notice much difference in views.” “What do you mean?” “Because they’re all alike.
Because all that matters in them is distance and air.” “H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it.” “I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural, for the same reason.” Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up.
Something gets added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those hills.” He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured.
“I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again.
I’m so sorry he’s not so well.” “No, he isn’t well.” “There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil.
“Also that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who remember them, even in small rooms.” “Mr.
Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?” “None.
Why?” “You spoke of ‘us.’” “My mother, I was meaning.” Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!” “I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.” “I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead.
It is the first thing that I remember.” Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after tennis—he didn’t do.
He would have strolled away if Lucy had not stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.” “Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.” “No—read away.
I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read out loud.
If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.” This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him.
It put their visitor in the position of a prig.
Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr.
Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book.
Cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked.
But her attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning.
“Find me chapter two, if it isn’t bothering you.” Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.” She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.” He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone.
Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village.
The season was spring.’” Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose, for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read.
He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence, while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets.
All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’” Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use.
No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the lack of it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’” “This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last.
She thought a disaster was averted.
But when they entered the shrubbery it came.
The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI Lying to George But Lucy had developed since the spring.
That is to say, she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove.
Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by deep sobs.
She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I must write some letters,” and went up to her room.
Then she prepared for action.
Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty.
Perhaps there never is such a contest.
It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first aim was to defeat herself.
As her brain clouded over, as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves.
She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been.
Remembering that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him.
The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man not only from others, but from his own soul.
In a few moments Lucy was equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin arrived.
“Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?” Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at heart.
“There is a scene in it.
The hero and heroine make love.
Do you know about that?” “Dear—?” “Do you know about it, please?” she repeated.
“They are on a hillside, and Florence is in the distance.” “My good Lucia, I am all at sea.
I know nothing about it whatever.” “There are violets.
I cannot believe it is a coincidence.
Charlotte, Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her?
I have thought before speaking; it _must_ be you.” “Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.” Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved.
“Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t put that in her book?” Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it.
Yes.” “Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” “So you did tell?” “I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of conversation—” “But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell mother?” “I will never forgive Eleanor.
She has betrayed my confidence.” “Why did you tell her, though?
This is a most serious thing.” Why does any one tell anything?
The question is eternal, and it was not surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response.
She had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again.
Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh!
Is it possible that men are such brutes?
Behind Cecil’s back as we were walking up the garden.” Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now?
Can you tell me?” “Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day.
Fancy if your prospects—” “I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word.
“I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.” It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince.
“However,” said the girl, despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done.
You have put me in a most awkward position.
How am I to get out of it?” Miss Bartlett could not think.
The days of her energy were over.
She was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that.
She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him?
I can’t tell mother now—owing to you.
Nor Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you.
I am caught up every way.
I think I shall go mad.
I have no one to help me.
That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.” Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing.
What’s to be _done?_ We women go maundering on.
What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?” “I always said he was a cad, dear.
Give me credit for that, at all events.
From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a bath.” “Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong!
We’ve both made a muddle of it.
George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he to be left unpunished, or isn’t he?
I want to know.” Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless.
Her own exposure had unnerved her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain.
She moved feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?” “Willingly would I move heaven and earth—” “I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously.
“Will you speak to him?
It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all happened because you broke your word.” “Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.” Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.” “It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture.
“No one will help me.
I will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below.
“Found the lost ball?
Good man!
Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you!
I admire you—” They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul.
Her anger faded at the sight of him.
Ah!
The Emersons were fine people in their way.
She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying: “Freddy has taken him into the dining-room.
The others are going down the garden.
Come.
Let us get this over quickly.
Come.
I want you in the room, of course.” “Lucy, do you mind doing it?” “How can you ask such a ridiculous question?” “Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand.
“I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded.
She remembered their last evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss Bartlett’s toque on the door.
She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time.
Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying.
“The jam’s jolly good.” George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the dining-room.
As she entered he stopped, and said: “No—nothing to eat.” “You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants.
Where’s mother?” “She’s started on her Sunday writing.
She’s in the drawing-room.” “That’s all right.
You go away.” He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table.
Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech.
She just said: “I can’t have it, Mr. Emerson.
I cannot even talk to you.
Go out of this house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door.
“I hate a row.
Go please.” “What—” “No discussion.” “But I can’t—” She shook her head.
“Go, please.
I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.” “You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t mean that you are going to marry that man?” The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her.
“You are merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse.
He’s only for an acquaintance.
He is for society and cultivated talk.
He should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.” It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?” “I can scarcely discuss—” “No, but have you ever?
He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now.
It’s shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person.
I would never have let myself go.
But I saw him first in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters.
Then he brings us here, and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour.
That is the man all over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he can find.
Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to settle whether you were shocked or no.
Cecil all over again.
He daren’t let a woman decide.
He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand years.
Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly; and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the whole of this afternoon.
Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’ because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more self-control.
I’m not ashamed.
I don’t apologize.
But it has frightened you, and you may not have noticed that I love you.
Or would you have told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly?
But therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.” Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson.
Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit.” And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality.
He said: “Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary.
“I’m the same kind of brute at bottom.
This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep, and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden.
But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He thought.
“Yes—really in a better way.
I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards her.
“Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain.
I have cared for you since that man died.
I cannot live without you, ‘No good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun.
As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered.
I called.
I wanted to live and have my chance of joy.” “And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm.
“Does he not matter?
That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly?
A detail of no importance, I suppose?” But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?” He said: “It is our last chance.
I shall do all that I can.” And as if he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening.
“You wouldn’t stop us this second time if you understood,” he said.
“I have been into the dark, and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.” Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though demolishing some invisible obstacle.
She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go.
“It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really.
It is that love and youth matter intellectually.” In silence the two women watched him.
His last remark, they knew, was nonsense, but was he going after it or not?
Would not he, the cad, the charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish?
No.
He was apparently content.
He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house.
Their tongues were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!” Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet.
“Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the latter.
One more fuss through with you, Charlotte.
Many thanks.
I think, though, that this is the last.
My admirer will hardly trouble me again.” And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish: “Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is it?
Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really.
It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.” “Let’s go down to them.” But, once in the open air, she paused.
Some emotion—pity, terror, love, but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring.
That something or other mattered intellectually?
A leaf, violently agitated, danced past her, while other leaves lay motionless.
That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy!
There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll hurry.” “Mr.
Emerson has had to go.” “What a nuisance!
That spoils the four.
I say, Cecil, do play, do, there’s a good chap.
It’s Floyd’s last day.
Do play tennis with us, just this once.” Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete.
As you well remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not inflict myself on you.” The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes.
How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her engagement.
Chapter XVII Lying to Cecil He was bewildered.
He had nothing to say.
He was not even angry, but stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men.
Freddy and Mr. Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things over.
We are too different.
I must ask you to release me, and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.” It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—” “I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued, still on her knees by the sideboard.
“My Italian trip came too late, and I am forgetting all that I learnt there.
I shall never be able to talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.” “I don’t understand you.
You aren’t like yourself.
You’re tired, Lucy.” “Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once.
“That is exactly like you.
You always think women don’t mean what they say.” “Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.” “What if I do?
It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth.
I can’t marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.” “You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches.
But give me a moment’s time.” He closed his eyes.
“You must excuse me if I say stupid things, but my brain has gone to pieces.
Part of it lives three minutes back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.” It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation increased.
She again desired a struggle, not a discussion.
To bring on the crisis, she said: “There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them.
Things must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.” “I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never could play.
I don’t understand a word you say.” “You can play well enough to make up a four.
I thought it abominably selfish of you.” “No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis.
Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you have warned me if you felt anything wrong?
You talked of our wedding at lunch—at least, you let me talk.” “I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly.
“I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations.
Of course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks.
Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain.” She developed this position.
“Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted to be my husband?
I don’t think so.
You don’t like Freddy, nor my mother.
There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point.
They have to-day.
I see clearly.
I must speak.
That’s all.” “I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently.
“I cannot tell why, but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not treating me fairly.
It’s all too horrible.” “What’s the good of a scene?” “No good.
But surely I have a right to hear a little more.” He put down his glass and opened the window.
From where she knelt, jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy or any one might be outside.” He obeyed.
“I really think we had better go to bed, if you don’t mind.
I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards.
As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good talking.” But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment more desirable.
He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first time since they were engaged.
From a Leonardo she had become a living woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even eluded art.
His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved me!” “I did not,” she said.
“I thought I did at first.
I am sorry, and ought to have refused you this last time, too.” He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour.
She had counted on his being petty.
It would have made things easier for her.
By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently.
I dare say you are right not to.
But it would hurt a little less if I knew why.” “Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort who can’t know any one intimately.” A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that.
But you will question me, though I beg you not to, and I must say something.
It is that, more or less.
When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always protecting me.” Her voice swelled.
“I won’t be protected.
I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right.
To shield me is an insult.
Can’t I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you?
A woman’s place!
You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me.
I won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me.
That’s why I break off my engagement.
You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause.
Then Cecil said with great emotion: “It is true.” “True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word.
It is a revelation.
It is—I.” “Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.” He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true.
I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged.
I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother.
You are even greater than I thought.” She withdrew a step.
“I’m not going to worry you.
You are far too good to me.
I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve.
I have never known you till this evening.
I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be.
But this evening you are a different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—” “What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance.
She cried: “If you think I am in love with some one else, you are very much mistaken.” “Of course I don’t think that.
You are not that kind, Lucy.” “Oh, yes, you do think it.
It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men.
If a girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting, brutal!
As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.” He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past.
I shall never say it again.
You have taught me better.” She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no ‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity.
I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was.
I only meant that there was a force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.” “All right, Cecil, that will do.
Don’t apologize to me.
It was my mistake.” “It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals, and yours are the nobler.
I was bound up in the old vicious notions, and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke.
“I must actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really am.
Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman.
Will you shake hands?” “Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the curtains.
“Good-night, Cecil.
Good-bye.
That’s all right.
I’m sorry about it.
Thank you very much for your gentleness.” “Let me light your candle, shall I?” They went into the hall.
“Thank you.
Good-night again.
God bless you, Lucy!” “Good-bye, Cecil.” She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings.
On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry.
In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself.
She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel.
She gave up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by catch-words.
The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk.
But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within.
They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue.
As the years pass, they are censured.
Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.
They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one.
The night received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill.
On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy Corner,—he laughed.
The situation was so glorious, the house so commonplace, not to say impertinent.
The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road.
So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly.
Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation.
One might laugh at the house, but one never shuddered.
Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip.
He had heard from the Miss Alans.
These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed their plans.
They were going to Greece instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter.
Of course, Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train.
But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.” Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe greeted Windy Corner was partly for her.
She would see the fun of it, and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty.
Though she was hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or she could not play the piano as she did.
He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been understood.
This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been illustrated by facts.
Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road.
Therefore it must be the horse, who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe recognized as Cecil and Freddy.
They were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs.
Cecil, who wore a bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the station.
They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it.
“Isn’t it wonderful?
Isn’t it romance?
Most certainly they will go to Constantinople.
They are taken in a snare that cannot fail.
They will end by going round the world.” Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious!
I never notice it in you young people; you do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing.
‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’ So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn!
No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans.
They want the Pension Keats.” “I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you any matches?” “I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?” “Never.” “Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit.
I haven’t been to Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my friends going.
It is altogether too big for our little lot.
Don’t you think so?
Italy is just about as much as we can manage.
Italy is heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus.
All right, Freddy—I am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men.
“I was saying, if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be Italian.
Big enough in all conscience.
The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me.
There the contrast is just as much as I can realize.
But not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here comes the victoria.” “You’re quite right,” said Cecil.
“Greece is not for our little lot”; and he got in.
Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really.
And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box, which had not been returned.
As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you only talked about books.
Cecil’s hard hit.
Lucy won’t marry him.
If you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken down.” “But when—” “Late last night.
I must go.” “Perhaps they won’t want me down there.” “No—go on.
Good-bye.” “Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart.
The house was again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata.
He hesitated a moment, but went down the garden as requested.
There he found a mournful company.
It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of assistance.
At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe?
Gracious what a mess everything is!
Look at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.” Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch.
The garden-child, who did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her.
“You have worried them as much as they can stand.
Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly.
I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.” “Oh, must you?
Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it.” Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about for, either in the house or out of it.” Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance.
As they walked up the garden, the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother.
Or will she come with us?” “I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.” “They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has gone, and Freddy won’t play with me.
In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.” “Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur.
“Go and put on your boots.” He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart.
She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do?
Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive.
Would you come too?” “I don’t think I will, thank you.” “No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.” Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!” “Yes.” “I met them on the hill.
Your brother told me.” “Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed.
Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.” “Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you have done the right thing.” “So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.” “I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.” “So does mother.
Mother minds dreadfully.” “I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute.
It was really a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.” “Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he?
I gathered that he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.” “Boys are so odd.” Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor.
Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel.
Mr. Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action, so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan.
That was really what brought me over.
I thought it might amuse you all.” “How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter.
After a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with “Going abroad?
When do they start?” “Next week, I gather.” “Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?” “No, he didn’t.” “Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.” So she did want to talk about her broken engagement.
Always complaisant, he put the letter away.
But she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans!
How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad!” “I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast!” She laughed heartily.
“Oh, delightful!
I wish they’d take me.” “Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel?
Perhaps George Emerson is right.
He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’” “Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople.
I have always longed to go to Constantinople.
Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?” Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm.
She had always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed.
He saw, to his surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends, after Cissie Villa.” “Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would give anything to go with them.” “Would your mother spare you again so soon?
You have scarcely been home three months.” “She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement.
“I simply _must_ go away.
I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
“Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away?
I didn’t realize at the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.” “You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—” “Yes, yes.
I knew you’d understand.” Mr. Beebe did not quite understand.
Why could not Miss Honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family?
Cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line, and was not going to annoy her.
Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying.
He hinted this to her, and she accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down.” “I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all.
Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so masterful.
I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way.
He would improve me in places where I can’t be improved.
Cecil won’t let a woman decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t.
What nonsense I do talk!
But that is the kind of thing.” “It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you.
I do sympathize and agree most profoundly.
I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?” “But I must go somewhere!” she cried.
“I have been worrying all the morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with clenched fists, and repeated: “I must!
And the time I shall have with mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring.
You all think much too highly of me.
I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased.
“I must get away, ever so far.
I must know my own mind and where I want to go.” “Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out of the front-door.
He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource.
She is evidently much worried, as, of course, she ought to be.
I know all about it.
The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak.” Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett.
As he had put it to himself at Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable.
He assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with her.
Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter drop.” “I wonder.” “It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street.
It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal at the present moment.” Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows.
Death is a strong word—surely too strong.
There was no question of tragedy.
He said: “Of course, Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she chooses.
Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.” “I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly.
“Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you.
One cannot be too careful.” “Quite so.” “I do implore absolute secrecy.
A chance word to a chattering friend, and—” “Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words.
A rector lives in a web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he will regard them.
He will change the subject, as did Mr. Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately?
I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish.
It is odd how we of that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one another’s lives.
Two, three, four, six of us—no, eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch.
We must really give the Signora a testimonial.” And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern.
On the summit they paused.
The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue.
Summer was retreating.
The wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven.
The weather was breaking up, breaking, broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery.
Mr. Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: “We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.” They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock.
That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably.
Mr. Beebe saw that Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces.
They would hand the child her food through the window.
Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past.
I know little and care less about that; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit.
She has acted loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her.
But the future.
Seriously, what do you think of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again.
“I don’t know whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career.
It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.” Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.” To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you.
In it I spy Lucy’s salvation.” “Really.
Now, why?” “She wanted to leave Windy Corner.” “I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to say—selfish.” “It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire a change.” Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect misses.
Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced.
Perhaps she must have a change.
I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand these things.
But why need she go as far as Greece?” “You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner.
“Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?)
Why not Tunbridge Wells?
Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning.
I cannot help her.
I will say no more.
Perhaps I have already said too much.
I am not to talk.
I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.” Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance.
I know too well that I get on Lucy’s nerves.
Our tour was a failure.
She wanted to leave Florence, and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.” “Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe.
“I want your advice.” “Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to him, though familiar to Lucy.
“I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?” Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd woman really did know.
“She must not stop here a moment, and we must keep quiet till she goes.
I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already.
Only, Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone.
If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—” “Otherwise—?” “Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.” Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude.
The tavern sign—a beehive trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him.
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another man” that would have attracted a grosser mind.
He only felt that Miss Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form.
Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry.
His belief in celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower.
“They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure.
In the case of Lucy, the feeling was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity.
The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement.
Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the action of others.
The compact that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey.
He conversed on indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants; Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could literature influence life?
Windy Corner glimmered.
In the garden, Mrs. Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly.
“This comes of putting off.
We might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece.
I don’t know what the world’s coming to.” “Mrs.
Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must.
Come up to the house and let’s talk it over.
Do you, in the first place, mind her breaking with Vyse?” “Mr.
Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.” “So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good.
Now come up to the house.” They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone.
It was expensive and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed.
Nor would Charlotte have succeeded.
The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right.
It must be something I can’t understand.
Lucy!
Let’s tell her.
Lucy!” “She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said.
He opened the door, and heard the words of a song: “Look not thou on beauty’s charming.” “I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.” “Sit thou still when kings are arming, Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——” “It’s a song that Cecil gave her.
How odd girls are!” “What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly.
She went into the drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.” Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a bit.” “And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you.” “Oh, splendid!
Oh, thank you!” Mr. Beebe followed.
Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys.
She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness.
Her mother bent over her.
Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful.
Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_, in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and therefore ignored by the art of to-day.
Why should Lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens, Speak not when the people listens,” she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.” “Mr.
Beebe knows my rude ways.” “It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he.
“Go on.” “It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly.
“I forget why—harmony or something.” “I suspected it was unscholarly.
It’s so beautiful.” “The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten.
Why throw up the sponge?” “How stupidly you talk!” said his sister.
The _Santa Conversazione_ was broken up.
After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.” “Stop thine ear against the singer—” “Wait a minute; she is finishing.” “From the red gold keep thy finger; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” “I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear.
She had behaved splendidly, and he had helped her.
He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl’s life.
If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—” Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly.
He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned: “Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die.” However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX Lying to Mr. Emerson The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial England.
They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books, mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them, for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores.
Miss Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one’s face in the train.
Lucy promised, a little depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.
A gentleman is such a stand-by.” Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine continued.
“It is not every young man who would be so unselfish.
But perhaps he will come out and join you later on.” “Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off.
I do so long to see him.” “No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch.
“She doesn’t like it.” “No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really?
How funny!
I should have thought that in this case—” “Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going?
It is such a pleasure to have met you!” They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right.
We just got through that time.” But her mother was annoyed.
“I should be told, dear, that I am unsympathetic.
But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it.
There all the time we had to sit fencing, and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is most unpleasant.” Lucy had plenty to say in reply.
She described the Miss Alans’ character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?” “Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then.
It’s much pleasanter.
How wet it is!
Let’s turn in here.” “Here” was the British Museum.
Mrs. Honeychurch refused.
If they must take shelter, let it be in a shop.
Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then.
Let’s go to Mudie’s.
I’ll buy a guide-book.” “You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this hole-and-corner work.
You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute.
But why not announce it?
Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?” “It’s only for a few days.” “But why at all?” Lucy was silent.
She was drifting away from her mother.
It was quite easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the incidental advantage of being true.
But she could not say it.
She disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors—Light.
Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent.
She was thinking, “My daughter won’t answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me.
Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.” This was perfectly true.
Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no longer.
It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain.
She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very instruments of life.
She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk!
Of course I’m not tired of Windy Corner.” “Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?” She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.” “Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?” “Hush, mother!
People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s.
She bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home; but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been.
You see, I come into my money next year.” Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed “eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear.
“I’ve seen the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy.
I have seen so little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket like to-day, but to stop.
I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl.” “And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police.
And call it a Mission—when no one wants you!
And call it Duty—when it means that you can’t stand your own home!
And call it Work—when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is!
And then to prepare yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.” “I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we have not got it.
She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys.
But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well.
Take your independence and be gone.
Rush up and down and round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.” Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.” “Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed.
“How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!” “_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid pain.
“More every moment.” “I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike.” “Well, I see the likeness.
The same eternal worrying, the same taking back of words.
You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters.” “What rubbish!
And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you asked her to stop.
I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you not to, but of course it was not listened to.” “There you go.” “I beg your pardon?” “Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.” Lucy clenched her teeth.
“My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked Charlotte to stop.
I wish you would keep to the point.” And the conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train, little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station.
It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy.
Leaning forward, she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful.
“The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she remarked.
For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street, where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on Mr. Beebe’s old mother.
“We shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining.
Oh, for a little air!” Then she listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That melody was blurred by the soft road.
“_Can’t_ we have the hood down?” she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well, old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs. Honeychurch’s neck.
But now that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?” “It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?” “Yes, miss, they have gone.” Lucy sank back.
The carriage stopped at the Rectory.
She got out to call for Miss Bartlett.
So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary.
Waste!
That word seemed to sum up the whole of life.
Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded her mother.
Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible.
Other people had.
When the maid opened the door, she was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a great favour: might she go to church?
Mr. Beebe and his mother had already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily.
“I forgot it was Friday.
Let’s all go.
Powell can go round to the stables.” “Lucy dearest—” “No church for me, thank you.” A sigh, and they departed.
The church was invisible, but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour.
This was a stained window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation.
Even their church, built upon the slope of the hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study?
There was only that one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait, sir.” Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips.
George she had faced, and could have faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry!
George is so sorry!
He thought he had a right to try.
I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he had told me first.
He ought not to have tried.
I knew nothing about it at all.” If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand.
“But you must not scold him.” Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love.
I said: ‘When love comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind.
No.
Passion is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my day is over, and though there is the result.
Poor boy!
He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that whatever you felt you did not mean.
Yet”—his voice gathered strength: he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?” Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries.
Holding it up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son.” “But you do remember it?” “He has misbehaved himself from the first.” “I only was told that he loved you last Sunday.
I never could judge behaviour.
I—I—suppose he has.” Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to him.
His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said.
“I am glad he is sorry.
Do you know what he did?” “Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction.
“He only tried when he should not have tried.
You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are going to marry the man you love.
Do not go out of George’s life saying he is abominable.” “No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong.
I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all.
My mother and my cousin have gone.
I shall not be so very late—” “Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?” “Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.” “As his mother did.” “But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr.
Emerson_—what are you talking about?” “When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round.
She thought it a judgement.” He shuddered.
“Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents.
Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in again!
A judgement!
And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church!
Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch?
Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever?” “I don’t know,” gasped Lucy.
“I don’t understand this sort of thing.
I was not meant to understand it.” “But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his principles.
I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was well she was ill.
He made her think about sin, and she went under thinking about it.” It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man.
“I did hold firm.” And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what cost!—he had won a victory over them.
“My boy shall go back to the earth untouched.” She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill. “Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present.
“George last Sunday—no, not ill: just gone under.
He is never ill.
But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful, and he will not think it worth while to live.
It was always touch and go.
He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live.
He will never think anything worth while.
You remember that church at Florence?” Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible.
Then we took the house here, and he goes bathing with your brother, and became better.
You saw him bathing?” “I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair.
I am deeply sorry about it.” “Then there came something about a novel.
I didn’t follow it at all; I had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old.
Ah, well, one must have failures.
George comes down to-morrow, and takes me up to his London rooms.
He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be where he is.” “Mr.
Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my account.
I am going to Greece.
Don’t leave your comfortable house.” It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled.
“How good everyone is!
And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning and heard I was going!
Here I am so comfortable with a fire.” “Yes, but you won’t go back to London.
It’s absurd.” “I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he can’t.
He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.” “Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t.
I’ve been bother enough to the world by now.
I can’t have you moving out of your house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my account.
You must stop!
I am just going to Greece.” “All the way to Greece?” Her manner altered.
“To Greece?” “So you must stop.
You won’t talk about this business, I know.
I can trust you both.” “Certainly you can.
We either have you in our lives, or leave you to the life that you have chosen.” “I shouldn’t want—” “I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George?
No, it was wrong of George to try.
We have pushed our beliefs too far.
I fancy that we deserve sorrow.” She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological blue.
They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling.
To Lucy who could not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still.
I think I will sit in the carriage.” “Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.” “Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you.
And what were you saying about going abroad?” She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but you were to be married this year, I thought.” “Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands.
Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you.
I hope—it isn’t because George spoke that you are both going?” “No.” “I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.” “Thank you.” At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church.
His cassock was covered with rain.
“That’s all right,” he said kindly.
“I counted on you two keeping each other company.
It’s pouring again.
The entire congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it.
Did Powell go round?” “I think so; I’ll see.” “No—of course, I’ll see.
How are the Miss Alans?” “Very well, thank you.” “Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?” “I—I did.” “Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the two Miss Alans?
Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm.
I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely.
“I made a slip.
Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England.” Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man.
To George, to Cecil, she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was not her companion to Greece.
And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving him?
You are leaving the man you love?” “I—I had to.” “Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?” Terror came over her, and she lied again.
She made the long, convincing speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more.
He heard her in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you.
It seems to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.” She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the world.
It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so dreadful.
It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the things that I might have avoided.
We can help one another but little.
I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware of muddle.
Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be annoyed with me and weren’t?
Do you remember before, when you refused the room with the view?
Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent.
“Don’t trust me, Miss Honeychurch.
Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was still silent.
“‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’ I think he puts it well.
Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean.
You love George!” And after his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction.
“You love the boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other word expresses it.
You won’t marry the other man for his sake.” “How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man.” “But you are.” She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you.
It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way.
You must marry, or your life will be wasted.
You have gone too far to retreat.
I have no time for the tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that really matter, and _for which_ you marry.
I know that, with George, you will find them, and that you love him.
Then be his wife.
He is already part of you.
Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part.
You will wish that it was.
You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.
I know by experience that the poets are right: love is eternal.” Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon, her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the body.
Ah!
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that!
Ah!
for a little directness to liberate the soul!
Your soul, dear Lucy!
I hate the word now, because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round.
But we have souls.
I cannot say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you ruining yours.
I cannot bear it.
It is again the darkness creeping in; it is hell.” Then he checked himself.
“What nonsense I have talked—how abstract and remote!
And I have made you cry!
Dear girl, forgive my prosiness; marry my boy.
When I think what life is, and how seldom love is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the world was made.” She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote.
Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—” “You’ve frightened me,” she moaned.
“Cecil—Mr.
Beebe—the ticket’s bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair.
“I’m caught in the tangle.
I must suffer and grow old away from him.
I cannot break the whole of life for his sake.
They trusted me.” A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only.
Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—” “No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—” “But why should they, when you have deceived them?” Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.” “You’re not worthy of their trust.” “What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?” “One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson.
To whom do you refer?
Trust whom?” “I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George.
They have loved one another all along.” Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl.
He was very quiet, and his white face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman.
A long black column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?” “Mr.
Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—” “Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!” “It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly.
“It’s the part of people that you don’t understand.” Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy!
Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr.
Beebe, could you help me?” He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am more grieved than I can possibly express.
It is lamentable, lamentable—incredible.” “What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me.
Marry George, Miss Honeychurch.
He will do admirably.” He walked out and left them.
They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair.
But his face revived her.
It was the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark.
Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know.
But remember the mountains over Florence and the view.
Ah, dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever right to despise.
George still dark, all the tussle and the misery without a word from him.
Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.” “You kiss me,” said the girl.
“You kiss me.
I will try.” He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his salutation remained.
He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he managed to strengthen her.
It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once.” Chapter XX The End of the Middle Ages The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves.
They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf.
They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity.
Trembling, anxious, cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople, they did go round the world.
The rest of us must be contented with a fair, but a less arduous, goal.
Italiam petimus: we return to the Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had your father’s room.
I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.” He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.” “Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was trying to mend, and gazed out through the window.
It was evening and again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully.
“What can such people be made of?” “Same stuff as parsons are made of.” “Nonsense!” “Quite right.
It is nonsense.” “Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.” “Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and advancing his face to hers.
“What’s there to cry at?
Kiss me here.” He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all.
When it came to the point, it was she who remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who knew whose room this had been last year.
It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.” “Now kiss me here; then here.” Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window, opened it (as the English will), and leant out.
There was the parapet, there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills.
The cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago.
A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool.
He had helped himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its name is, still shows.” “San Miniato.
I’ll just finish your sock.” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils, the Miss Bartletts!
Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?” “Not yet.” His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?” “Silly boy!
He thinks he’s being dignified.
He knew we should go off in the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands.
They had fair warning, and now he calls it an elopement.
Ridiculous boy—” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” “But it will all come right in the end.
He has to build us both up from the beginning again.
I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women.
He has, for the second time, quite altered.
Why will men have theories about women?
I haven’t any about men.
I wish, too, that Mr. Beebe—” “You may well wish that.” “He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us again.
I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner.
I wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run.” “Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only thing I did do—and you came back to me.
So possibly you know.” He turned back into the room.
“Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to the window, so that she, too, saw all the view.
They sank upon their knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one another’s names.
Ah!
it was worth while; it was the great joy that they had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—” “Oh, bother that man!” But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte.
How cruel she would be to a man like that!” “Look at the lights going over the bridge.” “But this room reminds me of Charlotte.
How horrible to grow old in Charlotte’s way!
To think that evening at the rectory that she shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house.
For she would have stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense.
You couldn’t have made me.
When I am very happy”—she kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs.
If Charlotte had only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone to silly Greece, and become different for ever.” “But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely.
He said so.” “Oh, no, she didn’t see him.
She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe, don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church.
She said so.” George was obstinate again.
“My father,” said he, “saw her, and I prefer his word.
He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett.
A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up.
He didn’t speak to her.” Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other’s arms.
It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting.
George, who disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew.
Then, why did she risk the meeting?
She knew he was there, and yet she went to church.” They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind.
She rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?” “Mean what?” “Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—” Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.” “Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.” “Niente.” The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?” He whispered: “Is it this?
Is this possible?
I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped.
That from the very first moment we met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of course, very far down.
That she fought us on the surface, and yet she hoped.
I can’t explain her any other way.
Can you?
Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable.
The sight of us haunted her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend.
There are details—it burnt.
I read the book afterwards.
She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through.
She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy.
We can never make friends with her or thank her.
But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.” “It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.” Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited, love attained.
But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this.
The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean.
