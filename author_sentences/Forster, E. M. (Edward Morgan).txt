the end of the middle ages     part one     chapter i the bertolini   the signora had no business to do it said miss bartlett no business at all
she promised us south rooms with a view close together instead of which here are north rooms looking into a courtyard and a long way apart
oh lucy  and a cockney besides said lucy who had been further saddened by the signoras unexpected accent
it might be london she looked at the two rows of english people who were sitting at the table at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the english people at the portraits of the late queen and the late poet laureate that hung behind the english people heavily framed at the notice of the english church rev
cuthbert eager m a
oxon
 that was the only other decoration of the wall
charlotte dont you feel too that we might be in london
i can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside
i suppose it is ones being so tired  this meat has surely been used for soup said miss bartlett laying down her fork
i want so to see the arno
the rooms the signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the arno
the signora had no business to do it at all
oh it is a shame  any nook does for me miss bartlett continued but it does seem hard that you shouldnt have a view  lucy felt that she had been selfish
charlotte you mustnt spoil me of course you must look over the arno too
i meant that
the first vacant room in the front you must have it said miss bartlett part of whose travelling expenses were paid by lucys mothera piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion
no no
you must have it  i insist on it
your mother would never forgive me lucy  she would never forgive me  the ladies voices grew animated andif the sad truth be owneda little peevish
they were tired and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled
some of their neighbours interchanged glances and one of themone of the illbred people whom one does meet abroadleant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument
he said  i have a view i have a view  miss bartlett was startled
generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking and often did not find out that they would do till they had gone
she knew that the intruder was illbred even before she glanced at him
he was an old man of heavy build with a fair shaven face and large eyes
there was something childish in those eyes though it was not the childishness of senility
what exactly it was miss bartlett did not stop to consider for her glance passed on to his clothes
these did not attract her
he was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim
so she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her and then said a view
oh a view
how delightful a view is  this is my son said the old man his names george
he has a view too  ah said miss bartlett repressing lucy who was about to speak
what i mean he continued is that you can have our rooms and well have yours
well change  the better class of tourist was shocked at this and sympathized with the newcomers
miss bartlett in reply opened her mouth as little as possible and said thank you very much indeed that is out of the question  why said the old man with both fists on the table
because it is quite out of the question thank you  you see we dont like to take began lucy
her cousin again repressed her
but why he persisted
women like looking at a view men dont and he thumped with his fists like a naughty child and turned to his son saying george persuade them  its so obvious they should have the rooms said the son
theres nothing else to say  he did not look at the ladies as he spoke but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful
lucy too was perplexed but she saw that they were in for what is known as quite a scene and she had an odd feeling that whenever these illbred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt not with rooms and views but withwell with something quite different whose existence she had not realized before
now the old man attacked miss bartlett almost violently why should she not change
what possible objection had she
they would clear out in half an hour
miss bartlett though skilled in the delicacies of conversation was powerless in the presence of brutality
it was impossible to snub any one so gross
her face reddened with displeasure
she looked around as much as to say are you all like this and two little old ladies who were sitting further up the table with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs looked back clearly indicating we are not we are genteel  eat your dinner dear she said to lucy and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured
lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite
eat your dinner dear
this pension is a failure
tomorrow we will make a change  hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it
the curtains at the end of the room parted and revealed a clergyman stout but attractive who hurried forward to take his place at the table cheerfully apologizing for his lateness
lucy who had not yet acquired decency at once rose to her feet exclaiming oh oh
why its mr beebe
oh how perfectly lovely
oh charlotte we must stop now however bad the rooms are
oh  miss bartlett said with more restraint  how do you do mr beebe
i expect that you have forgotten us miss bartlett and miss honeychurch who were at tunbridge wells when you helped the vicar of st peters that very cold easter  the clergyman who had the air of one on a holiday did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him
but he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by lucy
i am so glad to see you said the girl who was in a state of spiritual starvation and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it
just fancy how small the world is
summer street too makes it so specially funny  miss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street said miss bartlett filling up the gap and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living  yes i heard from mother so last week
she didnt know that i knew you at tunbridge wells but i wrote back at once and i said mr
beebe is  quite right said the clergyman
i move into the rectory at summer street next june
i am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood  oh how glad i am
the name of our house is windy corner mr beebe bowed
there is mother and me generally and my brother though its not often we get him to ch the church is rather far off i mean  lucy dearest let mr beebe eat his dinner  i am eating it thank you and enjoying it  he preferred to talk to lucy whose playing he remembered rather than to miss bartlett who probably remembered his sermons
he asked the girl whether she knew florence well and was informed at some length that she had never been there before
it is delightful to advise a newcomer and he was first in the field
dont neglect the country round his advice concluded
the first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole and round by settignano or something of that sort  no cried a voice from the top of the table
mr
beebe you are wrong
the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato  that lady looks so clever whispered miss bartlett to her cousin
we are in luck  and indeed a perfect torrent of information burst on them
people told them what to see when to see it how to stop the electric trams how to get rid of the beggars how much to give for a vellum blotter how much the place would grow upon them
the pension bertolini had decided almost enthusiastically that they would do
whichever way they looked kind ladies smiled and shouted at them
and above all rose the voice of the clever lady crying prato
they must go to prato
that place is too sweetly squalid for words
i love it i revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability as you know  the young man named george glanced at the clever lady and then returned moodily to his plate
obviously he and his father did not do
lucy in the midst of her success found time to wish they did
it gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold and when she rose to go she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow
the father did not see it the son acknowledged it not by another bow but by raising his eyebrows and smiling he seemed to be smiling across something
she hastened after her cousin who had already disappeared through the curtainscurtains which smote one in the face and seemed heavy with more than cloth
beyond them stood the unreliable signora bowing goodevening to her guests and supported by enery her little boy and victorier her daughter
it made a curious little scene this attempt of the cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the south
and even more curious was the drawingroom which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a bloomsbury boardinghouse
was this really italy
miss bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed armchair which had the colour and the contours of a tomato
she was talking to mr beebe and as she spoke her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards slowly regularly as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle
we are most grateful to you she was saying
the first evening means so much
when you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart dheure  he expressed his regret
do you by any chance know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner  emerson  is he a friend of yours  we are friendlyas one is in pensions  then i will say no more  he pressed her very slightly and she said more
i am as it were she concluded the chaperon of my young cousin lucy and it would be a serious thing if i put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing
his manner was somewhat unfortunate
i hope i acted for the best  you acted very naturally said he
he seemed thoughtful and after a few moments added all the same i dont think much harm would have come of accepting  no harm of course
but we could not be under an obligation  he is rather a peculiar man again he hesitated and then said gently i think he would not take advantage of your acceptance nor expect you to show gratitude
he has the meritif it is oneof saying exactly what he means
he has rooms he does not value and he thinks you would value them
he no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite
it is so difficultat least i find it difficultto understand people who speak the truth  lucy was pleased and said i was hoping that he was nice i do so always hope that people will be nice  i think he is nice and tiresome
i differ from him on almost every point of any importance and so i expecti may say i hopeyou will differ
but his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores
when he first came here he not unnaturally put peoples backs up
he has no tact and no mannersi dont mean by that that he has bad mannersand he will not keep his opinions to himself
we nearly complained about him to our depressing signora but i am glad to say we thought better of it  am i to conclude said miss bartlett that he is a socialist  mr beebe accepted the convenient word not without a slight twitching of the lips
and presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist too  i hardly know george for he hasnt learnt to talk yet
he seems a nice creature and i think he has brains
of course he has all his fathers mannerisms and it is quite possible that he too may be a socialist  oh you relieve me said miss bartlett
so you think i ought to have accepted their offer
you feel i have been narrowminded and suspicious  not at all he answered i never suggested that  but ought i not to apologize at all events for my apparent rudeness  he replied with some irritation that it would be quite unnecessary and got up from his seat to go to the smokingroom
was i a bore said miss bartlett as soon as he had disappeared
why didnt you talk lucy
he prefers young people im sure
i do hope i havent monopolized him
i hoped you would have him all the evening as well as all dinnertime  he is nice exclaimed lucy
just what i remember
he seems to see good in everyone
no one would take him for a clergyman  my dear lucia  well you know what i mean
and you know how clergymen generally laugh mr beebe laughs just like an ordinary man  funny girl
how you do remind me of your mother
i wonder if she will approve of mr beebe  im sure she will and so will freddy  i think everyone at windy corner will approve it is the fashionable world
i am used to tunbridge wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times  yes said lucy despondently
there was a haze of disapproval in the air but whether the disapproval was of herself or of mr beebe or of the fashionable world at windy corner or of the narrow world at tunbridge wells she could not determine
she tried to locate it but as usual she blundered
miss bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one and added i am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion  and the girl again thought i must have been selfish or unkind i must be more careful
it is so dreadful for charlotte being poor  fortunately one of the little old ladies who for some time had been smiling very benignly now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where mr beebe had sat
permission granted she began to chatter gently about italy the plunge it had been to come there the gratifying success of the plunge the improvement in her sisters health the necessity of closing the bedroom windows at night and of thoroughly emptying the waterbottles in the morning
she handled her subjects agreeably and they were perhaps more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon guelfs and ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room
it was a real catastrophe not a mere episode that evening of hers at venice when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea though one better than something else
but here you are as safe as in england
signora bertolini is so english  yet our rooms smell said poor lucy
we dread going to bed  ah then you look into the court she sighed
if only mr emerson was more tactful
we were so sorry for you at dinner  i think he was meaning to be kind  undoubtedly he was said miss bartlett
mr
beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature
of course i was holding back on my cousins account  of course said the little old lady and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl
lucy tried to look demure but could not help feeling a great fool
no one was careful with her at home or at all events she had not noticed it
about old mr emersoni hardly know
no he is not tactful yet have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate and yet at the same timebeautiful  beautiful said miss bartlett puzzled at the word
are not beauty and delicacy the same  so one would have thought said the other helplessly
but things are so difficult i sometimes think  she proceeded no further into things for mr beebe reappeared looking extremely pleasant
miss bartlett he cried its all right about the rooms
im so glad
mr emerson was talking about it in the smokingroom and knowing what i did i encouraged him to make the offer again
he has let me come and ask you
he would be so pleased  oh charlotte cried lucy to her cousin we must have the rooms now
the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be  miss bartlett was silent
i fear said mr beebe after a pause that i have been officious
i must apologize for my interference  gravely displeased he turned to go
not till then did miss bartlett reply my own wishes dearest lucy are unimportant in comparison with yours
it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at florence when i am only here through your kindness
if you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms i will do it
would you then mr beebe kindly tell mr emerson that i accept his kind offer and then conduct him to me in order that i may thank him personally  she raised her voice as she spoke it was heard all over the drawingroom and silenced the guelfs and the ghibellines
the clergyman inwardly cursing the female sex bowed and departed with her message
remember lucy i alone am implicated in this
i do not wish the acceptance to come from you
grant me that at all events  mr beebe was back saying rather nervously  mr
emerson is engaged but here is his son instead  the young man gazed down on the three ladies who felt seated on the floor so low were their chairs
my father he said is in his bath so you cannot thank him personally
but any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out  miss bartlett was unequal to the bath
all her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first
young mr emerson scored a notable triumph to the delight of mr beebe and to the secret delight of lucy
poor young man said miss bartlett as soon as he had gone
how angry he is with his father about the rooms
it is all he can do to keep polite  in half an hour or so your rooms will be ready said mr beebe
then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins he retired to his own rooms to write up his philosophic diary
oh dear breathed the little old lady and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment
gentlemen sometimes do not realize her voice faded away but miss bartlett seemed to understand and a conversation developed in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part
lucy not realizing either was reduced to literature
taking up baedekers handbook to northern italy she committed to memory the most important dates of florentine history
for she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow
thus the halfhour crept profitably away and at last miss bartlett rose with a sigh and said  i think one might venture now
no lucy do not stir
i will superintend the move  how you do do everything said lucy
naturally dear
it is my affair  but i would like to help you  no dear  charlottes energy
and her unselfishness
she had been thus all her life but really on this italian tour she was surpassing herself
so lucy felt or strove to feel
and yetthere was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful
at all events she entered her own room without any feeling of joy
i want to explain said miss bartlett why it is that i have taken the largest room
naturally of course i should have given it to you but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man and i was sure your mother would not like it  lucy was bewildered
if you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him
i am a woman of the world in my small way and i know where things lead to
however mr beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this  mother wouldnt mind im sure said lucy but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues
miss bartlett only sighed and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her goodnight
it gave lucy the sensation of a fog and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in the arno and the cypresses of san miniato and the foothills of the apennines black against the rising moon
miss bartlett in her room fastened the windowshutters and locked the door and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances
it was then that she saw pinned up over the washstand a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation
nothing more
what does it mean she thought and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle
meaningless at first it gradually became menacing obnoxious portentous with evil
she was seized with an impulse to destroy it but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so since it must be the property of young mr emerson
so she unpinned it carefully and put it between two pieces of blottingpaper to keep it clean for him
then she completed her inspection of the room sighed heavily according to her habit and went to bed
chapter ii in santa croce with no baedeker   it was pleasant to wake up in florence to open the eyes upon a bright bare room with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons
it was pleasant too to fling wide the windows pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite and close below the arno gurgling against the embankment of the road
over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore and on the river was a boat also diligently employed for some mysterious end
an electric tram came rushing underneath the window
no one was inside it except one tourist but its platforms were overflowing with italians who preferred to stand
children tried to hang on behind and the conductor with no malice spat in their faces to make them let go
then soldiers appearedgoodlooking undersized menwearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur and a greatcoat which had been cut for some larger soldier
beside them walked officers looking foolish and fierce and before them went little boys turning somersaults in time with the band
the tramcar became entangled in their ranks and moved on painfully like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants
one of the little boys fell down and some white bullocks came out of an archway
indeed if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling buttonhooks the road might never have got clear
over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away and the traveller who has gone to italy to study the tactile values of giotto or the corruption of the papacy may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it
so it was as well that miss bartlett should tap and come in and having commented on lucys leaving the door unlocked and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed should urge her to hasten herself or the best of the day would be gone
by the time lucy was ready her cousin had done her breakfast and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs
a conversation then ensued on not unfamiliar lines
miss bartlett was after all a wee bit tired and thought they had better spend the morning settling in unless lucy would at all like to go out
lucy would rather like to go out as it was her first day in florence but of course she could go alone
miss bartlett could not allow this
of course she would accompany lucy everywhere
oh certainly not lucy would stop with her cousin
oh no
that would never do
oh yes
at this point the clever lady broke in
if it is mrs grundy who is troubling you i do assure you that you can neglect the good person
being english miss honeychurch will be perfectly safe
italians understand
a dear friend of mine contessa baroncelli has two daughters and when she cannot send a maid to school with them she lets them go in sailorhats instead
every one takes them for english you see especially if their hair is strained tightly behind  miss bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of contessa baroncellis daughters
she was determined to take lucy herself her head not being so very bad
the clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in santa croce and if lucy would come too she would be delighted
i will take you by a dear dirty back way miss honeychurch and if you bring me luck we shall have an adventure  lucy said that this was most kind and at once opened the baedeker to see where santa croce was
tut tut
miss lucy
i hope we shall soon emancipate you from baedeker
he does but touch the surface of things
as to the true italyhe does not even dream of it
the true italy is only to be found by patient observation  this sounded very interesting and lucy hurried over her breakfast and started with her new friend in high spirits
italy was coming at last
the cockney signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream
miss lavishfor that was the clever ladys nameturned to the right along the sunny lung arno
how delightfully warm
but a wind down the side streets cut like a knife didnt it
ponte alle grazieparticularly interesting mentioned by dante
san miniatobeautiful as well as interesting the crucifix that kissed a murderermiss honeychurch would remember the story
the men on the river were fishing
untrue but then so is most information
then miss lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks and she stopped and she cried  a smell
a true florentine smell
every city let me teach you has its own smell  is it a very nice smell said lucy who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt
one doesnt come to italy for niceness was the retort one comes for life
buon giorno
buon giorno bowing right and left
look at that adorable winecart
how the driver stares at us dear simple soul  so miss lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of florence short fidgety and playful as a kitten though without a kittens grace
it was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful and a blue military cloak such as an italian officer wears only increased the sense of festivity
buon giorno
take the word of an old woman miss lucy you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors
that is the true democracy
though i am a real radical as well
there now youre shocked  indeed im not exclaimed lucy
we are radicals too out and out
my father always voted for mr gladstone until he was so dreadful about ireland  i see i see
and now you have gone over to the enemy  oh please
if my father was alive i am sure he would vote radical again now that ireland is all right
and as it is the glass over our front door was broken last election and freddy is sure it was the tories but mother says nonsense a tramp  shameful
a manufacturing district i suppose  noin the surrey hills
about five miles from dorking looking over the weald  miss lavish seemed interested and slackened her trot
what a delightful part i know it so well
it is full of the very nicest people
do you know sir harry otwaya radical if ever there was  very well indeed  and old mrs butterworth the philanthropist  why she rents a field of us
how funny  miss lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky and murmured oh you have property in surrey  hardly any said lucy fearful of being thought a snob
only thirty acresjust the garden all downhill and some fields  miss lavish was not disgusted and said it was just the size of her aunts suffolk estate
italy receded
they tried to remember the last name of lady louisa someone who had taken a house near summer street the other year but she had not liked it which was odd of her
and just as miss lavish had got the name she broke off and exclaimed  bless us
bless us and save us
weve lost the way  certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching santa croce the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window
but miss lavish had said so much about knowing her florence by heart that lucy had followed her with no misgivings
lost
lost
my dear miss lucy during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning
how those horrid conservatives would jeer at us
what are we to do
two lone females in an unknown town
now this is what i call an adventure  lucy who wanted to see santa croce suggested as a possible solution that they should ask the way there
oh but that is the word of a craven
and no you are not not not to look at your baedeker
give it to me i shant let you carry it
we will simply drift  accordingly they drifted through a series of those greybrown streets neither commodious nor picturesque in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds
lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of lady louisa and became discontented herself
for one ravishing moment italy appeared
she stood in the square of the annunziata and saw in the living terracotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale
there they stood with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven
lucy thought she had never seen anything more beautiful but miss lavish with a shriek of dismay dragged her forward declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile
the hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins or rather ceases to tell and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop because it looked so typical
it tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped partly of hair oil partly of the great unknown
but it gave them strength to drift into another piazza large and dusty on the farther side of which rose a blackandwhite faade of surpassing ugliness
miss lavish spoke to it dramatically
it was santa croce
the adventure was over
stop a minute let those two people go on or i shall have to speak to them
i do detest conventional intercourse
nasty
they are going into the church too
oh the britisher abroad  we sat opposite them at dinner last night
they have given us their rooms
they were so very kind  look at their figures laughed miss lavish
they walk through my italy like a pair of cows
its very naughty of me but i would like to set an examination paper at dover and turn back every tourist who couldnt pass it  what would you ask us  miss lavish laid her hand pleasantly on lucys arm as if to suggest that she at all events would get full marks
in this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church and were about to enter it when miss lavish stopped squeaked flung up her arms and cried  there goes my localcolour box
i must have a word with him  and in a moment she was away over the piazza her military cloak flapping in the wind nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers and nipped him playfully upon the arm
lucy waited for nearly ten minutes
then she began to get tired
the beggars worried her the dust blew in her eyes and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places
she descended slowly into the piazza with the intention of rejoining miss lavish who was really almost too original
but at that moment miss lavish and her localcolour box moved also and disappeared down a side street both gesticulating largely
tears of indignation came to lucys eyes partly because miss lavish had jilted her partly because she had taken her baedeker
how could she find her way home
how could she find her way about in santa croce
her first morning was ruined and she might never be in florence again
a few minutes ago she had been all high spirits talking as a woman of culture and half persuading herself that she was full of originality
now she entered the church depressed and humiliated not even able to remember whether it was built by the franciscans or the dominicans
of course it must be a wonderful building
but how like a barn
and how very cold
of course it contained frescoes by giotto in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper
but who was to tell her which they were
she walked about disdainfully unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date
there was no one even to tell her which of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts was the one that was really beautiful the one that had been most praised by mr ruskin
then the pernicious charm of italy worked on her and instead of acquiring information she began to be happy
she puzzled out the italian noticesthe notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the churchthe notice that prayed people in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves not to spit
she watched the tourists their noses were as red as their baedekers so cold was santa croce
she beheld the horrible fate that overtook three papiststwo hebabies and a shebabywho began their career by sousing each other with the holy water and then proceeded to the machiavelli memorial dripping but hallowed
advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances they touched the stone with their fingers with their handkerchiefs with their heads and then retreated
what could this mean
they did it again and again
then lucy realized that they had mistaken machiavelli for some saint hoping to acquire virtue
punishment followed quickly
the smallest hebaby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by mr ruskin and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop
protestant as she was lucy darted forward
she was too late
he fell heavily upon the prelates upturned toes
hateful bishop exclaimed the voice of old mr emerson who had darted forward also
hard in life hard in death
go out into the sunshine little boy and kiss your hand to the sun for that is where you ought to be
intolerable bishop  the child screamed frantically at these words and at these dreadful people who picked him up dusted him rubbed his bruises and told him not to be superstitious
look at him said mr emerson to lucy
heres a mess a baby hurt cold and frightened
but what else can you expect from a church  the childs legs had become as melting wax
each time that old mr emerson and lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar
fortunately an italian lady who ought to have been saying her prayers came to the rescue
by some mysterious virtue which mothers alone possess she stiffened the little boys backbone and imparted strength to his knees
he stood
still gibbering with agitation he walked away
you are a clever woman said mr emerson
you have done more than all the relics in the world
i am not of your creed but i do believe in those who make their fellowcreatures happy
there is no scheme of the universe  he paused for a phrase
niente said the italian lady and returned to her prayers
im not sure she understands english suggested lucy
in her chastened mood she no longer despised the emersons
she was determined to be gracious to them beautiful rather than delicate and if possible to erase miss bartletts civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms
that woman understands everything was mr emersons reply
but what are you doing here
are you doing the church
are you through with the church  no cried lucy remembering her grievance
i came here with miss lavish who was to explain everything and just by the doorit is too badshe simply ran away and after waiting quite a time i had to come in by myself  why shouldnt you said mr emerson
yes why shouldnt you come by yourself said the son addressing the young lady for the first time
but miss lavish has even taken away baedeker  baedeker said mr emerson
im glad its that you minded
its worth minding the loss of a baedeker
thats worth minding  lucy was puzzled
she was again conscious of some new idea and was not sure whither it would lead her
if youve no baedeker said the son youd better join us was this where the idea would lead
she took refuge in her dignity
thank you very much but i could not think of that
i hope you do not suppose that i came to join on to you
i really came to help with the child and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night
i hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience  my dear said the old man gently i think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say
you are pretending to be touchy but you are not really
stop being so tiresome and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see
to take you to it will be a real pleasure  now this was abominably impertinent and she ought to have been furious
but it is sometimes as difficult to lose ones temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it
lucy could not get cross
mr emerson was an old man and surely a girl might humour him
on the other hand his son was a young man and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him or at all events be offended before him
it was at him that she gazed before replying
i am not touchy i hope
it is the giottos that i want to see if you will kindly tell me which they are  the son nodded
with a look of sombre satisfaction he led the way to the peruzzi chapel
there was a hint of the teacher about him
she felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly
the chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer directing them how to worship giotto not by tactful valuations but by the standards of the spirit
remember he was saying the facts about this church of santa croce how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism before any taint of the renaissance had appeared
observe how giotto in these frescoesnow unhappily ruined by restorationis untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective
could anything be more majestic more pathetic beautiful true
how little we feel avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels  no exclaimed mr emerson in much too loud a voice for church
remember nothing of the sort
built by faith indeed
that simply means the workmen werent paid properly
and as for the frescoes i see no truth in them
look at that fat man in blue
he must weigh as much as i do and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon  he was referring to the fresco of the ascension of st john inside the lecturers voice faltered as well it might
the audience shifted uneasily and so did lucy
she was sure that she ought not to be with these men but they had cast a spell over her
they were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave
now did this happen or didnt it
yes or no  george replied  it happened like this if it happened at all
i would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs and if i got there i should like my friends to lean out of it just as they do here  you will never go up said his father
you and i dear boy will lie at peace in the earth that bore us and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives  some of the people can only see the empty grave not the saint whoever he is going up
it did happen like that if it happened at all  pardon me said a frigid voice
the chapel is somewhat small for two parties
we will incommode you no longer  the lecturer was a clergyman and his audience must be also his flock for they held prayerbooks as well as guidebooks in their hands
they filed out of the chapel in silence
amongst them were the two little old ladies of the pension bertolinimiss teresa and miss catherine alan
stop cried mr emerson
theres plenty of room for us all
stop  the procession disappeared without a word
soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel describing the life of st francis
george i do believe that clergyman is the brixton curate  george went into the next chapel and returned saying perhaps he is
i dont remember  then i had better speak to him and remind him who i am
its that mr
eager
why did he go
did we talk too loud
how vexatious
i shall go and say we are sorry
hadnt i better
then perhaps he will come back  he will not come back said george
but mr emerson contrite and unhappy hurried away to apologize to the rev
cuthbert eager
lucy apparently absorbed in a lunette could hear the lecture again interrupted the anxious aggressive voice of the old man the curt injured replies of his opponent
the son who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy was listening also
my father has that effect on nearly everyone he informed her
he will try to be kind  i hope we all try said she smiling nervously
because we think it improves our characters
but he is kind to people because he loves them and they find him out and are offended or frightened  how silly of them said lucy though in her heart she sympathized i think that a kind action done tactfully  tact  he threw up his head in disdain
apparently she had given the wrong answer
she watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel
for a young man his face was rugged anduntil the shadows fell upon ithard
enshadowed it sprang into tenderness
she saw him once again at rome on the ceiling of the sistine chapel carrying a burden of acorns
healthy and muscular he yet gave her the feeling of greyness of tragedy that might only find solution in the night
the feeling soon passed it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle
born of silence and of unknown emotion it passed when mr emerson returned and she could reenter the world of rapid talk which was alone familiar to her
were you snubbed asked his son tranquilly
but we have spoilt the pleasure of i dont know how many people
they wont come back  full of innate sympathyquickness to perceive good in othersvision of the brotherhood of man scraps of the lecture on st francis came floating round the partition wall
dont let us spoil yours he continued to lucy
have you looked at those saints  yes said lucy
they are lovely
do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in ruskin  he did not know and suggested that they should try to guess it
george rather to her relief refused to move and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about santa croce which though it is like a barn has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls
there were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars and an old lady with her dog and here and there a priest modestly edging to his mass through the groups of tourists
but mr emerson was only half interested
he watched the lecturer whose success he believed he had impaired and then he anxiously watched his son
why will he look at that fresco he said uneasily
i saw nothing in it  i like giotto she replied
it is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values
though i like things like the della robbia babies better  so you ought
a baby is worth a dozen saints
and my babys worth the whole of paradise and as far as i can see he lives in hell  lucy again felt that this did not do
in hell he repeated
hes unhappy  oh dear said lucy
how can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive
what more is one to give him
and think how he has been brought upfree from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of god
with such an education as that i thought he was bound to grow up happy  she was no theologian but she felt that here was a very foolish old man as well as a very irreligious one
she also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person and that charlotte would object most strongly
what are we to do with him he asked
he comes out for his holiday to italy and behaveslike that like the little child who ought to have been playing and who hurt himself upon the tombstone
eh
what did you say  lucy had made no suggestion
suddenly he said  now dont be stupid over this
i dont require you to fall in love with my boy but i do think you might try and understand him
you are nearer his age and if you let yourself go i am sure you are sensible
you might help me
he has known so few women and you have the time
you stop here several weeks i suppose
but let yourself go
you are inclined to get muddled if i may judge from last night
let yourself go
pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them
by understanding george you may learn to understand yourself
it will be good for both of you  to this extraordinary speech lucy found no answer
i only know what it is thats wrong with him not why it is  and what is it asked lucy fearfully expecting some harrowing tale
the old trouble things wont fit  what things  the things of the universe
it is quite true
they dont  oh mr emerson whatever do you mean  in his ordinary voice so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry he said  from far from eve and morning     and yon twelvewinded sky the stuff of life to knit me     blew hither here am i   george and i both know this but why does it distress him
we know that we come from the winds and that we shall return to them that all life is perhaps a knot a tangle a blemish in the eternal smoothness
but why should this make us unhappy
let us rather love one another and work and rejoice
i dont believe in this world sorrow  miss honeychurch assented
then make my boy think like us
make him realize that by the side of the everlasting why there is a yesa transitory yes if you like but a yes  suddenly she laughed surely one ought to laugh
a young man melancholy because the universe wouldnt fit because life was a tangle or a wind or a yes or something
im very sorry she cried
youll think me unfeeling butbut then she became matronly
oh but your son wants employment
has he no particular hobby
why i myself have worries but i can generally forget them at the piano and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother
perhaps italy bores him you ought to try the alps or the lakes  the old mans face saddened and he touched her gently with his hand
this did not alarm her she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it
indeed he no longer alarmed her at all she regarded him as a kind thing but quite silly
her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically before she lost baedeker
the dear george now striding towards them over the tombstones seemed both pitiable and absurd
he approached his face in the shadow
he said  miss bartlett  oh good gracious me said lucy suddenly collapsing and again seeing the whole of life in a new perspective
where
where  in the nave  i see
those gossiping little miss alans must have she checked herself
poor girl exploded mr emerson
poor girl  she could not let this pass for it was just what she was feeling herself
poor girl
i fail to understand the point of that remark
i think myself a very fortunate girl i assure you
im thoroughly happy and having a splendid time
pray dont waste time mourning over me
theres enough sorrow in the world isnt there without trying to invent it
goodbye
thank you both so much for all your kindness
ah yes
there does come my cousin
a delightful morning
santa croce is a wonderful church  she joined her cousin
chapter iii music violets and the letter s   it so happened that lucy who found daily life rather chaotic entered a more solid world when she opened the piano
she was then no longer either deferential or patronizing no longer either a rebel or a slave
the kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected
the commonplace person begins to play and shoots into the empyrean without effort whilst we look up marvelling how he has escaped us and thinking how we could worship him and love him would he but translate his visions into human words and his experiences into human actions
perhaps he cannot certainly he does not or does so very seldom
lucy had done so never
she was no dazzling excutante her runs were not at all like strings of pearls and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation
nor was she the passionate young lady who performs so tragically on a summers evening with the window open
passion was there but it could not be easily labelled it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy and all the furniture of the pictorial style
and she was tragical only in the sense that she was great for she loved to play on the side of victory
victory of what and over whatthat is more than the words of daily life can tell us
but that some sonatas of beethoven are written tragic no one can gainsay yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides and lucy had decided that they should triumph
a very wet afternoon at the bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked and after lunch she opened the little draped piano
a few people lingered round and praised her playing but finding that she made no reply dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep
she took no notice of mr emerson looking for his son nor of miss bartlett looking for miss lavish nor of miss lavish looking for her cigarettecase
like every true performer she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes they were fingers caressing her own and by touch not by sound alone did she come to her desire
mr beebe sitting unnoticed in the window pondered this illogical element in miss honeychurch and recalled the occasion at tunbridge wells when he had discovered it
it was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower
the seats were filled with a respectful audience and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish under the auspices of their vicar sang or recited or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork
among the promised items was miss honeychurch
piano
beethoven and mr beebe was wondering whether it would be adelaida or the march of the ruins of athens when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of opus iii
he was in suspense all through the introduction for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends
with the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory
he was glad that she only played the first movement for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of ninesixteen
the audience clapped no less respectful
it was mr beebe who started the stamping it was all that one could do
who is she he asked the vicar afterwards
cousin of one of my parishioners
i do not consider her choice of a piece happy
beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that which if anything disturbs  introduce me  she will be delighted
she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon  my sermon cried mr beebe
why ever did she listen to it  when he was introduced he understood why for miss honeychurch disjoined from her music stool was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty pale undeveloped face
she loved going to concerts she loved stopping with her cousin she loved iced coffee and meringues
he did not doubt that she loved his sermon also
but before he left tunbridge wells he made a remark to the vicar which he now made to lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him  if miss honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays it will be very exciting both for us and for her  lucy at once reentered daily life
oh what a funny thing
some one said just the same to mother and she said she trusted i should never live a duet  doesnt mrs honeychurch like music  she doesnt mind it
but she doesnt like one to get excited over anything she thinks i am silly about it
she thinksi cant make out
once you know i said that i liked my own playing better than any ones
she has never got over it
of course i didnt mean that i played well i only meant  of course said he wondering why she bothered to explain
music said lucy as if attempting some generality
she could not complete it and looked out absently upon italy in the wet
the whole life of the south was disorganized and the most graceful nation in europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes
the street and the river were dirty yellow the bridge was dirty grey and the hills were dirty purple
somewhere in their folds were concealed miss lavish and miss bartlett who had chosen this afternoon to visit the torre del gallo
what about music said mr beebe
poor charlotte will be sopped was lucys reply
the expedition was typical of miss bartlett who would return cold tired hungry and angelic with a ruined skirt a pulpy baedeker and a tickling cough in her throat
on another day when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth like wine she would refuse to stir from the drawingroom saying that she was an old thing and no fit companion for a hearty girl
miss lavish has led your cousin astray
she hopes to find the true italy in the wet i believe  miss lavish is so original murmured lucy
this was a stock remark the supreme achievement of the pension bertolini in the way of definition
miss lavish was so original
mr beebe had his doubts but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness
for that and for other reasons he held his peace
is it true continued lucy in awestruck tone that miss lavish is writing a book  they do say so  what is it about  it will be a novel replied mr beebe dealing with modern italy
let me refer you for an account to miss catharine alan who uses words herself more admirably than any one i know  i wish miss lavish would tell me herself
we started such friends
but i dont think she ought to have run away with baedeker that morning in santa croce
charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone and so i couldnt help being a little annoyed with miss lavish  the two ladies at all events have made it up  he was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as miss bartlett and miss lavish
they were always in each others company with lucy a slighted third
miss lavish he believed he understood but miss bartlett might reveal unknown depths of strangeness though not perhaps of meaning
was italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon which he had assigned to her at tunbridge wells
all his life he had loved to study maiden ladies they were his specialty and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work
girls like lucy were charming to look at but mr beebe was from rather profound reasons somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled
lucy for the third time said that poor charlotte would be sopped
the arno was rising in flood washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore
but in the southwest there had appeared a dull haze of yellow which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse
she opened the window to inspect and a cold blast entered the room drawing a plaintive cry from miss catharine alan who entered at the same moment by the door
oh dear miss honeychurch you will catch a chill
and mr beebe here besides
who would suppose this is italy
there is my sister actually nursing the hotwater can no comforts or proper provisions  she sidled towards them and sat down selfconscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man or a man and one woman
i could hear your beautiful playing miss honeychurch though i was in my room with the door shut
doors shut indeed most necessary
no one has the least idea of privacy in this country
and one person catches it from another  lucy answered suitably
mr beebe was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at modena where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath exclaiming cheerfully fa niente sono vecchia he contented himself with saying i quite agree with you miss alan
the italians are a most unpleasant people
they pry everywhere they see everything and they know what we want before we know it ourselves
we are at their mercy
they read our thoughts they foretell our desires
from the cabdriver down toto giotto they turn us inside out and i resent it
yet in their heart of hearts they arehow superficial
they have no conception of the intellectual life
how right is signora bertolini who exclaimed to me the other day ho mr beebe if you knew what i suffer over the childrens edjucaishion
hi wont ave my little victorier taught by a hignorant italian what cant explain nothink  miss alan did not follow but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way
her sister was a little disappointed in mr beebe having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers
indeed who would have supposed that tolerance sympathy and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form
in the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle and at last the cause was disclosed
from the chair beneath her she extracted a gunmetal cigarettecase on which were powdered in turquoise the initials e
l  that belongs to lavish said the clergyman
a good fellow lavish but i wish shed start a pipe  oh mr beebe said miss alan divided between awe and mirth
indeed though it is dreadful for her to smoke it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose
she took to it practically in despair after her lifes work was carried away in a landslip
surely that makes it more excusable  what was that asked lucy
mr beebe sat back complacently and miss alan began as follows it was a noveland i am afraid from what i can gather not a very nice novel
it is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them and i must say they nearly always do
anyhow she left it almost finished in the grotto of the calvary at the capuccini hotel at amalfi while she went for a little ink
she said can i have a little ink please but you know what italians are and meanwhile the grotto fell roaring on to the beach and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written
the poor thing was very ill after it and so got tempted into cigarettes
it is a great secret but i am glad to say that she is writing another novel
she told teresa and miss pole the other day that she had got up all the local colourthis novel is to be about modern italy the other was historicalbut that she could not start till she had an idea
first she tried perugia for an inspiration then she came herethis must on no account get round
and so cheerful through it all
i cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone even if you do not approve of them  miss alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement
a delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks giving them unexpected beauty just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring
she felt she had made almost too many allowances and apologized hurriedly for her toleration
all the same she is a little tooi hardly like to say unwomanly but she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived  mr beebe smiled as miss alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman
i dont know miss honeychurch if you have noticed that miss pole the lady who has so much yellow hair takes lemonade
that old mr emerson who puts things very strangely  her jaw dropped
she was silent
mr beebe whose social resources were endless went out to order some tea and she continued to lucy in a hasty whisper  stomach
he warned miss pole of her stomachacidity he called itand he may have meant to be kind
i must say i forgot myself and laughed it was so sudden
as teresa truly said it was no laughing matter
but the point is that miss lavish was positively attracted by his mentioning s and said she liked plain speaking and meeting different grades of thought
she thought they were commercial travellersdrummers was the word she usedand all through dinner she tried to prove that england our great and beloved country rests on nothing but commerce
teresa was very much annoyed and left the table before the cheese saying as she did so there miss lavish is one who can confute you better than i and pointed to that beautiful picture of lord tennyson
then miss lavish said tut
the early victorians just imagine
tut
the early victorians my sister had gone and i felt bound to speak
i said miss lavish i am an early victorian at least that is to say i will hear no breath of censure against our dear queen it was horrible speaking
i reminded her how the queen had been to ireland when she did not want to go and i must say she was dumbfounded and made no reply
but unluckily mr emerson overheard this part and called in his deep voice quite so quite so
i honour the woman for her irish visit the woman
i tell things so badly but you see what a tangle we were in by this time all on account of s having been mentioned in the first place
but that was not all
after dinner miss lavish actually came up and said miss alan i am going into the smokingroom to talk to those two nice men
come too needless to say i refused such an unsuitable invitation and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas and said that she had four brothers all university men except one who was in the army who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers  let me finish the story said mr beebe who had returned
miss lavish tried miss pole myself everyone and finally said i shall go alone she went
at the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board and began playing patience  whatever happened cried lucy
no one knows
no one will ever know
miss lavish will never dare to tell and mr emerson does not think it worth telling  mr
beebeold mr emerson is he nice or not nice
i do so want to know  mr beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself
no but it is so difficult
sometimes he is so silly and then i do not mind him
miss alan what do you think
is he nice  the little old lady shook her head and sighed disapprovingly
mr beebe whom the conversation amused stirred her up by saying  i consider that you are bound to class him as nice miss alan after that business of the violets  violets
oh dear
who told you about the violets
how do things get round
a pension is a bad place for gossips
no i cannot forget how they behaved at mr eagers lecture at santa croce
oh poor miss honeychurch
it really was too bad
no i have quite changed
i do not like the emersons
they are not nice  mr beebe smiled nonchalantly
he had made a gentle effort to introduce the emersons into bertolini society and the effort had failed
he was almost the only person who remained friendly to them
miss lavish who represented intellect was avowedly hostile and now the miss alans who stood for good breeding were following her
miss bartlett smarting under an obligation would scarcely be civil
the case of lucy was different
she had given him a hazy account of her adventures in santa croce and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her to show her the world from their own strange standpoint to interest her in their private sorrows and joys
this was impertinent he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl he would rather it should fail
after all he knew nothing about them and pension joys pension sorrows are flimsy things whereas lucy would be his parishioner
lucy with one eye upon the weather finally said that she thought the emersons were nice not that she saw anything of them now
even their seats at dinner had been moved
but arent they always waylaying you to go out with them dear said the little lady inquisitively
only once
charlotte didnt like it and said somethingquite politely of course  most right of her
they dont understand our ways
they must find their level  mr beebe rather felt that they had gone under
they had given up their attemptif it was oneto conquer society and now the father was almost as silent as the son
he wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they leftsome expedition perhaps with lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them
it was one of mr beebes chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories
evening approached while they chatted the air became brighter the colours on the trees and hills were purified and the arno lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle
there were a few streaks of bluishgreen among the clouds a few patches of watery light upon the earth and then the dripping faade of san miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun
too late to go out said miss alan in a voice of relief
all the galleries are shut  i think i shall go out said lucy
i want to go round the town in the circular tramon the platform by the driver  her two companions looked grave
mr beebe who felt responsible for her in the absence of miss bartlett ventured to say  i wish we could
unluckily i have letters
if you do want to go out alone wont you be better on your feet  italians dear you know said miss alan
perhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through  but they still looked disapproval and she so far conceded to mr beebe as to say that she would only go for a little walk and keep to the street frequented by tourists
she oughtnt really to go at all said mr beebe as they watched her from the window and she knows it
i put it down to too much beethoven     chapter iv fourth chapter   mr beebe was right
lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after music
she had not really appreciated the clergymans wit nor the suggestive twitterings of miss alan
conversation was tedious she wanted something big and she believed that it would have come to her on the windswept platform of an electric tram
this she might not attempt
it was unladylike
why
why were most big things unladylike
charlotte had once explained to her why
it was not that ladies were inferior to men it was that they were different
their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves
indirectly by means of tact and a spotless name a lady could accomplish much
but if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured then despised and finally ignored
poems had been written to illustrate this point
there is much that is immortal in this medieval lady
the dragons have gone and so have the knights but still she lingers in our midst
she reigned in many an early victorian castle and was queen of much early victorian song
it is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well
but alas
the creature grows degenerate
in her heart also there are springing up strange desires
she too is enamoured of heavy winds and vast panoramas and green expanses of the sea
she has marked the kingdom of this world how full it is of wealth and beauty and wara radiant crust built around the central fires spinning towards the receding heavens
men declaring that she inspires them to it move joyfully over the surface having the most delightful meetings with other men happy not because they are masculine but because they are alive
before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the eternal woman and go there as her transitory self
lucy does not stand for the medieval lady who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious
nor has she any system of revolt
here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly and she would transgress it and perhaps be sorry that she had done so
this afternoon she was peculiarly restive
she would really like to do something of which her wellwishers disapproved
as she might not go on the electric tram she went to alinaris shop
there she bought a photograph of botticellis birth of venus venus being a pity spoilt the picture otherwise so charming and miss bartlett had persuaded her to do without it
a pity in art of course signified the nude
giorgiones tempesta the idolino some of the sistine frescoes and the apoxyomenos were added to it
she felt a little calmer then and bought fra angelicos coronation giottos ascension of st john some della robbia babies and some guido reni madonnas
for her taste was catholic and she extended uncritical approval to every wellknown name
but though she spent nearly seven lire the gates of liberty seemed still unopened
she was conscious of her discontent it was new to her to be conscious of it
the world she thought is certainly full of beautiful things if only i could come across them it was not surprising that mrs honeychurch disapproved of music declaring that it always left her daughter peevish unpractical and touchy
nothing ever happens to me she reflected as she entered the piazza signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels now fairly familiar to her
the great square was in shadow the sunshine had come too late to strike it
neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight half god half ghost and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge
the loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave wherein many a deity shadowy but immortal looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind
it was the hour of unrealitythe hour that is when unfamiliar things are real
an older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him and rest content
lucy desired more
she fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold
it seemed no longer a tower no longer supported by earth but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky
its brightness mesmerized her still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home
then something did happen
two italians by the loggia had been bickering about a debt
cinque lire they had cried cinque lire they sparred at each other and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest
he frowned he bent towards lucy with a look of interest as if he had an important message for her
he opened his lips to deliver it and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin
that was all
a crowd rose out of the dusk
it hid this extraordinary man from her and bore him away to the fountain
mr george emerson happened to be a few paces away looking at her across the spot where the man had been
how very odd
across something
even as she caught sight of him he grew dim the palace itself grew dim swayed above her fell on to her softly slowly noiselessly and the sky fell with it
she thought oh what have i done  oh what have i done she murmured and opened her eyes
george emerson still looked at her but not across anything
she had complained of dullness and lo
one man was stabbed and another held her in his arms
they were sitting on some steps in the uffizi arcade
he must have carried her
he rose when she spoke and began to dust his knees
she repeated  oh what have i done  you fainted  ii am very sorry  how are you now  perfectly wellabsolutely well and she began to nod and smile
then let us come home
theres no point in our stopping  he held out his hand to pull her up
she pretended not to see it
the cries from the fountainthey had never ceasedrang emptily
the whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning
how very kind you have been
i might have hurt myself falling
but now i am well
i can go alone thank you  his hand was still extended
oh my photographs she exclaimed suddenly
what photographs  i bought some photographs at alinaris
i must have dropped them out there in the square she looked at him cautiously
would you add to your kindness by fetching them  he added to his kindness
as soon as he had turned his back lucy arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the arno
miss honeychurch  she stopped with her hand on her heart
you sit still you arent fit to go home alone  yes i am thank you so very much  no you arent
youd go openly if you were  but i had rather  then i dont fetch your photographs  i had rather be alone  he said imperiously the man is deadthe man is probably dead sit down till you are rested she was bewildered and obeyed him
and dont move till i come back  in the distance she saw creatures with black hoods such as appear in dreams
the palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day and joined itself to earth
how should she talk to mr emerson when he returned from the shadowy square
again the thought occurred to her oh what have i donethe thought that she as well as the dying man had crossed some spiritual boundary
he returned and she talked of the murder
oddly enough it was an easy topic
she spoke of the italian character she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before
being strong physically she soon overcame the horror of blood
she rose without his assistance and though wings seemed to flutter inside her she walked firmly enough towards the arno
there a cabman signalled to them they refused him
and the murderer tried to kiss him you sayhow very odd italians areand gave himself up to the police
mr beebe was saying that italians know everything but i think they are rather childish
when my cousin and i were at the pitti yesterdaywhat was that  he had thrown something into the stream
what did you throw in  things i didnt want he said crossly
mr
emerson  well  where are the photographs  he was silent
i believe it was my photographs that you threw away  i didnt know what to do with them he cried and his voice was that of an anxious boy
her heart warmed towards him for the first time
they were covered with blood
there
im glad ive told you and all the time we were making conversation i was wondering what to do with them he pointed downstream
theyve gone the river swirled under the bridge i did mind them so and one is so foolish it seemed better that they should go out to the seai dont know i may just mean that they frightened me then the boy verged into a man
for something tremendous has happened i must face it without getting muddled
it isnt exactly that a man has died  something warned lucy that she must stop him
it has happened he repeated and i mean to find out what it is  mr
emerson  he turned towards her frowning as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest
i want to ask you something before we go in  they were close to their pension
she stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment
he did likewise
there is at times a magic in identity of position it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship
she moved her elbows before saying  i have behaved ridiculously  he was following his own thoughts
i was never so much ashamed of myself in my life i cannot think what came over me  i nearly fainted myself he said but she felt that her attitude repelled him
well i owe you a thousand apologies  oh all right  andthis is the real pointyou know how silly people are gossipingladies especially i am afraidyou understand what i mean  im afraid i dont  i mean would you not mention it to any one my foolish behaviour  your behaviour
oh yes all rightall right  thank you so much
and would you  she could not carry her request any further
the river was rushing below them almost black in the advancing night
he had thrown her photographs into it and then he had told her the reason
it struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man
he would do her no harm by idle gossip he was trustworthy intelligent and even kind he might even have a high opinion of her
but he lacked chivalry his thoughts like his behaviour would not be modified by awe
it was useless to say to him and would you and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture
she had been in his arms and he remembered it just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in alinaris shop
it was not exactly that a man had died something had happened to the living they had come to a situation where character tells and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of youth
well thank you so much she repeated how quickly these accidents do happen and then one returns to the old life  i dont  anxiety moved her to question him
his answer was puzzling i shall probably want to live  but why mr emerson
what do you mean  i shall want to live i say  leaning her elbows on the parapet she contemplated the river arno whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears
chapter v possibilities of a pleasant outing   it was a family saying that you never knew which way charlotte bartlett would turn she was perfectly pleasant and sensible over lucys adventure found the abridged account of it quite adequate and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of mr george emerson
she and miss lavish had had an adventure also
they had been stopped at the dazio coming back and the young officials there who seemed impudent and dsuvr had tried to search their reticules for provisions
it might have been most unpleasant
fortunately miss lavish was a match for any one
for good or for evil lucy was left to face her problem alone
none of her friends had seen her either in the piazza or later on by the embankment
mr beebe indeed noticing her startled eyes at dinnertime had again passed to himself the remark of too much beethoven but he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure not that she had encountered it
this solitude oppressed her she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or at all events contradicted it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong
at breakfast next morning she took decisive action
there were two plans between which she had to choose
mr beebe was walking up to the torre del gallo with the emersons and some american ladies
would miss bartlett and miss honeychurch join the party
charlotte declined for herself she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon
but she thought it an admirable idea for lucy who hated shopping changing money fetching letters and other irksome dutiesall of which miss bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone
no charlotte cried the girl with real warmth
its very kind of mr beebe but i am certainly coming with you
i had much rather  very well dear said miss bartlett with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of lucy
how abominably she behaved to charlotte now as always
but now she should alter
all morning she would be really nice to her
she slipped her arm into her cousins and they started off along the lung arno
the river was a lion that morning in strength voice and colour
miss bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it
she then made her usual remark which was how i do wish freddy and your mother could see this too  lucy fidgeted it was tiresome of charlotte to have stopped exactly where she did
look lucia
oh you are watching for the torre del gallo party
i feared you would repent you of your choice  serious as the choice had been lucy did not repent
yesterday had been a muddlequeer and odd the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paperbut she had a feeling that charlotte and her shopping were preferable to george emerson and the summit of the torre del gallo
since she could not unravel the tangle she must take care not to reenter it
she could protest sincerely against miss bartletts insinuations
but though she had avoided the chief actor the scenery unfortunately remained
charlotte with the complacency of fate led her from the river to the piazza signoria
she could not have believed that stones a loggia a fountain a palace tower would have such significance
for a moment she understood the nature of ghosts
the exact site of the murder was occupied not by a ghost but by miss lavish who had the morning newspaper in her hand
she hailed them briskly
the dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book
oh let me congratulate you said miss bartlett
after your despair of yesterday
what a fortunate thing  aha
miss honeychurch come you here i am in luck
now you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning lucy poked at the ground with her parasol
but perhaps you would rather not  im sorryif you could manage without it i think i would rather not  the elder ladies exchanged glances not of disapproval it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply
it is i who am sorry said miss lavish literary hacks are shameless creatures
i believe theres no secret of the human heart into which we wouldnt pry  she marched cheerfully to the fountain and back and did a few calculations in realism
then she said that she had been in the piazza since eight oclock collecting material
a good deal of it was unsuitable but of course one always had to adapt
the two men had quarrelled over a fivefranc note
for the fivefranc note she should substitute a young lady which would raise the tone of the tragedy and at the same time furnish an excellent plot
what is the heroines name asked miss bartlett
leonora said miss lavish her own name was eleanor
i do hope shes nice  that desideratum would not be omitted
and what is the plot  love murder abduction revenge was the plot
but it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun
i hope you will excuse me for boring on like this miss lavish concluded
it is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people
of course this is the barest outline
there will be a deal of local colouring descriptions of florence and the neighbourhood and i shall also introduce some humorous characters
and let me give you all fair warning i intend to be unmerciful to the british tourist  oh you wicked woman cried miss bartlett
i am sure you are thinking of the emersons  miss lavish gave a machiavellian smile
i confess that in italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen
it is the neglected italians who attract me and whose lives i am going to paint so far as i can
for i repeat and i insist and i have always held most strongly that a tragedy such as yesterdays is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life  there was a fitting silence when miss lavish had concluded
then the cousins wished success to her labours and walked slowly away across the square
she is my idea of a really clever woman said miss bartlett
that last remark struck me as so particularly true
it should be a most pathetic novel  lucy assented
at present her great aim was not to get put into it
her perceptions this morning were curiously keen and she believed that miss lavish had her on trial for an ingenu
she is emancipated but only in the very best sense of the word continued miss bartlett slowly
none but the superficial would be shocked at her
we had a long talk yesterday
she believes in justice and truth and human interest
she told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of womanmr
eager
why how nice
what a pleasant surprise  ah not for me said the chaplain blandly for i have been watching you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time  we were chatting to miss lavish  his brow contracted
so i saw
were you indeed
andate via
sono occupato the last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile
i am about to venture a suggestion
would you and miss honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this weeka drive in the hills
we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano
there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hours ramble on the hillside
the view thence of florence is most beautifulfar better than the hackneyed view of fiesole
it is the view that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures
that man had a decided feeling for landscape
decidedly
but who looks at it today
ah the world is too much for us  miss bartlett had not heard of alessio baldovinetti but she knew that mr
eager was no commonplace chaplain
he was a member of the residential colony who had made florence their home
he knew the people who never walked about with baedekers who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them
living in delicate seclusion some in furnished flats others in renaissance villas on fiesoles slope they read wrote studied and exchanged ideas thus attaining to that intimate knowledge or rather perception of florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of cook
therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of
between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent
tea at a renaissance villa
nothing had been said about it yet
but if it did come to thathow lucy would enjoy it
a few days ago and lucy would have felt the same
but the joys of life were grouping themselves anew
a drive in the hills with mr
eager and miss bartletteven if culminating in a residential teapartywas no longer the greatest of them
she echoed the raptures of charlotte somewhat faintly
only when she heard that mr beebe was also coming did her thanks become more sincere
so we shall be a partie carre said the chaplain
in these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity
andate via
andate presto presto
ah the town
beautiful as it is it is the town  they assented
this very squareso i am toldwitnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies
to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola there is something portentous in such desecrationportentous and humiliating  humiliating indeed said miss bartlett
miss honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened
she can hardly bear to speak of it she glanced at lucy proudly
and how came we to have you here asked the chaplain paternally
miss bartletts recent liberalism oozed away at the question
do not blame her please mr
eager
the fault is mine i left her unchaperoned  so you were here alone miss honeychurch his voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable
his dark handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply
practically  one of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home said miss bartlett adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver
for her also it must have been a terrible experience
i trust that neither of you was at allthat it was not in your immediate proximity  of the many things lucy was noticing today not the least remarkable was this the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood
george emerson had kept the subject strangely pure
he died by the fountain i believe was her reply
and you and your friend  were over at the loggia  that must have saved you much
you have not of course seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter pressthis man is a public nuisance he knows that i am a resident perfectly well and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views  surely the vendor of photographs was in league with lucyin the eternal league of italy with youth
he had suddenly extended his book before miss bartlett and mr
eager binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches pictures and views
this is too much cried the chaplain striking petulantly at one of fra angelicos angels
she tore
a shrill cry rose from the vendor
the book it seemed was more valuable than one would have supposed
willingly would i purchase began miss bartlett
ignore him said mr
eager sharply and they all walked rapidly away from the square
but an italian can never be ignored least of all when he has a grievance
his mysterious persecution of mr
eager became relentless the air rang with his threats and lamentations
he appealed to lucy would not she intercede
he was poorhe sheltered a familythe tax on bread
he waited he gibbered he was recompensed he was dissatisfied he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant
shopping was the topic that now ensued
under the chaplains guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoesflorid little pictureframes that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry other little frames more severe that stood on little easels and were carven out of oak a blotting book of vellum a dante of the same material cheap mosaic brooches which the maids next christmas would never tell from real pins pots heraldic saucers brown artphotographs eros and psyche in alabaster st peter to matchall of which would have cost less in london
this successful morning left no pleasant impressions on lucy
she had been a little frightened both by miss lavish and by mr
eager she knew not why
and as they frightened her she had strangely enough ceased to respect them
she doubted that miss lavish was a great artist
she doubted that mr
eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose
they were tried by some new test and they were found wanting
as for charlotteas for charlotte she was exactly the same
it might be possible to be nice to her it was impossible to love her
the son of a labourer i happen to know it for a fact
a mechanic of some sort himself when he was young then he took to writing for the socialistic press
i came across him at brixton  they were talking about the emersons
how wonderfully people rise in these days sighed miss bartlett fingering a model of the leaning tower of pisa
generally replied mr
eager one has only sympathy for their success
the desire for education and for social advancein these things there is something not wholly vile
there are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in florencelittle as they would make of it  is he a journalist now miss bartlett asked
he is not he made an advantageous marriage  he uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning and ended with a sigh
oh so he has a wife  dead miss bartlett dead
i wonderyes i wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face to dare to claim acquaintance with me
he was in my london parish long ago
the other day in santa croce when he was with miss honeychurch i snubbed him
let him beware that he does not get more than a snub  what cried lucy flushing
exposure hissed mr
eager
he tried to change the subject but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended
miss bartlett was full of very natural curiosity
lucy though she wished never to see the emersons again was not disposed to condemn them on a single word
do you mean she asked that he is an irreligious man
we know that already  lucy dear said miss bartlett gently reproving her cousins penetration
i should be astonished if you knew all
the boyan innocent child at the timei will exclude
god knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him  perhaps said miss bartlett it is something that we had better not hear  to speak plainly said mr
eager it is
i will say no more for the first time lucys rebellious thoughts swept out in wordsfor the first time in her life
you have said very little  it was my intention to say very little was his frigid reply
he gazed indignantly at the girl who met him with equal indignation
she turned towards him from the shop counter her breast heaved quickly
he observed her brow and the sudden strength of her lips
it was intolerable that she should disbelieve him
murder if you want to know he cried angrily
that man murdered his wife  how she retorted
to all intents and purposes he murdered her
that day in santa crocedid they say anything against me  not a word mr eagernot a single word  oh i thought they had been libelling me to you
but i suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them  im not defending them said lucy losing her courage and relapsing into the old chaotic methods
theyre nothing to me  how could you think she was defending them said miss bartlett much discomfited by the unpleasant scene
the shopman was possibly listening
she will find it difficult
for that man has murdered his wife in the sight of god  the addition of god was striking
but the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark
a silence followed which might have been impressive but was merely awkward
then miss bartlett hastily purchased the leaning tower and led the way into the street
i must be going said he shutting his eyes and taking out his watch
miss bartlett thanked him for his kindness and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive
drive
oh is our drive to come off  lucy was recalled to her manners and after a little exertion the complacency of mr
eager was restored
bother the drive exclaimed the girl as soon as he had departed
it is just the drive we had arranged with mr beebe without any fuss at all
why should he invite us in that absurd manner
we might as well invite him
we are each paying for ourselves  miss bartlett who had intended to lament over the emersons was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts
if that is so dearif the drive we and mr beebe are going with mr
eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr beebe then i foresee a sad kettle of fish  how  because mr beebe has asked eleanor lavish to come too  that will mean another carriage  far worse
mr
eager does not like eleanor
she knows it herself
the truth must be told she is too unconventional for him  they were now in the newspaperroom at the english bank
lucy stood by the central table heedless of punch and the graphic trying to answer or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain
the wellknown world had broken up and there emerged florence a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things
murder accusations of murder a lady clinging to one man and being rude to anotherwere these the daily incidents of her streets
was there more in her frank beauty than met the eyethe power perhaps to evoke passions good and bad and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment
happy charlotte who though greatly troubled over things that did not matter seemed oblivious to things that did who could conjecture with admirable delicacy where things might lead to but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it
now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nosebag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck
she had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in italy it must only be broached within the walls of the english bank
as she groped she murmured whether it is mr beebe who forgot to tell mr
eager or mr
eager who forgot when he told us or whether they have decided to leave eleanor out altogetherwhich they could scarcely dobut in any case we must be prepared
it is you they really want i am only asked for appearances
you shall go with the two gentlemen and i and eleanor will follow behind
a onehorse carriage would do for us
yet how difficult it is  it is indeed replied the girl with a gravity that sounded sympathetic
what do you think about it asked miss bartlett flushed from the struggle and buttoning up her dress
i dont know what i think nor what i want  oh dear lucy
i do hope florence isnt boring you
speak the word and as you know i would take you to the ends of the earth tomorrow  thank you charlotte said lucy and pondered over the offer
there were letters for her at the bureauone from her brother full of athletics and biology one from her mother delightful as only her mothers letters could be
she had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce of the new parlourmaid who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade of the semidetached cottages which were ruining summer street and breaking the heart of sir harry otway
she recalled the free pleasant life of her home where she was allowed to do everything and where nothing ever happened to her
the road up through the pinewoods the clean drawingroom the view over the sussex wealdall hung before her bright and distinct but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which after much experience a traveller returns
and the news asked miss bartlett
mrs
vyse and her son have gone to rome said lucy giving the news that interested her least
do you know the vyses  oh not that way back
we can never have too much of the dear piazza signoria  theyre nice people the vyses
so clevermy idea of whats really clever
dont you long to be in rome  i die for it  the piazza signoria is too stony to be brilliant
it has no grass no flowers no frescoes no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick
by an odd chanceunless we believe in a presiding genius of placesthe statues that relieve its severity suggest not the innocence of childhood nor the glorious bewilderment of youth but the conscious achievements of maturity
perseus and judith hercules and thusnelda they have done or suffered something and though they are immortal immortality has come to them after experience not before
here not only in the solitude of nature might a hero meet a goddess or a heroine a god
charlotte cried the girl suddenly
heres an idea
what if we popped off to rome tomorrowstraight to the vyses hotel
for i do know what i want
im sick of florence
no you said youd go to the ends of the earth
do
do  miss bartlett with equal vivacity replied  oh you droll person
pray what would become of your drive in the hills  they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square laughing over the unpractical suggestion
chapter vi the reverend arthur beebe the reverend cuthbert eager mr emerson mr george emerson miss eleanor lavish miss charlotte bartlett and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a view italians drive them
it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day a youth all irresponsibility and fire recklessly urging his masters horses up the stony hill
mr beebe recognized him at once
neither the ages of faith nor the age of doubt had touched him he was phaethon in tuscany driving a cab
and it was persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on the way saying that she was his sisterpersephone tall and slender and pale returning with the spring to her mothers cottage and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light
to her mr
eager objected saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge and one must guard against imposition
but the ladies interceded and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god
phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist
she did not mind
mr
eager who sat with his back to the horses saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding and continued his conversation with lucy
the other two occupants of the carriage were old mr emerson and miss lavish
for a dreadful thing had happened mr beebe without consulting mr
eager had doubled the size of the party
and though miss bartlett and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads and miss lavish got in with lucy while miss bartlett with george emerson and mr beebe followed on behind
it was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carre thus transformed
tea at a renaissance villa if he had ever meditated it was now impossible
lucy and miss bartlett had a certain style about them and mr beebe though unreliable was a man of parts
but a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of godthey should enter no villa at his introduction
lucy elegantly dressed in white sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients attentive to mr
eager repressive towards miss lavish watchful of old mr emerson hitherto fortunately asleep thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of spring
she looked on the expedition as the work of fate
but for it she would have avoided george emerson successfully
in an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy
she had refused not because she disliked him but because she did not know what had happened and suspected that he did know
and this frightened her
for the real eventwhatever it washad taken place not in the loggia but by the river
to behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable
but to discuss it afterwards to pass from discussion into silence and through silence into sympathy that is an error not of a startled emotion but of the whole fabric
there was really something blameworthy she thought in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word
this sense of wickedness had been slight at first
she had nearly joined the party to the torre del gallo
but each time that she avoided george it became more imperative that she should avoid him again
and now celestial irony working through her cousin and two clergymen did not suffer her to leave florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills
meanwhile mr
eager held her in civil converse their little tiff was over
so miss honeychurch you are travelling
as a student of art  oh dear me nooh no  perhaps as a student of human nature interposed miss lavish like myself  oh no
i am here as a tourist  oh indeed said mr
eager
are you indeed
if you will not think me rude we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a littlehanded about like a parcel of goods from venice to florence from florence to rome living herded together in pensions or hotels quite unconscious of anything that is outside baedeker their one anxiety to get done or through and go on somewhere else
the result is they mix up towns rivers palaces in one inextricable whirl
you know the american girl in punch who says say poppa what did we see at rome and the father replies why guess rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog theres travelling for you
ha
ha
ha  i quite agree said miss lavish who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit
the narrowness and superficiality of the anglosaxon tourist is nothing less than a menace  quite so
now the english colony at florence miss honeychurchand it is of considerable size though of course not all equallya few are here for trade for example
but the greater part are students
lady helen laverstock is at present busy over fra angelico
i mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left
no you can only see it if you standno do not stand you will fall
she is very proud of that thick hedge
inside perfect seclusion
one might have gone back six hundred years
some critics believe that her garden was the scene of the decameron which lends it an additional interest does it not  it does indeed cried miss lavish
tell me where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day  but mr
eager proceeded to tell miss honeychurch that on the right lived mr
someone something an american of the best typeso rareand that the somebody elses were farther down the hill
doubtless you know her monographs in the series of medival byways
he is working at gemistus pletho
sometimes as i take tea in their beautiful grounds i hear over the wall the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot dusty unintelligent tourists who are going to do fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there and i thinkthinki think how little they think what lies so near them  during this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully
lucy had a spasm of envy
granted that they wished to misbehave it was pleasant for them to be able to do so
they were probably the only people enjoying the expedition
the carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the piazza of fiesole and into the settignano road
piano
piano said mr
eager elegantly waving his hand over his head
va bene signore va bene va bene crooned the driver and whipped his horses up again
now mr
eager and miss lavish began to talk against each other on the subject of alessio baldovinetti
was he a cause of the renaissance or was he one of its manifestations
the other carriage was left behind
as the pace increased to a gallop the large slumbering form of mr emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine
piano
piano said he with a martyred look at lucy
an extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat
phaethon who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss persephone had just succeeded
a little scene ensued which as miss bartlett said afterwards was most unpleasant
the horses were stopped the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves the boy was to lose his pourboire the girl was immediately to get down
she is my sister said he turning round on them with piteous eyes
mr
eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar
phaethon hung down his head not at the matter of the accusation but at its manner
at this point mr emerson whom the shock of stopping had awoke declared that the lovers must on no account be separated and patted them on the back to signify his approval
and miss lavish though unwilling to ally him felt bound to support the cause of bohemianism
most certainly i would let them be she cried
but i dare say i shall receive scant support
i have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life
this is what i call an adventure  we must not submit said mr
eager
i knew he was trying it on
he is treating us as if we were a party of cooks tourists  surely no said miss lavish her ardour visibly decreasing
the other carriage had drawn up behind and sensible mr beebe called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly
leave them alone mr emerson begged the chaplain of whom he stood in no awe
do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there
to be driven by loversa king might envy us and if we part them its more like sacrilege than anything i know  here the voice of miss bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect
mr
eager who suffered from an overfluent tongue rather than a resolute will was determined to make himself heard
he addressed the driver again
italian in the mouth of italians is a deepvoiced stream with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony
in mr eagers mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher and quicker and quicker and more and more shrilly till abruptly it was turned off with a click
signorina said the man to lucy when the display had ceased
why should he appeal to lucy
signorina echoed persephone in her glorious contralto
she pointed at the other carriage
why
for a moment the two girls looked at each other
then persephone got down from the box
victory at last said mr
eager smiting his hands together as the carriages started again
it is not victory said mr emerson
it is defeat
you have parted two people who were happy  mr
eager shut his eyes
he was obliged to sit next to mr emerson but he would not speak to him
the old man was refreshed by sleep and took up the matter warmly
he commanded lucy to agree with him he shouted for support to his son
we have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money
he has bargained to drive us and he is doing it
we have no rights over his soul  miss lavish frowned
it is hard when a person you have classed as typically british speaks out of his character
he was not driving us well she said
he jolted us  that i deny
it was as restful as sleeping
aha
he is jolting us now
can you wonder
he would like to throw us out and most certainly he is justified
and if i were superstitious id be frightened of the girl too
it doesnt do to injure young people
have you ever heard of lorenzo de medici  miss lavish bristled
most certainly i have
do you refer to lorenzo il magnifico or to lorenzo duke of urbino or to lorenzo surnamed lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature  the lord knows
possibly he does know for i refer to lorenzo the poet
he wrote a lineso i heard yesterdaywhich runs like this dont go fighting against the spring  mr
eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition
non fate guerra al maggio he murmured
war not with the may would render a correct meaning  the point is we have warred with it
look he pointed to the val darno which was visible far below them through the budding trees
fifty miles of spring and weve come up to admire them
do you suppose theres any difference between spring in nature and spring in man
but there we go praising the one and condemning the other as improper ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both  no one encouraged him to talk
presently mr
eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill
a hollow like a great amphitheatre full of terraced steps and misty olives now lay between them and the heights of fiesole and the road still following its curve was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain
it was this promontory uncultivated wet covered with bushes and occasional trees which had caught the fancy of alessio baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before
he had ascended it that diligent and rather obscure master possibly with an eye to business possibly for the joy of ascending
standing there he had seen that view of the val darno and distant florence which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work
but where exactly had he stood
that was the question which mr
eager hoped to solve now
and miss lavish whose nature was attracted by anything problematical had become equally enthusiastic
but it is not easy to carry the pictures of alessio baldovinetti in your head even if you have remembered to look at them before starting
and the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest
the party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions
finally they split into groups
lucy clung to miss bartlett and miss lavish the emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers while the two clergymen who were expected to have topics in common were left to each other
the two elder ladies soon threw off the mask
in the audible whisper that was now so familiar to lucy they began to discuss not alessio baldovinetti but the drive
miss bartlett had asked mr george emerson what his profession was and he had answered the railway she was very sorry that she had asked him
she had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer or she would not have asked him
mr beebe had turned the conversation so cleverly and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him
the railway gasped miss lavish
oh but i shall die
of course it was the railway she could not control her mirth
he is the image of a porteron on the southeastern  eleanor be quiet plucking at her vivacious companion
hush
theyll hearthe emersons  i cant stop
let me go my wicked way
a porter  eleanor  im sure its all right put in lucy
the emersons wont hear and they wouldnt mind if they did  miss lavish did not seem pleased at this
miss honeychurch listening she said rather crossly
pouf
wouf
you naughty girl
go away  oh lucy you ought to be with mr
eager im sure  i cant find them now and i dont want to either  mr
eager will be offended
it is your party  please id rather stop here with you  no i agree said miss lavish
its like a school feast the boys have got separated from the girls
miss lucy you are to go
we wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear  the girl was stubborn
as her time at florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent
such a one was miss lavish and such for the moment was charlotte
she wished she had not called attention to herself they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her
how tired one gets said miss bartlett
oh i do wish freddy and your mother could be here  unselfishness with miss bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm
lucy did not look at the view either
she would not enjoy anything till she was safe at rome
then sit you down said miss lavish
observe my foresight  with many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps
she sat on one who was to sit on the other
lucy without a moments doubt lucy
the ground will do for me
really i have not had rheumatism for years
if i do feel it coming on i shall stand
imagine your mothers feelings if i let you sit in the wet in your white linen she sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist
here we are all settled delightfully
even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much being brown
sit down dear you are too unselfish you dont assert yourself enough she cleared her throat
now dont be alarmed this isnt a cold
its the tiniest cough and i have had it three days
its nothing to do with sitting here at all  there was only one way of treating the situation
at the end of five minutes lucy departed in search of mr beebe and mr
eager vanquished by the mackintosh square
she addressed herself to the drivers who were sprawling in the carriages perfuming the cushions with cigars
the miscreant a bony young man scorched black by the sun rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative
dove said lucy after much anxious thought
his face lit up
of course he knew where
not so far either
his arm swept threefourths of the horizon
he should just think he did know where
he pressed his fingertips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge
more seemed necessary
what was the italian for clergyman
dove buoni uomini said she at last
good
scarcely the adjective for those noble beings
he showed her his cigar
unopiupiccolo was her next remark implying has the cigar been given to you by mr beebe the smaller of the two good men  she was correct as usual
he tied the horse to a tree kicked it to make it stay quiet dusted the carriage arranged his hair remoulded his hat encouraged his moustache and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her
italians are born knowing the way
it would seem that the whole earth lay before them not as a map but as a chessboard whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares
any one can find places but the finding of people is a gift from god
he only stopped once to pick her some great blue violets
she thanked him with real pleasure
in the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct
for the first time she felt the influence of spring
his arm swept the horizon gracefully violets like other things existed in great profusion there would she like to see them  ma buoni uomini  he bowed
certainly
good men first violets afterwards
they proceeded briskly through the undergrowth which became thicker and thicker
they were nearing the edge of the promontory and the view was stealing round them but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces
he was occupied in his cigar and in holding back the pliant boughs
she was rejoicing in her escape from dullness
not a step not a twig was unimportant to her
what is that  there was a voice in the wood in the distance behind them
the voice of mr
eager
he shrugged his shoulders
an italians ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge
she could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen
the view was forming at last she could discern the river the golden plain other hills
eccolo he exclaimed
at the same moment the ground gave way and with a cry she fell out of the wood
light and beauty enveloped her
she had fallen on to a little open terrace which was covered with violets from end to end
courage cried her companion now standing some six feet above
courage and love  she did not answer
from her feet the ground sloped sharply into view and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts irrigating the hillside with blue eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows covering the grass with spots of azure foam
but never again were they in such profusion this terrace was the wellhead the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth
standing at its brink like a swimmer who prepares was the good man
but he was not the good man that she had expected and he was alone
george had turned at the sound of her arrival
for a moment he contemplated her as one who had fallen out of heaven
he saw radiant joy in her face he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves
the bushes above them closed
he stepped quickly forward and kissed her
before she could speak almost before she could feel a voice called lucy
lucy
lucy the silence of life had been broken by miss bartlett who stood brown against the view
chapter vii they return   some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon
what it was and exactly how the players had sided lucy was slow to discover
mr
eager had met them with a questioning eye
charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk
mr emerson seeking his son was told whereabouts to find him
mr beebe who wore the heated aspect of a neutral was bidden to collect the factions for the return home
there was a general sense of groping and bewilderment
pan had been amongst themnot the great god pan who has been buried these two thousand years but the little god pan who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics
mr beebe had lost everyone and had consumed in solitude the teabasket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise
miss lavish had lost miss bartlett
lucy had lost mr
eager
mr emerson had lost george
miss bartlett had lost a mackintosh square
phaethon had lost the game
that last fact was undeniable
he climbed on to the box shivering with his collar up prophesying the swift approach of bad weather
let us go immediately he told them
the signorino will walk  all the way
he will be hours said mr beebe
apparently
i told him it was unwise he would look no one in the face perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him
he alone had played skilfully using the whole of his instinct while the others had used scraps of their intelligence
he alone had divined what things were and what he wished them to be
he alone had interpreted the message that lucy had received five days before from the lips of a dying man
persephone who spends half her life in the graveshe could interpret it also
not so these english
they gain knowledge slowly and perhaps too late
the thoughts of a cabdriver however just seldom affect the lives of his employers
he was the most competent of miss bartletts opponents but infinitely the least dangerous
once back in the town he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble english ladies no more
of course it was most unpleasant she had seen his black head in the bushes he might make a tavern story out of it
but after all what have we to do with taverns
real menace belongs to the drawingroom
it was of drawingroom people that miss bartlett thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun
lucy sat beside her mr
eager sat opposite trying to catch her eye he was vaguely suspicious
they spoke of alessio baldovinetti
rain and darkness came on together
the two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol
there was a lightning flash and miss lavish who was nervous screamed from the carriage in front
at the next flash lucy screamed also
mr
eager addressed her professionally  courage miss honeychurch courage and faith
if i might say so there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements
are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds all this immense electrical display is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me  noof course  even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous
the steel knives the only articles which might attract the current are in the other carriage
and in any case we are infinitely safer than if we were walking
couragecourage and faith  under the rug lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousins hand
at times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards
miss bartlett by this timely exercise of her muscles gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination
she renewed it when the two carriages stopped half into florence
mr
eager called mr beebe
we want your assistance
will you interpret for us  george cried mr emerson
ask your driver which way george went
the boy may lose his way
he may be killed  go mr eager said miss bartlett dont ask our driver our driver is no help
go and support poor mr beebe he is nearly demented  he may be killed cried the old man
he may be killed  typical behaviour said the chaplain as he quitted the carriage
in the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down  what does he know whispered lucy as soon as they were alone
charlotte how much does mr
eager know  nothing dearest he knows nothing
but she pointed at the driverhe knows everything
dearest had we better
shall i she took out her purse
it is dreadful to be entangled with lowclass people
he saw it all tapping phaethons back with her guidebook she said silenzio and offered him a franc
va bene he replied and accepted it
as well this ending to his day as any
but lucy a mortal maid was disappointed in him
there was an explosion up the road
the storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline and one of the great supports had fallen
if they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt
they chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation and the floods of love and sincerity which fructify every hour of life burst forth in tumult
they descended from the carriages they embraced each other
it was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them
for a moment they realized vast possibilities of good
the older people recovered quickly
in the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike
miss lavish calculated that even if they had continued they would not have been caught in the accident
mr
eager mumbled a temperate prayer
but the drivers through miles of dark squalid road poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints and lucy poured out hers to her cousin
charlotte dear charlotte kiss me
kiss me again
only you can understand me
you warned me to be careful
and ii thought i was developing  do not cry dearest
take your time  i have been obstinate and sillyworse than you know far worse
once by the riveroh but he isnt killedhe wouldnt be killed would he  the thought disturbed her repentance
as a matter of fact the storm was worst along the road but she had been near danger and so she thought it must be near to everyone
i trust not
one would always pray against that  he is reallyi think he was taken by surprise just as i was before
but this time im not to blame i want you to believe that
i simply slipped into those violets
no i want to be really truthful
i am a little to blame
i had silly thoughts
the sky you know was gold and the ground all blue and for a moment he looked like someone in a book  in a book  heroesgodsthe nonsense of schoolgirls  and then  but charlotte you know what happened then  miss bartlett was silent
indeed she had little more to learn
with a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her
all the way back lucys body was shaken by deep sighs which nothing could repress
i want to be truthful she whispered
it is so hard to be absolutely truthful  dont be troubled dearest
wait till you are calmer
we will talk it over before bedtime in my room  so they reentered the city with hands clasped
it was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others
the storm had ceased and mr emerson was easier about his son
mr beebe had regained good humour and mr
eager was already snubbing miss lavish
charlotte alone she was sure ofcharlotte whose exterior concealed so much insight and love
the luxury of selfexposure kept her almost happy through the long evening
she thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it
all her sensations her spasms of courage her moments of unreasonable joy her mysterious discontent should be carefully laid before her cousin
and together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all
at last thought she i shall understand myself
i shant again be troubled by things that come out of nothing and mean i dont know what  miss alan asked her to play
she refused vehemently
music seemed to her the employment of a child
she sat close to her cousin who with commendable patience was listening to a long story about lost luggage
when it was over she capped it by a story of her own
lucy became rather hysterical with the delay
in vain she tried to check or at all events to accelerate the tale
it was not till a late hour that miss bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach  well dear i at all events am ready for bedfordshire
come into my room and i will give a good brush to your hair  with some solemnity the door was shut and a cane chair placed for the girl
then miss bartlett said so what is to be done  she was unprepared for the question
it had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything
a detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon
what is to be done
a point dearest which you alone can settle  the rain was streaming down the black windows and the great room felt damp and chilly one candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to miss bartletts toque which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door
a tram roared by in the dark and lucy felt unaccountably sad though she had long since dried her eyes
she lifted them to the ceiling where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague the very ghosts of joy
it has been raining for nearly four hours she said at last
miss bartlett ignored the remark
how do you propose to silence him  the driver  my dear girl no mr george emerson  lucy began to pace up and down the room
i dont understand she said at last
she understood very well but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful
how are you going to stop him talking about it  i have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do  i too intend to judge him charitably
but unfortunately i have met the type before
they seldom keep their exploits to themselves  exploits cried lucy wincing under the horrible plural
my poor dear did you suppose that this was his first
come here and listen to me
i am only gathering it from his own remarks
do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with miss alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another  yes said lucy whom at the time the argument had pleased
well i am no prude
there is no need to call him a wicked young man but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined
let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education if you wish
but we are no farther on with our question
what do you propose to do  an idea rushed across lucys brain which had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her might have proved victorious
i propose to speak to him said she
miss bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm
you see charlotte your kindnessi shall never forget it
butas you saidit is my affair
mine and his  and you are going to implore him to beg him to keep silence  certainly not
there would be no difficulty
whatever you ask him he answers yes or no then it is over
i have been frightened of him
but now i am not one little bit  but we fear him for you dear
you are so young and inexperienced you have lived among such nice people that you cannot realize what men can behow they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round
this afternoon for example if i had not arrived what would have happened  i cant think said lucy gravely
something in her voice made miss bartlett repeat her question intoning it more vigorously
what would have happened if i hadnt arrived  i cant think said lucy again
when he insulted you how would you have replied  i hadnt time to think
you came  yes but wont you tell me now what you would have done  i should have she checked herself and broke the sentence off
she went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness
she could not think what she would have done
come away from the window dear said miss bartlett
you will be seen from the road  lucy obeyed
she was in her cousins power
she could not modulate out the key of selfabasement in which she had started
neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to george and settle the matter whatever it was with him
miss bartlett became plaintive
oh for a real man
we are only two women you and i mr beebe is hopeless
there is mr
eager but you do not trust him
oh for your brother
he is young but i know that his sisters insult would rouse in him a very lion
thank god chivalry is not yet dead
there are still left some men who can reverence woman  as she spoke she pulled off her rings of which she wore several and ranged them upon the pin cushion
then she blew into her gloves and said  it will be a push to catch the morning train but we must try  what train  the train to rome she looked at her gloves critically
the girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given
when does the train to rome go  at eight  signora bertolini would be upset  we must face that said miss bartlett not liking to say that she had given notice already
she will make us pay for a whole weeks pension  i expect she will
however we shall be much more comfortable at the vyses hotel
isnt afternoon tea given there for nothing  yes but they pay extra for wine after this remark she remained motionless and silent
to her tired eyes charlotte throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream
they began to sort their clothes for packing for there was no time to lose if they were to catch the train to rome
lucy when admonished began to move to and fro between the rooms more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill charlotte who was practical without ability knelt by the side of an empty trunk vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size
she gave two or three sighs for the stooping posture hurt her back and for all her diplomacy she felt that she was growing old
the girl heard her as she entered the room and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause
she only felt that the candle would burn better the packing go easier the world be happier if she could give and receive some human love
the impulse had come before today but never so strongly
she knelt down by her cousins side and took her in her arms
miss bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth
but she was not a stupid woman and she knew perfectly well that lucy did not love her but needed her to love
for it was in ominous tones that she said after a long pause  dearest lucy how will you ever forgive me  lucy was on her guard at once knowing by bitter experience what forgiving miss bartlett meant
her emotion relaxed she modified her embrace a little and she said  charlotte dear what do you mean
as if i have anything to forgive  you have a great deal and i have a very great deal to forgive myself too
i know well how much i vex you at every turn  but no  miss bartlett assumed her favourite role that of the prematurely aged martyr
ah but yes
i feel that our tour together is hardly the success i had hoped
i might have known it would not do
you want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you
i am too uninteresting and oldfashionedonly fit to pack and unpack your things  please  my only consolation was that you found people more to your taste and were often able to leave me at home
i had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do but i hope i did not inflict them on you more than was necessary
you had your own way about these rooms at all events  you mustnt say these things said lucy softly
she still clung to the hope that she and charlotte loved each other heart and soul
they continued to pack in silence
i have been a failure said miss bartlett as she struggled with the straps of lucys trunk instead of strapping her own
failed to make you happy failed in my duty to your mother
she has been so generous to me i shall never face her again after this disaster  but mother will understand
it is not your fault this trouble and it isnt a disaster either  it is my fault it is a disaster
she will never forgive me and rightly
for instance what right had i to make friends with miss lavish  every right  when i was here for your sake
if i have vexed you it is equally true that i have neglected you
your mother will see this as clearly as i do when you tell her  lucy from a cowardly wish to improve the situation said  why need mother hear of it  but you tell her everything  i suppose i do generally  i dare not break your confidence
there is something sacred in it
unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her  the girl would not be degraded to this
naturally i should have told her
but in case she should blame you in any way i promise i will not i am very willing not to
i will never speak of it either to her or to any one  her promise brought the longdrawn interview to a sudden close
miss bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks wished her goodnight and sent her to her own room
for a moment the original trouble was in the background
george would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually
at present she neither acquitted nor condemned him she did not pass judgement
at the moment when she was about to judge him her cousins voice had intervened and ever since it was miss bartlett who had dominated miss bartlett who even now could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall miss bartlett who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent
she had worked like a great artist for a timeindeed for yearsshe had been meaningless but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn bettera shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil but which do not seem to bring good if we may judge from those who have used them most
lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity of her craving for sympathy and love
such a wrong is not easily forgotten
never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff
and such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul
the doorbell rang and she started to the shutters
before she reached them she hesitated turned and blew out the candle
thus it was that though she saw someone standing in the wet below he though he looked up did not see her
to reach his room he had to go by hers
she was still dressed
it struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up and that their extraordinary intercourse was over
whether she would have dared to do this was never proved
at the critical moment miss bartlett opened her own door and her voice said  i wish one word with you in the drawingroom mr emerson please  soon their footsteps returned and miss bartlett said goodnight mr emerson  his heavy tired breathing was the only reply the chaperon had done her work
lucy cried aloud it isnt true
it cant all be true
i want not to be muddled
i want to grow older quickly  miss bartlett tapped on the wall
go to bed at once dear
you need all the rest you can get  in the morning they left for rome
part two     chapter viii medieval   the drawingroom curtains at windy corner had been pulled to meet for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the august sun
they were heavy curtains reaching almost to the ground and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied
a poetnone was presentmight have quoted life like a dome of many coloured glass or might have compared the curtains to sluicegates lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven
without was poured a sea of radiance within the glory though visible was tempered to the capacities of man
two pleasant people sat in the room
onea boy of nineteenwas studying a small manual of anatomy and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano
from time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned for the day was hot and the print small and the human frame fearfully made and his mother who was writing a letter did continually read out to him what she had written
and continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet and make the remark that they were still there
where arent they said the boy who was freddy lucys brother
i tell you im getting fairly sick  for goodness sake go out of my drawingroom then cried mrs honeychurch who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally
freddy did not move or reply
i think things are coming to a head she observed rather wanting her sons opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication
time they did  i am glad that cecil is asking her this once more  its his third go isnt it  freddy i do call the way you talk unkind  i didnt mean to be unkind then he added but i do think lucy might have got this off her chest in italy
i dont know how girls manage things but she cant have said no properly before or she wouldnt have to say it again now
over the whole thingi cant explaini do feel so uncomfortable  do you indeed dear
how interesting  i feelnever mind  he returned to his work
just listen to what i have written to mrs vyse
i said dear mrs vyse  yes mother you told me
a jolly good letter  i said dear mrs vyse cecil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it
but she stopped reading i was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all
he has always gone in for unconventionality and parents nowhere and so forth
when it comes to the point he cant get on without me  nor me  you  freddy nodded
what do you mean  he asked me for my permission also  she exclaimed how very odd of him  why so asked the son and heir
why shouldnt my permission be asked  what do you know about lucy or girls or anything
what ever did you say  i said to cecil take her or leave her its no business of mine  what a helpful answer but her own answer though more normal in its wording had been to the same effect
the bother is this began freddy
then he took up his work again too shy to say what the bother was
mrs honeychurch went back to the window
freddy you must come
there they still are  i dont see you ought to go peeping like that  peeping like that
cant i look out of my own window  but she returned to the writingtable observing as she passed her son still page  freddy snorted and turned over two leaves
for a brief space they were silent
close by beyond the curtains the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased
the bother is this i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully he gave a nervous gulp
not content with permission which i did givethat is to say i said i dont mindwell not content with that he wanted to know whether i wasnt off my head with joy
he practically put it like this wasnt it a splendid thing for lucy and for windy corner generally if he married her
and he would have an answerhe said it would strengthen his hand  i hope you gave a careful answer dear  i answered no said the boy grinding his teeth
there
fly into a stew
i cant help ithad to say it
i had to say no
he ought never to have asked me  ridiculous child cried his mother
you think youre so holy and truthful but really its only abominable conceit
do you suppose that a man like cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say
i hope he boxed your ears
how dare you say no  oh do keep quiet mother
i had to say no when i couldnt say yes
i tried to laugh as if i didnt mean what i said and as cecil laughed too and went away it may be all right
but i feel my foots in it
oh do keep quiet though and let a man do some work  no said mrs honeychurch with the air of one who has considered the subject i shall not keep quiet
you know all that has passed between them in rome you know why he is down here and yet you deliberately insult him and try to turn him out of my house  not a bit he pleaded
i only let out i didnt like him
i dont hate him but i dont like him
what i mind is that hell tell lucy  he glanced at the curtains dismally
well i like him said mrs honeychurch
i know his mother hes good hes clever hes rich hes well connectedoh you neednt kick the piano
hes well connectedill say it again if you like hes well connected she paused as if rehearsing her eulogy but her face remained dissatisfied
she added and he has beautiful manners  i liked him till just now
i suppose its having him spoiling lucys first week at home and its also something that mr beebe said not knowing  mr
beebe said his mother trying to conceal her interest
i dont see how mr beebe comes in  you know mr beebes funny way when you never quite know what he means
he said mr
vyse is an ideal bachelor i was very cute i asked him what he meant
he said oh hes like mebetter detached i couldnt make him say any more but it set me thinking
since cecil has come after lucy he hasnt been so pleasant at leasti cant explain  you never can dear
but i can
you are jealous of cecil because he may stop lucy knitting you silk ties  the explanation seemed plausible and freddy tried to accept it
but at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust
cecil praised one too much for being athletic
was that it
cecil made one talk in ones own way
this tired one
was that it
and cecil was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellows cap
unaware of his own profundity freddy checked himself
he must be jealous or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons
will this do called his mother
dear mrs vysececil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it then i put in at the top and i have told lucy so i must write the letter out againand i have told lucy so
but lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves i said that because i didnt want mrs vyse to think us oldfashioned
she goes in for lectures and improving her mind and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds and the maids dirty thumbmarks where you turn on the electric light
she keeps that flat abominably  suppose lucy marries cecil would she live in a flat or in the country  dont interrupt so foolishly
where was i
oh yesyoung people must decide for themselves
i know that lucy likes your son because she tells me everything and she wrote to me from rome when he asked her first no ill cross that last bit outit looks patronizing
ill stop at because she tells me everything or shall i cross that out too  cross it out too said freddy
mrs honeychurch left it in
then the whole thing runs dear mrs vysececil has just asked my permission about it and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it and i have told lucy so
but lucy seems very uncertain and in these days young people must decide for themselves
i know that lucy likes your son because she tells me everything
but i do not know  look out cried freddy
the curtains parted
cecils first movement was one of irritation
he couldnt bear the honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture
instinctively he give the curtains a twitch and sent them swinging down their poles
light entered
there was revealed a terrace such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it and on it a little rustic seat and two flowerbeds
but it was transfigured by the view beyond for windy corner was built on the range that overlooks the sussex weald
lucy who was in the little seat seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world
cecil entered
appearing thus late in the story cecil must be at once described
he was medieval
like a gothic statue
tall and refined with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a french cathedral
well educated well endowed and not deficient physically he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as selfconsciousness and whom the medieval with dimmer vision worshipped as asceticism
a gothic statue implies celibacy just as a greek statue implies fruition and perhaps this was what mr beebe meant
and freddy who ignored history and art perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine cecil wearing another fellows cap
mrs honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance
oh cecil she exclaimedoh cecil do tell me  i promessi sposi said he
they stared at him anxiously
she has accepted me he said and the sound of the thing in english made him flush and smile with pleasure and look more human
i am so glad said mrs honeychurch while freddy proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals
they wished that they also knew italian for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones
we are obliged to become vaguely poetic or to take refuge in scriptural reminiscences
welcome as one of the family said mrs honeychurch waving her hand at the furniture
this is indeed a joyous day
i feel sure that you will make our dear lucy happy  i hope so replied the young man shifting his eyes to the ceiling
we mothers simpered mrs honeychurch and then realized that she was affected sentimental bombasticall the things she hated most
why could she not be freddy who stood stiff in the middle of the room looking very cross and almost handsome
i say lucy called cecil for conversation seemed to flag
lucy rose from the seat
she moved across the lawn and smiled in at them just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis
then she saw her brothers face
her lips parted and she took him in her arms
he said steady on  not a kiss for me asked her mother
lucy kissed her also
would you take them into the garden and tell mrs honeychurch all about it cecil suggested
and id stop here and tell my mother  we go with lucy said freddy as if taking orders
yes you go with lucy  they passed into the sunlight
cecil watched them cross the terrace and descend out of sight by the steps
they would descendhe knew their wayspast the shrubbery and past the tennislawn and the dahliabed until they reached the kitchen garden and there in the presence of the potatoes and the peas the great event would be discussed
smiling indulgently he lit a cigarette and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion
he had known lucy for several years but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical
he could still remember his depression that afternoon at rome when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue and demanded to be taken to st peters
that day she had seemed a typical touristshrill crude and gaunt with travel
but italy worked some marvel in her
it gave her light andwhich he held more preciousit gave her shadow
soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence
she was like a woman of leonardo da vincis whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us
the things are assuredly not of this life no woman of leonardos could have anything so vulgar as a story she did develop most wonderfully day by day
so it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion at least to a profound uneasiness
already at rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other
it had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion
her refusal had been clear and gentle after itas the horrid phrase wentshe had been exactly the same to him as before
three months later on the margin of italy among the flowerclad alps he had asked her again in bald traditional language
she reminded him of a leonardo more than ever her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her
he walked home with her unashamed feeling not at all like a rejected suitor
the things that really mattered were unshaken
so now he had asked her once more and clear and gentle as ever she had accepted him giving no coy reasons for her delay but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy
his mother too would be pleased she had counselled the step he must write her a long account
glancing at his hand in case any of freddys chemicals had come off on it he moved to the writing table
there he saw dear mrs vyse followed by many erasures
he recoiled without reading any more and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere and pencilled a note on his knee
then he lit another cigarette which did not seem quite as divine as the first and considered what might be done to make windy corner drawingroom more distinctive
with that outlook it should have been a successful room but the trail of tottenham court road was upon it he could almost visualize the motorvans of messrs shoolbred and messrs
maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair those varnished bookcases that writingtable
the table recalled mrs honeychurchs letter
he did not want to read that letterhis temptations never lay in that direction but he worried about it none the less
it was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win lucy he wanted to feel that others no matter who they were agreed with him and so he had asked their permission
mrs honeychurch had been civil but obtuse in essentials while as for freddyhe is only a boy he reflected
i represent all that he despises
why should he want me for a brotherinlaw  the honeychurches were a worthy family but he began to realize that lucy was of another clay and perhapshe did not put it very definitelyhe ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible
mr
beebe said the maid and the new rector of summer street was shown in he had at once started on friendly relations owing to lucys praise of him in her letters from florence
cecil greeted him rather critically
ive come for tea mr vyse
do you suppose that i shall get it  i should say so
food is the thing one does get heredont sit in that chair young honeychurch has left a bone in it  pfui  i know said cecil
i know
i cant think why mrs honeychurch allows it  for cecil considered the bone and the maples furniture separately he did not realize that taken together they kindled the room into the life that he desired
ive come for tea and for gossip
isnt this news  news
i dont understand you said cecil
news  mr beebe whose news was of a very different nature prattled forward
i met sir harry otway as i came up i have every reason to hope that i am first in the field
he has bought cissie and albert from mr flack  has he indeed said cecil trying to recover himself
into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen
was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant
but his stiffness remained and though he asked who cissie and albert might be he still thought mr beebe rather a bounder
unpardonable question
to have stopped a week at windy corner and not to have met cissie and albert the semidetached villas that have been run up opposite the church
ill set mrs honeychurch after you  im shockingly stupid over local affairs said the young man languidly
i cant even remember the difference between a parish council and a local government board
perhaps there is no difference or perhaps those arent the right names
i only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery
it is very remiss of me
italy and london are the only places where i dont feel to exist on sufferance  mr beebe distressed at this heavy reception of cissie and albert determined to shift the subject
let me see mr vysei forgetwhat is your profession  i have no profession said cecil
it is another example of my decadence
my attitudequite an indefensible oneis that so long as i am no trouble to any one i have a right to do as i like
i know i ought to be getting money out of people or devoting myself to things i dont care a straw about but somehow ive not been able to begin  you are very fortunate said mr beebe
it is a wonderful opportunity the possession of leisure  his voice was rather parochial but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally
he felt as all who have regular occupation must feel that others should have it also
i am glad that you approve
i darent face the healthy personfor example freddy honeychurch  oh freddys a good sort isnt he  admirable
the sort who has made england what she is  cecil wondered at himself
why on this day of all others was he so hopelessly contrary
he tried to get right by inquiring effusively after mr beebes mother an old lady for whom he had no particular regard
then he flattered the clergyman praised his liberalmindedness his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science
where are the others said mr beebe at last i insist on extracting tea before evening service  i suppose anne never told them you were here
in this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives
the fault of anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly and kicks the chairlegs with her feet
the faults of maryi forget the faults of mary but they are very grave
shall we look in the garden  i know the faults of mary
she leaves the dustpans standing on the stairs  the fault of euphemia is that she will not simply will not chop the suet sufficiently small  they both laughed and things began to go better
the faults of freddy cecil continued
ah he has too many
no one but his mother can remember the faults of freddy
try the faults of miss honeychurch they are not innumerable  she has none said the young man with grave sincerity
i quite agree
at present she has none  at present  im not cynical
im only thinking of my pet theory about miss honeychurch
does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully and live so quietly
i suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both
the watertight compartments in her will break down and music and life will mingle
then we shall have her heroically good heroically badtoo heroic perhaps to be good or bad  cecil found his companion interesting
and at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes  well i must say ive only seen her at tunbridge wells where she was not wonderful and at florence
since i came to summer street she has been away
you saw her didnt you at rome and in the alps
oh i forgot of course you knew her before
no she wasnt wonderful in florence either but i kept on expecting that she would be  in what way  conversation had become agreeable to them and they were pacing up and down the terrace
i could as easily tell you what tune shell play next
there was simply the sense that she had found wings and meant to use them
i can show you a beautiful picture in my italian diary miss honeychurch as a kite miss bartlett holding the string
picture number two the string breaks  the sketch was in his diary but it had been made afterwards when he viewed things artistically
at the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself
but the string never broke  no
i mightnt have seen miss honeychurch rise but i should certainly have heard miss bartlett fall  it has broken now said the young man in low vibrating tones
immediately he realized that of all the conceited ludicrous contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst
he cursed his love of metaphor had he suggested that he was a star and that lucy was soaring up to reach him
broken
what do you mean  i meant said cecil stiffly that she is going to marry me  the clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice
i am sorry i must apologize
i had no idea you were intimate with her or i should never have talked in this flippant superficial way
mr vyse you ought to have stopped me and down the garden he saw lucy herself yes he was disappointed
cecil who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies drew down his mouth at the corners
was this the reception his action would get from the world
of course he despised the world as a whole every thoughtful man should it is almost a test of refinement
but he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered
occasionally he could be quite crude
i am sorry i have given you a shock he said dryly
i fear that lucys choice does not meet with your approval  not that
but you ought to have stopped me
i know miss honeychurch only a little as time goes
perhaps i oughtnt to have discussed her so freely with any one certainly not with you  you are conscious of having said something indiscreet  mr beebe pulled himself together
really mr vyse had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions
he was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession
no i have said nothing indiscreet
i foresaw at florence that her quiet uneventful childhood must end and it has ended
i realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step
she has taken it
she has learntyou will let me talk freely as i have begun freelyshe has learnt what it is to love the greatest lesson some people will tell you that our earthly life provides it was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio
he did not omit to do so
she has learnt through you and if his voice was still clerical it was now also sincere let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her  grazie tante said cecil who did not like parsons
have you heard shouted mrs honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping garden
oh mr beebe have you heard the news  freddy now full of geniality whistled the wedding march
youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact
indeed i have he cried
he looked at lucy
in her presence he could not act the parson any longerat all events not without apology
mrs
honeychurch im going to do what i am always supposed to do but generally im too shy
i want to invoke every kind of blessing on them grave and gay great and small
i want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife as father and mother
and now i want my tea  you only asked for it just in time the lady retorted
how dare you be serious at windy corner  he took his tone from her
there was no more heavy beneficence no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the scriptures
none of them dared or was able to be serious any more
an engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe
away from it in the solitude of their rooms mr beebe and even freddy might again be critical
but in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious
it has a strange power for it compels not only the lips but the very heart
the chief parallel to compare one great thing with anotheris the power over us of a temple of some alien creed
standing outside we deride or oppose it or at the most feel sentimental
inside though the saints and gods are not ours we become true believers in case any true believer should be present
so it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant teaparty
if they were hypocrites they did not know it and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true
anne putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present stimulated them greatly
they could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawingroom door
mr beebe chirruped
freddy was at his wittiest referring to cecil as the fiascofamily honoured pun on fiance
mrs honeychurch amusing and portly promised well as a motherinlaw
as for lucy and cecil for whom the temple had been built they also joined in the merry ritual but waited as earnest worshippers should for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy
chapter ix lucy as a work of art   a few days after the engagement was announced mrs honeychurch made lucy and her fiasco come to a little gardenparty in the neighbourhood for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man
cecil was more than presentable he looked distinguished and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with lucy and his long fair face responding when lucy spoke to him
people congratulated mrs honeychurch which is i believe a social blunder but it pleased her and she introduced cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers
at tea a misfortune took place a cup of coffee was upset over lucys figured silk and though lucy feigned indifference her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid
they were gone some time and cecil was left with the dowagers
when they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been
do you go to much of this sort of thing he asked when they were driving home
oh now and then said lucy who had rather enjoyed herself
is it typical of country society  i suppose so
mother would it be  plenty of society said mrs honeychurch who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses
seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere cecil bent towards lucy and said  to me it seemed perfectly appalling disastrous portentous  i am so sorry that you were stranded  not that but the congratulations
it is so disgusting the way an engagement is regarded as public propertya kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment
all those old women smirking  one has to go through it i suppose
they wont notice us so much next time  but my point is that their whole attitude is wrong
an engagementhorrid word in the first placeis a private matter and should be treated as such  yet the smirking old women however wrong individually were racially correct
the spirit of the generations had smiled through them rejoicing in the engagement of cecil and lucy because it promised the continuance of life on earth
to cecil and lucy it promised something quite differentpersonal love
hence cecils irritation and lucys belief that his irritation was just
how tiresome she said
couldnt you have escaped to tennis  i dont play tennisat least not in public
the neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic
such romance as i have is that of the inglese italianato  inglese italianato  e un diavolo incarnato
you know the proverb  she did not
nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in rome with his mother
but cecil since his engagement had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing
well said he i cannot help it if they do disapprove of me
there are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them and i must accept them  we all have our limitations i suppose said wise lucy
sometimes they are forced on us though said cecil who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position
how  it makes a difference doesnt it whether we fully fence ourselves in or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others  she thought a moment and agreed that it did make a difference
difference cried mrs honeychurch suddenly alert
i dont see any difference
fences are fences especially when they are in the same place  we were speaking of motives said cecil on whom the interruption jarred
my dear cecil look here she spread out her knees and perched her cardcase on her lap
this is me
thats windy corner
the rest of the pattern is the other people
motives are all very well but the fence comes here  we werent talking of real fences said lucy laughing
oh i see dearpoetry  she leant placidly back
cecil wondered why lucy had been amused
i tell you who has no fences as you call them she said and thats mr beebe  a parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless  lucy was slow to follow what people said but quick enough to detect what they meant
she missed cecils epigram but grasped the feeling that prompted it
dont you like mr beebe she asked thoughtfully
i never said so he cried
i consider him far above the average
i only denied and he swept off on the subject of fences again and was brilliant
now a clergyman that i do hate said she wanting to say something sympathetic a clergyman that does have fences and the most dreadful ones is mr
eager the english chaplain at florence
he was truly insincerenot merely the manner unfortunate
he was a snob and so conceited and he did say such unkind things  what sort of things  there was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife  perhaps he had  no  why no  he was such a nice old man im sure  cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence
well i did try to sift the thing
mr
eager would never come to the point
he prefers it vaguesaid the old man had practically murdered his wifehad murdered her in the sight of god  hush dear said mrs honeychurch absently
but isnt it intolerable that a person whom were told to imitate should go round spreading slander
it was i believe chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped
people pretended he was vulgar but he certainly wasnt that  poor old man
what was his name  harris said lucy glibly
lets hope that mrs harris there warnt no sich person said her mother
cecil nodded intelligently
isnt mr
eager a parson of the cultured type he asked
i dont know
i hate him
ive heard him lecture on giotto
i hate him
nothing can hide a petty nature
i hate him  my goodness gracious me child said mrs honeychurch
youll blow my head off
whatever is there to shout over
i forbid you and cecil to hate any more clergymen  he smiled
there was indeed something rather incongruous in lucys moral outburst over mr
eager
it was as if one should see the leonardo on the ceiling of the sistine
he longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation that a womans power and charm reside in mystery not in muscular rant
but possibly rant is a sign of vitality it mars the beautiful creature but shows that she is alive
after a moment he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval
he forebore to repress the sources of youth
naturesimplest of topics he thoughtlay around them
he praised the pinewoods the deep lasts of bracken the crimson leaves that spotted the hurtbushes the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road
the outdoor world was not very familiar to him and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact
mrs honeychurchs mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch
i count myself a lucky person he concluded when im in london i feel i could never live out of it
when im in the country i feel the same about the country
after all i do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life and that the people who live amongst them must be the best
its true that in nine cases out of ten they dont seem to notice anything
the country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions
yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of nature which is denied to us of the town
do you feel that mrs honeychurch  mrs honeychurch started and smiled
she had not been attending
cecil who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria felt irritable and determined not to say anything interesting again
lucy had not attended either
her brow was wrinkled and she still looked furiously crossthe result he concluded of too much moral gymnastics
it was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an august wood
come down o maid from yonder mountain height he quoted and touched her knee with his own
she flushed again and said what height  come down o maid from yonder mountain height what pleasure lives in height the shepherd sang
in height and in the splendour of the hills   let us take mrs honeychurchs advice and hate clergymen no more
whats this place  summer street of course said lucy and roused herself
the woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow
pretty cottages lined it on two sides and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church expensively simple a charming shingled spire
mr beebes house was near the church
in height it scarcely exceeded the cottages
some great mansions were at hand but they were hidden in the trees
the scene suggested a swiss alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world and was marred only by two ugly little villasthe villas that had competed with cecils engagement having been acquired by sir harry otway the very afternoon that lucy had been acquired by cecil
cissie was the name of one of these villas albert of the other
these titles were not only picked out in shaded gothic on the garden gates but appeared a second time on the porches where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals
albert was inhabited
his tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells
his little windows were chastely swathed in nottingham lace
cissie was to let
three noticeboards belonging to dorking agents lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact
her paths were already weedy her pockethandkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions
the place is ruined said the ladies mechanically
summer street will never be the same again  as the carriage passed cissies door opened and a gentleman came out of her
stop cried mrs honeychurch touching the coachman with her parasol
heres sir harry
now we shall know
sir harry pull those things down at once  sir harry otwaywho need not be describedcame to the carriage and said mrs
honeychurch i meant to
i cant i really cant turn out miss flack  am i not always right
she ought to have gone before the contract was signed
does she still live rent free as she did in her nephews time  but what can i do he lowered his voice
an old lady so very vulgar and almost bedridden  turn her out said cecil bravely
sir harry sighed and looked at the villas mournfully
he had had full warning of mr flacks intentions and might have bought the plot before building commenced but he was apathetic and dilatory
he had known summer street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt
not till mrs flack had laid the foundation stone and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm
he called on mr flack the local buildera most reasonable and respectful manwho agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof but pointed out that slates were cheaper
he ventured to differ however about the corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows saying that for his part he liked to relieve the faade by a bit of decoration
sir harry hinted that a column if possible should be structural as well as decorative
mr flack replied that all the columns had been ordered adding and all the capitals differentone with dragons in the foliage another approaching to the ionian style another introducing mrs flacks initialsevery one different for he had read his ruskin
he built his villas according to his desire and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did sir harry buy
this futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on mrs honeychurchs carriage
he had failed in his duties to the countryside and the countryside was laughing at him as well
he had spent money and yet summer street was spoilt as much as ever
all he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for cissiesomeone really desirable
the rent is absurdly low he told them and perhaps i am an easy landlord
but it is such an awkward size
it is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves  cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise sir harry for despising them
the latter impulse seemed the more fruitful
you ought to find a tenant at once he said maliciously
it would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk  exactly said sir harry excitedly
that is exactly what i fear mr vyse
it will attract the wrong type of people
the train service has improveda fatal improvement to my mind
and what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles  rather a strenuous clerk it would be said lucy
cecil who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate
she saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour and roused herself to stop him
sir harry she exclaimed i have an idea
how would you like spinsters  my dear lucy it would be splendid
do you know any such  yes i met them abroad  gentlewomen he asked tentatively
yes indeed and at the present moment homeless
i heard from them last weekmiss teresa and miss catharine alan
im really not joking
they are quite the right people
mr beebe knows them too
may i tell them to write to you  indeed you may he cried
here we are with the difficulty solved already
how delightful it is
extra facilitiesplease tell them they shall have extra facilities for i shall have no agents fees
oh the agents
the appalling people they have sent me
one woman when i wrotea tactful letter you knowasking her to explain her social position to me replied that she would pay the rent in advance
as if one cares about that
and several references i took up were most unsatisfactorypeople swindlers or not respectable
and oh the deceit
i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week
the deceit of the most promising people
my dear lucy the deceit  she nodded
my advice put in mrs honeychurch is to have nothing to do with lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all
i know the type
preserve me from people who have seen better days and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy
its a sad thing but id far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down  i think i follow you said sir harry but it is as you say a very sad thing  the misses alan arent that cried lucy
yes they are said cecil
i havent met them but i should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood  dont listen to him sir harryhes tiresome  its i who am tiresome he replied
i oughtnt to come with my troubles to young people
but really i am so worried and lady otway will only say that i cannot be too careful which is quite true but no real help  then may i write to my misses alan  please  but his eye wavered when mrs honeychurch exclaimed  beware
they are certain to have canaries
sir harry beware of canaries they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come
beware of women altogether
only let to a man  really he murmured gallantly though he saw the wisdom of her remark
men dont gossip over teacups
if they get drunk theres an end of themthey lie down comfortably and sleep it off
if theyre vulgar they somehow keep it to themselves
it doesnt spread so
give me a manof course provided hes clean  sir harry blushed
neither he nor cecil enjoyed these open compliments to their sex
even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction
he suggested that mrs honeychurch if she had time should descend from the carriage and inspect cissie for herself
she was delighted
nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house
domestic arrangements always attracted her especially when they were on a small scale
cecil pulled lucy back as she followed her mother
mrs
honeychurch he said what if we two walk home and leave you  certainly was her cordial reply
sir harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them
he beamed at them knowingly said aha
young people young people and then hastened to unlock the house
hopeless vulgarian exclaimed cecil almost before they were out of earshot
oh cecil  i cant help it
it would be wrong not to loathe that man  he isnt clever but really he is nice  no lucy he stands for all that is bad in country life
in london he would keep his place
he would belong to a brainless club and his wife would give brainless dinner parties
but down here he acts the little god with his gentility and his patronage and his sham aesthetics and every oneeven your motheris taken in  all that you say is quite true said lucy though she felt discouraged
i wonder whetherwhether it matters so very much  it matters supremely
sir harry is the essence of that gardenparty
oh goodness how cross i feel
how i do hope hell get some vulgar tenant in that villasome woman so really vulgar that hell notice it
gentlefolks ugh
with his bald head and retreating chin
but lets forget him  this lucy was glad enough to do
if cecil disliked sir harry otway and mr beebe what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape
for instance freddy
freddy was neither clever nor subtle nor beautiful and what prevented cecil from saying any minute it would be wrong not to loathe freddy
and what would she reply
further than freddy she did not go but he gave her anxiety enough
she could only assure herself that cecil had known freddy some time and that they had always got on pleasantly except perhaps during the last few days which was an accident perhaps
which way shall we go she asked him
naturesimplest of topics she thoughtwas around them
summer street lay deep in the woods and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad
are there two ways  perhaps the road is more sensible as were got up smart  id rather go through the wood said cecil with that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon
why is it lucy that you always say the road
do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged  havent i
the wood then said lucy startled at his queerness but pretty sure that he would explain later it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning
she led the way into the whispering pines and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards
i had got an ideai dare say wronglythat you feel more at home with me in a room  a room she echoed hopelessly bewildered
yes
or at the most in a garden or on a road
never in the real country like this  oh cecil whatever do you mean
i have never felt anything of the sort
you talk as if i was a kind of poetess sort of person  i dont know that you arent
i connect you with a viewa certain type of view
why shouldnt you connect me with a room  she reflected a moment and then said laughing  do you know that youre right
i do
i must be a poetess after all
when i think of you its always as in a room
how funny  to her surprise he seemed annoyed
a drawingroom pray
with no view  yes with no view i fancy
why not  id rather he said reproachfully that you connected me with the open air  she said again oh cecil whatever do you mean  as no explanation was forthcoming she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl and led him further into the wood pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees
she had known the wood between summer street and windy corner ever since she could walk alone she had played at losing freddy in it when freddy was a purplefaced baby and though she had been to italy it had lost none of its charm
presently they came to a little clearing among the pinesanother tiny green alp solitary this time and holding in its bosom a shallow pool
she exclaimed the sacred lake  why do you call it that  i cant remember why
i suppose it comes out of some book
its only a puddle now but you see that stream going through it
well a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains and cant get away at once and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful
then freddy used to bathe there
he is very fond of it  and you  he meant are you fond of it but she answered dreamily i bathed here too till i was found out
then there was a row  at another time he might have been shocked for he had depths of prudishness within him
but now
with his momentary cult of the fresh air he was delighted at her admirable simplicity
he looked at her as she stood by the pools edge
she was got up smart as she phrased it and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own but blooms abruptly out of a world of green
who found you out  charlotte she murmured
she was stopping with us
charlottecharlotte  poor girl  she smiled gravely
a certain scheme from which hitherto he had shrunk now appeared practical
lucy  yes i suppose we ought to be going was her reply
lucy i want to ask something of you that i have never asked before  at the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him
what cecil  hitherto nevernot even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me  he became selfconscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed
his courage had gone
yes  up to now i have never kissed you  she was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately
nomore you have she stammered
then i ask youmay i now  of course you may cecil
you might before
i cant run at you you know  at that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities
her reply was inadequate
she gave such a businesslike lift to her veil
as he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil
as he touched her his gold pincenez became dislodged and was flattened between them
such was the embrace
he considered with truth that it had been a failure
passion should believe itself irresistible
it should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature
above all it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way
why could he not do as any labourer or navvynay as any young man behind the counter would have done
he recast the scene
lucy was standing flowerlike by the water he rushed up and took her in his arms she rebuked him permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness
for he believed that women revere men for their manliness
they left the pool in silence after this one salutation
he waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts
at last she spoke and with fitting gravity
emerson was the name not harris  what name  the old mans  what old man  that old man i told you about
the one mr
eager was so unkind to  he could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had
chapter x cecil as a humourist   the society out of which cecil proposed to rescue lucy was perhaps no very splendid affair yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to
her father a prosperous local solicitor had built windy corner as a speculation at the time the district was opening up and falling in love with his own creation had ended by living there himself
soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter
other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others again among the pinetrees behind and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs
most of these houses were larger than windy corner and were filled by people who came not from the district but from london and who mistook the honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy
he was inclined to be frightened but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility
i cannot think what people are doing she would say but it is extremely fortunate for the children she called everywhere her calls were returned with enthusiasm and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their milieu they liked her and it did not seem to matter
when mr honeychurch died he had the satisfactionwhich few honest solicitors despiseof leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable
the best obtainable
certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull and lucy realized this more vividly since her return from italy
hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioningtheir kindly affluence their inexplosive religion their dislike of paperbags orangepeel and broken bottles
a radical out and out she learnt to speak with horror of suburbia
life so far as she troubled to conceive it was a circle of rich pleasant people with identical interests and identical foes
in this circle one thought married and died
outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter just as the london fog tries to enter the pinewoods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills
but in italy where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality as in the sun this conception of life vanished
her senses expanded she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like that social barriers were irremovable doubtless but not particularly high
you jump over them just as you jump into a peasants oliveyard in the apennines and he is glad to see you
she returned with new eyes
so did cecil but italy had quickened cecil not to tolerance but to irritation
he saw that the local society was narrow but instead of saying does that very much matter he rebelled and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad
he did not realize that lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time and that though her eyes saw its defects her heart refused to despise it entirely
nor did he realize a more important pointthat if she was too great for this society she was too great for all society and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her
a rebel she was but not of the kind he understooda rebel who desired not a wider dwellingroom but equality beside the man she loved
for italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessionsher own soul
playing bumblepuppy with minnie beebe niece to the rector and aged thirteenan ancient and most honourable game which consists in striking tennisballs high into the air so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce some hit mrs honeychurch others are lost
the sentence is confused but the better illustrates lucys state of mind for she was trying to talk to mr beebe at the same time
oh it has been such a nuisancefirst he then theyno one knowing what they wanted and everyone so tiresome  but they really are coming now said mr beebe
i wrote to miss teresa a few days agoshe was wondering how often the butcher called and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably
they are coming
i heard from them this morning
i shall hate those miss alans mrs honeychurch cried
just because theyre old and silly ones expected to say how sweet i hate their ifing and buting and anding
and poor lucyserve her rightworn to a shadow  mr beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tenniscourt
cecil was absentone did not play bumblepuppy when he was there
well if they are comingno minnie not saturn saturn was a tennisball whose skin was partially unsewn
when in motion his orb was encircled by a ring
if they are coming sir harry will let them move in before the twentyninth and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings because it made them nervous and put in the fair wear and tear onethat doesnt count
i told you not saturn  saturns all right for bumblepuppy cried freddy joining them
minnie dont you listen to her  saturn doesnt bounce  saturn bounces enough  no he doesnt  well he bounces better than the beautiful white devil  hush dear said mrs honeychurch
but look at lucycomplaining of saturn and all the times got the beautiful white devil in her hand ready to plug it in
thats right minnie go for herget her over the shins with the racquetget her over the shins  lucy fell the beautiful white devil rolled from her hand
mr beebe picked it up and said the name of this ball is vittoria corombona please but his correction passed unheeded
freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury and in half a minute he had transformed minnie from a wellmannered child into a howling wilderness
up in the house cecil heard them and though he was full of entertaining news he did not come down to impart it in case he got hurt
he was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man
but he hated the physical violence of the young
how right it was
sure enough it ended in a cry
i wish the miss alans could see this observed mr beebe just as lucy who was nursing the injured minnie was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother
who are the miss alans freddy panted
they have taken cissie villa  that wasnt the name  here his foot slipped and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass
an interval elapses
wasnt what name asked lucy with her brothers head in her lap
alan wasnt the name of the people sir harrys let to  nonsense freddy
you know nothing about it  nonsense yourself
ive this minute seen him
he said to me ahem
honeychurchfreddy was an indifferent mimicahem
ahem
i have at last procured really deesirerebel tenants i said ooray old boy and slapped him on the back  exactly
the miss alans  rather not
more like anderson  oh good gracious there isnt going to be another muddle mrs honeychurch exclaimed
do you notice lucy im always right
i said dont interfere with cissie villa
im always right
im quite uneasy at being always right so often  its only another muddle of freddys
freddy doesnt even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead  yes i do
ive got it
emerson  what name  emerson
ill bet you anything you like  what a weathercock sir harry is said lucy quietly
i wish i had never bothered over it at all  then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky
mr beebe whose opinion of her rose daily whispered to his niece that that was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong
meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted mrs honeychurch from the contemplation of her own abilities
emerson freddy
do you know what emersons they are  i dont know whether theyre any emersons retorted freddy who was democratic
like his sister and like most young people he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of emersons annoyed him beyond measure
i trust they are the right sort of person
all right lucyshe was sitting up againi see you looking down your nose and thinking your mothers a snob
but there is a right sort and a wrong sort and its affectation to pretend there isnt  emersons a common enough name lucy remarked
she was gazing sideways
seated on a promontory herself she could see the pineclad promontories descending one beyond another into the weald
the further one descended the garden the more glorious was this lateral view
i was merely going to remark freddy that i trusted they were no relations of emerson the philosopher a most trying man
pray does that satisfy you  oh yes he grumbled
and you will be satisfied too for theyre friends of cecil soelaborate ironyyou and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety  cecil exclaimed lucy
dont be rude dear said his mother placidly
lucy dont screech
its a new bad habit youre getting into  but has cecil  friends of cecils he repeated and so really deesirerebel
ahem
honeychurch i have just telegraphed to them  she got up from the grass
it was hard on lucy
mr beebe sympathized with her very much
while she believed that her snub about the miss alans came from sir harry otway she had borne it like a good girl
she might well screech when she heard that it came partly from her lover
mr vyse was a teasesomething worse than a tease he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people
the clergyman knowing this looked at miss honeychurch with more than his usual kindness
when she exclaimed but cecils emersonsthey cant possibly be the same onesthere is that he did not consider that the exclamation was strange but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure
he diverted it as follows  the emersons who were at florence do you mean
no i dont suppose it will prove to be them
it is probably a long cry from them to friends of mr vyses
oh mrs honeychurch the oddest people
the queerest people
for our part we liked them didnt we he appealed to lucy
there was a great scene over some violets
they picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very miss alans who have failed to come to cissie villa
poor little ladies
so shocked and so pleased
it used to be one of miss catharines great stories
my dear sister loves flowers it began
they found the whole room a mass of bluevases and jugsand the story ends with so ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful it is all very difficult
yes i always connect those florentine emersons with violets  fiascos done you this time remarked freddy not seeing that his sisters face was very red
she could not recover herself
mr beebe saw it and continued to divert the conversation
these particular emersons consisted of a father and a sonthe son a goodly if not a good young man not a fool i fancy but very immaturepessimism et cetera
our special joy was the fathersuch a sentimental darling and people declared he had murdered his wife  in his normal state mr beebe would never have repeated such gossip but he was trying to shelter lucy in her little trouble
he repeated any rubbish that came into his head
murdered his wife said mrs honeychurch
lucy dont desert usgo on playing bumblepuppy
really the pension bertolini must have been the oddest place
thats the second murderer ive heard of as being there
whatever was charlotte doing to stop
bytheby we really must ask charlotte here some time  mr beebe could recall no second murderer
he suggested that his hostess was mistaken
at the hint of opposition she warmed
she was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told
the name escaped her
what was the name
oh what was the name
she clasped her knees for the name
something in thackeray
she struck her matronly forehead
lucy asked her brother whether cecil was in
oh dont go he cried and tried to catch her by the ankles
i must go she said gravely
dont be silly
you always overdo it when you play  as she left them her mothers shout of harris shivered the tranquil air and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right
such a senseless lie too yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these emersons friends of cecils with a pair of nondescript tourists
hitherto truth had come to her naturally
she saw that for the future she must be more vigilant and beabsolutely truthful
well at all events she must not tell lies
she hurried up the garden still flushed with shame
a word from cecil would soothe her she was sure
cecil  hullo he called and leant out of the smokingroom window
he seemed in high spirits
i was hoping youd come
i heard you all beargardening but theres better fun up here
i even i have won a great victory for the comic muse
george merediths rightthe cause of comedy and the cause of truth are really the same and i even i have found tenants for the distressful cissie villa
dont be angry
dont be angry
youll forgive me when you hear it all  he looked very attractive when his face was bright and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once
i have heard she said
freddy has told us
naughty cecil
i suppose i must forgive you
just think of all the trouble i took for nothing
certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome and id rather have nice friends of yours
but you oughtnt to tease one so  friends of mine he laughed
but lucy the whole joke is to come
come here but she remained standing where she was
do you know where i met these desirable tenants
in the national gallery when i was up to see my mother last week  what an odd place to meet people she said nervously
i dont quite understand  in the umbrian room
absolute strangers
they were admiring luca signorelliof course quite stupidly
however we got talking and they refreshed me not a little
they had been to italy  but cecil proceeded hilariously
in the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottagethe father to live there the son to run down for weekends
i thought what a chance of scoring off sir harry and i took their address and a london reference found they werent actual blackguardsit was great sportand wrote to him making out  cecil
no its not fair
ive probably met them before  he bore her down
perfectly fair
anything is fair that punishes a snob
that old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good
sir harry is too disgusting with his decayed gentlewomen i meant to read him a lesson some time
no lucy the classes ought to mix and before long youll agree with me
there ought to be intermarriageall sorts of things
i believe in democracy  no you dont she snapped
you dont know what the word means  he stared at her and felt again that she had failed to be leonardesque
no you dont  her face was inartisticthat of a peevish virago
it isnt fair cecil
i blame youi blame you very much indeed
you had no business to undo my work about the miss alans and make me look ridiculous
you call it scoring off sir harry but do you realize that it is all at my expense
i consider it most disloyal of you  she left him
temper he thought raising his eyebrows
no it was worse than tempersnobbishness
as long as lucy thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the miss alans she had not minded
he perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally
he would tolerate the father and draw out the son who was silent
in the interests of the comic muse and of truth he would bring them to windy corner
chapter xi in mrs vyses wellappointed flat   the comic muse though able to look after her own interests did not disdain the assistance of mr vyse
his idea of bringing the emersons to windy corner struck her as decidedly good and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch
sir harry otway signed the agreement met mr emerson who was duly disillusioned
the miss alans were duly offended and wrote a dignified letter to lucy whom they held responsible for the failure
mr beebe planned pleasant moments for the newcomers and told mrs honeychurch that freddy must call on them as soon as they arrived
indeed so ample was the muses equipment that she permitted mr harris never a very robust criminal to droop his head to be forgotten and to die
lucyto descend from bright heaven to earth whereon there are shadows because there are hillslucy was at first plunged into despair but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least
now that she was engaged the emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood
and cecil was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood
therefore cecil was welcome to bring the emersons into the neighbourhood
but as i say this took a little thinking andso illogical are girlsthe event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done
she was glad that a visit to mrs vyse now fell due the tenants moved into cissie villa while she was safe in the london flat
cecilcecil darling she whispered the evening she arrived and crept into his arms
cecil too became demonstrative
he saw that the needful fire had been kindled in lucy
at last she longed for attention as a woman should and looked up to him because he was a man
so you do love me little thing he murmured
oh cecil i do i do
i dont know what i should do without you  several days passed
then she had a letter from miss bartlett
a coolness had sprung up between the two cousins and they had not corresponded since they parted in august
the coolness dated from what charlotte would call the flight to rome and in rome it had increased amazingly
for the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical
charlotte unselfish in the forum would have tried a sweeter temper than lucys and once in the baths of caracalla they had doubted whether they could continue their tour
lucy had said she would join the vysesmrs
vyse was an acquaintance of her mother so there was no impropriety in the plan and miss bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly
finally nothing happened but the coolness remained and for lucy was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows
it had been forwarded from windy corner
tunbridge wells september
dearest lucia   i have news of you at last
miss lavish has been bicycling in your parts but was not sure whether a call would be welcome
puncturing her tire near summer street and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard she saw to her astonishment a door open opposite and the younger emerson man come out
he said his father had just taken the house
he said he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood 
he never suggested giving eleanor a cup of tea
dear lucy i am much worried and i advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother freddy and mr vyse who will forbid him to enter the house etc
that was a great misfortune and i dare say you have told them already
mr vyse is so sensitive
i remember how i used to get on his nerves at rome
i am very sorry about it all and should not feel easy unless i warned you
believe me your anxious and loving cousin charlotte   lucy was much annoyed and replied as follows  beauchamp mansions sw
dear charlotte  many thanks for your warning
when mr emerson forgot himself on the mountain you made me promise not to tell mother because you said she would blame you for not being always with me
i have kept that promise and cannot possibly tell her now
i have said both to her and cecil that i met the emersons at florence and that they are respectable peoplewhich i do thinkand the reason that he offered miss lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself
she should have tried at the rectory
i cannot begin making a fuss at this stage
you must see that it would be too absurd
if the emersons heard i had complained of them they would think themselves of importance which is exactly what they are not
i like the old father and look forward to seeing him again
as for the son i am sorry for him when we meet rather than for myself
they are known to cecil who is very well and spoke of you the other day
we expect to be married in january
miss lavish cannot have told you much about me for i am not at windy corner at all but here
please do not put private outside your envelope again
no one opens my letters
yours affectionately l
m honeychurch   secrecy has this disadvantage we lose the sense of proportion we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not
were lucy and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy cecils life if he discovered it or with a little thing which he would laugh at
miss bartlett suggested the former
perhaps she was right
it had become a great thing now
left to herself lucy would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously and it would have remained a little thing
emerson not harris it was only that a few weeks ago
she tried to tell cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school
but her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped
she and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on
it did her no harm cecil thought to learn the framework of society while society itself was absent on the golflinks or the moors
the weather was cool and it did her no harm
in spite of the season mrs vyse managed to scrape together a dinnerparty consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people
the food was poor but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl
one was tired of everything it seemed
one launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter
in this atmosphere the pension bertolini and windy corner appeared equally crude and lucy saw that her london career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past
the grandchildren asked her to play the piano
she played schumann
now some beethoven called cecil when the querulous beauty of the music had died
she shook her head and played schumann again
the melody rose unprofitably magical
it broke it was resumed broken not marching once from the cradle to the grave
the sadness of the incompletethe sadness that is often life but should never be artthrobbed in its disjected phrases and made the nerves of the audience throb
not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the bertolini and too much schumann was not the remark that mr beebe had passed to himself when she returned
when the guests were gone and lucy had gone to bed mrs vyse paced up and down the drawingroom discussing her little party with her son
mrs vyse was a nice woman but her personality like many anothers had been swamped by london for it needs a strong head to live among many people
the too vast orb of her fate had crushed her and she had seen too many seasons too many cities too many men for her abilities and even with cecil she was mechanical and behaved as if he was not one son but so to speak a filial crowd
make lucy one of us she said looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence and straining her lips apart until she spoke again
lucy is becoming wonderfulwonderful  her music always was wonderful  yes but she is purging off the honeychurch taint most excellent honeychurches but you know what i mean
she is not always quoting servants or asking one how the pudding is made  italy has done it  perhaps she murmured thinking of the museum that represented italy to her
it is just possible
cecil mind you marry her next january
she is one of us already  but her music he exclaimed
the style of her
how she kept to schumann when like an idiot i wanted beethoven
schumann was right for this evening
schumann was the thing
do you know mother i shall have our children educated just like lucy
bring them up among honest country folks for freshness send them to italy for subtlety and thennot till thenlet them come to london
i dont believe in these london educations he broke off remembering that he had had one himself and concluded at all events not for women  make her one of us repeated mrs vyse and processed to bed
as she was dozing off a crythe cry of nightmarerang from lucys room
lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but mrs vyse thought it kind to go herself
she found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek
i am so sorry mrs vyseit is these dreams  bad dreams  just dreams  the elder lady smiled and kissed her saying very distinctly you should have heard us talking about you dear
he admires you more than ever
dream of that  lucy returned the kiss still covering one cheek with her hand
mrs vyse recessed to bed
cecil whom the cry had not awoke snored
darkness enveloped the flat
chapter xii twelfth chapter   it was a saturday afternoon gay and brilliant after abundant rains and the spirit of youth dwelt in it though the season was now autumn
all that was gracious triumphed
as the motorcars passed through summer street they raised only a little dust and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines
mr beebe at leisure for lifes amenities leant over his rectory gate
freddy leant by him smoking a pendant pipe
suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little  mm  they might amuse you  freddy whom his fellowcreatures never amused suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy and so on since they had only just moved in
i suggested we should hinder them said mr beebe
they are worth it unlatching the gate he sauntered over the triangular green to cissie villa
hullo he cried shouting in at the open door through which much squalor was visible
a grave voice replied hullo  ive brought someone to see you  ill be down in a minute  the passage was blocked by a wardrobe which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs
mr beebe edged round it with difficulty
the sittingroom itself was blocked with books
are these people great readers freddy whispered
are they that sort  i fancy they know how to reada rare accomplishment
what have they got
byron
exactly
a shropshire lad
never heard of it
the way of all flesh
never heard of it
gibbon
hullo
dear george reads german
umumschopenhauer nietzsche and so we go on
well i suppose your generation knows its own business honeychurch  mr
beebe look at that said freddy in awestruck tones
on the cornice of the wardrobe the hand of an amateur had painted this inscription mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes  i know
isnt it jolly
i like that
im certain thats the old mans doing  how very odd of him  surely you agree  but freddy was his mothers son and felt that one ought not to go on spoiling the furniture
pictures the clergyman continued scrambling about the room
giottothey got that at florence ill be bound  the same as lucys got  oh bytheby did miss honeychurch enjoy london  she came back yesterday  i suppose she had a good time  yes very said freddy taking up a book
she and cecil are thicker than ever  thats good hearing  i wish i wasnt such a fool mr beebe  mr beebe ignored the remark
lucy used to be nearly as stupid as i am but itll be very different now mother thinks
she will read all kinds of books  so will you  only medical books
not books that you can talk about afterwards
cecil is teaching lucy italian and he says her playing is wonderful
there are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed
cecil says  what on earth are those people doing upstairs
emersonwe think well come another time  george ran downstairs and pushed them into the room without speaking
let me introduce mr honeychurch a neighbour  then freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth
perhaps he was shy perhaps he was friendly or perhaps he thought that georges face wanted washing
at all events he greeted him with how dye do
come and have a bathe  oh all right said george impassive
mr beebe was highly entertained
how dye do
how dye do
come and have a bathe he chuckled
thats the best conversational opening ive ever heard
but im afraid it will only act between men
can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with how do you do
come and have a bathe
and yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal  i tell you that they shall be said mr emerson who had been slowly descending the stairs
good afternoon mr beebe
i tell you they shall be comrades and george thinks the same  we are to raise ladies to our level the clergyman inquired
the garden of eden pursued mr emerson still descending which you place in the past is really yet to come
we shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies  mr beebe disclaimed placing the garden of eden anywhere
in thisnot in other thingswe men are ahead
we despise the body less than women do
but not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden  i say what about this bathe murmured freddy appalled at the mass of philosophy that was approaching him
i believed in a return to nature once
but how can we return to nature when we have never been with her
today i believe that we must discover nature
after many conquests we shall attain simplicity
it is our heritage  let me introduce mr honeychurch whose sister you will remember at florence  how do you do
very glad to see you and that you are taking george for a bathe
very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry
marriage is a duty
i am sure that she will be happy for we know mr vyse too
he has been most kind
he met us by chance in the national gallery and arranged everything about this delightful house
though i hope i have not vexed sir harry otway
i have met so few liberal landowners and i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the conservative attitude
ah this wind
you do well to bathe
yours is a glorious country honeychurch  not a bit mumbled freddy
i mustthat is to say i have tohave the pleasure of calling on you later on my mother says i hope  call my lad
who taught us that drawingroom twaddle
call on your grandmother
listen to the wind among the pines
yours is a glorious country  mr beebe came to the rescue
mr
emerson he will call i shall call you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed
i trust that you have realized about the ten days interval
it does not count that i helped you with the staireyes yesterday
it does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon  yes go and bathe george
why do you dawdle talking
bring them back to tea
bring back some milk cakes honey
the change will do you good
george has been working very hard at his office
i cant believe hes well  george bowed his head dusty and sombre exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture
do you really want this bathe freddy asked him
it is only a pond dont you know
i dare say you are used to something better  yesi have said yes already  mr beebe felt bound to assist his young friend and led the way out of the house and into the pinewoods
how glorious it was
for a little time the voice of old mr emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy
it ceased and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees
mr beebe who could be silent but who could not bear silence was compelled to chatter since the expedition looked like a failure and neither of his companions would utter a word
he spoke of florence
george attended gravely assenting or dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as inexplicable as the motions of the treetops above their heads
and what a coincidence that you should meet mr vyse
did you realize that you would find all the pension bertolini down here  i did not
miss lavish told me  when i was a young man i always meant to write a history of coincidence  no enthusiasm
though as a matter of fact coincidences are much rarer than we suppose
for example it isnt purely coincidentally that you are here now when one comes to reflect  to his relief george began to talk
it is
i have reflected
it is fate
everything is fate
we are flung together by fate drawn apart by fateflung together drawn apart
the twelve winds blow uswe settle nothing  you have not reflected at all rapped the clergyman
let me give you a useful tip emerson attribute nothing to fate
dont say i didnt do this for you did it ten to one
now ill crossquestion you
where did you first meet miss honeychurch and myself  italy  and where did you meet mr vyse who is going to marry miss honeychurch  national gallery  looking at italian art
there you are and yet you talk of coincidence and fate
you naturally seek out things italian and so do we and our friends
this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it  it is fate that i am here persisted george
but you can call it italy if it makes you less unhappy  mr beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject
but he was infinitely tolerant of the young and had no desire to snub george
and so for this and for other reasons my history of coincidence is still to write  silence
wishing to round off the episode he added we are all so glad that you have come  silence
here we are called freddy
oh good exclaimed mr beebe mopping his brow
in theres the pond
i wish it was bigger he added apologetically
they climbed down a slippery bank of pineneedles
there lay the pond set in its little alp of greenonly a pond but large enough to contain the human body and pure enough to reflect the sky
on account of the rains the waters had flooded the surrounding grass which showed like a beautiful emerald path tempting these feet towards the central pool
its distinctly successful as ponds go said mr beebe
no apologies are necessary for the pond  george sat down where the ground was dry and drearily unlaced his boots
arent those masses of willowherb splendid
i love willowherb in seed
whats the name of this aromatic plant  no one knew or seemed to care
these abrupt changes of vegetationthis little spongeous tract of water plants and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittleheather bracken hurts pines
very charming very charming  mr
beebe arent you bathing called freddy as he stripped himself
mr beebe thought he was not
waters wonderful cried freddy prancing in
waters water murmured george
wetting his hair firsta sure sign of apathyhe followed freddy into the divine as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds
it was necessary to use his muscles
it was necessary to keep clean
mr beebe watched them and watched the seeds of the willowherb dance chorically above their heads
apooshoo apooshoo apooshoo went freddy swimming for two strokes in either direction and then becoming involved in reeds or mud
is it worth it asked the other michelangelesque on the flooded margin
the bank broke away and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly
heepoofive swallowed a pollywog mr beebe waters wonderful waters simply ripping  waters not so bad said george reappearing from his plunge and sputtering at the sun
waters wonderful
mr beebe do  apooshoo kouf  mr beebe who was hot and who always acquiesced where possible looked around him
he could detect no parishioners except the pinetrees rising up steeply on all sides and gesturing to each other against the blue
how glorious it was
the world of motorcars and rural deans receded inimitably
water sky evergreens a windthese things not even the seasons can touch and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man
i may as well wash too and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward and he too asserted the wonder of the water
it was ordinary water nor was there very much of it and as freddy said it reminded one of swimming in a salad
the three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high after the fashion of the nymphs in gtterdmmerung
but either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spiritfor some reason or other a change came over them and they forgot italy and botany and fate
they began to play
mr beebe and freddy splashed each other
a little deferentially they splashed george
he was quiet they feared they had offended him
then all the forces of youth burst out
he smiled flung himself at them splashed them ducked them kicked them muddied them and drove them out of the pool
race you round it then cried freddy and they raced in the sunshine and george took a short cut and dirtied his shins and had to bathe a second time
then mr beebe consented to runa memorable sight
they ran to get dry they bathed to get cool they played at being indians in the willowherbs and in the bracken they bathed to get clean
and all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward proclaiming  no
we are what matters
without us shall no enterprise begin
to us shall all flesh turn in the end  a try
a try yelled freddy snatching up georges bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goalpost
socker rules george retorted scattering freddys bundle with a kick
goal  goal  pass  take care my watch cried mr beebe
clothes flew in all directions
take care my hat
no thats enough freddy
dress now
no i say  but the two young men were delirious
away they twinkled into the trees freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm george with a wideawake hat on his dripping hair
thatll do shouted mr beebe remembering that after all he was in his own parish
then his voice changed as if every pinetree was a rural dean
hi
steady on
i see people coming you fellows  yells and widening circles over the dappled earth
hi
hi
ladies  neither george nor freddy was truly refined
still they did not hear mr beebes last warning or they would have avoided mrs honeychurch cecil and lucy who were walking down to call on old mrs butterworth
freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet and dashed into some bracken
george whooped in their faces turned and scudded away down the path to the pond still clad in mr beebes hat
gracious alive cried mrs honeychurch
whoever were those unfortunate people
oh dears look away
and poor mr beebe too
whatever has happened  come this way immediately commanded cecil who always felt that he must lead women though he knew not whither and protect them though he knew not against what
he led them now towards the bracken where freddy sat concealed
oh poor mr beebe
was that his waistcoat we left in the path
cecil mr beebes waistcoat  no business of ours said cecil glancing at lucy who was all parasol and evidently minded  i fancy mr beebe jumped back into the pond  this way please mrs honeychurch this way  they followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions
well i cant help it said a voice close ahead and freddy reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds
i cant be trodden on can i  good gracious me dear so its you
what miserable management
why not have a comfortable bath at home with hot and cold laid on  look here mother a fellow must wash and a fellows got to dry and if another fellow  dear no doubt youre right as usual but you are in no position to argue
come lucy they turned
oh lookdont look
oh poor mr beebe
how unfortunate again  for mr beebe was just crawling out of the pond on whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float while george the worldweary george shouted to freddy that he had hooked a fish
and me ive swallowed one answered he of the bracken
ive swallowed a pollywog
it wriggleth in my tummy
i shall dieemerson you beast youve got on my bags  hush dears said mrs honeychurch who found it impossible to remain shocked
and do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first
all these colds come of not drying thoroughly  mother do come away said lucy
oh for goodness sake do come  hullo cried george so that again the ladies stopped
he regarded himself as dressed
barefoot barechested radiant and personable against the shadowy woods he called  hullo miss honeychurch
hullo  bow lucy better bow
whoever is it
i shall bow  miss honeychurch bowed
that evening and all that night the water ran away
on the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory
it had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will a passing benediction whose influence did not pass a holiness a spell a momentary chalice for youth
chapter xiii how miss bartletts boiler was so tiresome   how often had lucy rehearsed this bow this interview
but she had always rehearsed them indoors and with certain accessories which surely we have a right to assume
who could foretell that she and george would meet in the rout of a civilization amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth
she had imagined a young mr emerson who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent
she was prepared for all of these
but she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star
indoors herself partaking of tea with old mrs butterworth she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy that it is impossible to rehearse life
a fault in the scenery a face in the audience an irruption of the audience on to the stage and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing or mean too much
i will bow she had thought
i will not shake hands with him
that will be just the proper thing she had bowedbut to whom
to gods to heroes to the nonsense of schoolgirls
she had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world
so ran her thoughts while her faculties were busy with cecil
it was another of those dreadful engagement calls
mrs butterworth had wanted to see him and he did not want to be seen
he did not want to hear about hydrangeas why they change their colour at the seaside
he did not want to join the c o s when cross he was always elaborate and made long clever answers where yes or no would have done
lucy soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace
no one is perfect and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock
miss bartlett indeed though not in word had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory
lucy though she disliked the teacher regarded the teaching as profound and applied it to her lover
lucy said her mother when they got home is anything the matter with cecil  the question was ominous up till now mrs honeychurch had behaved with charity and restraint
no i dont think so mother cecils all right  perhaps hes tired  lucy compromised perhaps cecil was a little tired
because otherwiseshe pulled out her bonnetpins with gathering displeasurebecause otherwise i cannot account for him  i do think mrs butterworth is rather tiresome if you mean that  cecil has told you to think so
you were devoted to her as a little girl and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever
noit is just the same thing everywhere  let me just put your bonnet away may i  surely he could answer her civilly for one halfhour  cecil has a very high standard for people faltered lucy seeing trouble ahead
its part of his idealsit is really that that makes him sometimes seem  oh rubbish
if high ideals make a young man rude the sooner he gets rid of them the better said mrs honeychurch handing her the bonnet
now mother
ive seen you cross with mrs butterworth yourself  not in that way
at times i could wring her neck
but not in that way
no
it is the same with cecil all over  bythebyi never told you
i had a letter from charlotte while i was away in london  this attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile and mrs honeychurch resented it
since cecil came back from london nothing appears to please him
whenever i speak he wincesi see him lucy it is useless to contradict me
no doubt i am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical but i cannot help the drawingroom furniture your father bought it and we must put up with it will cecil kindly remember  ii see what you mean and certainly cecil oughtnt to
but he does not mean to be uncivilhe once explainedit is the things that upset himhe is easily upset by ugly thingshe is not uncivil to people  is it a thing or a person when freddy sings  you cant expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do  then why didnt he leave the room
why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyones pleasure  we mustnt be unjust to people faltered lucy
something had enfeebled her and the case for cecil which she had mastered so perfectly in london would not come forth in an effective form
the two civilizations had clashedcecil hinted that they mightand she was dazzled and bewildered as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes
good taste and bad taste were only catchwords garments of diverse cut and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pinetrees where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song
she remained in much embarrassment while mrs honeychurch changed her frock for dinner and every now and then she said a word and made things no better
there was no concealing the fact cecil had meant to be supercilious and he had succeeded
and lucyshe knew not whywished that the trouble could have come at any other time
go and dress dear youll be late  all right mother  dont say all right and stop
go  she obeyed but loitered disconsolately at the landing window
it faced north so there was little view and no view of the sky
now as in the winter the pinetrees hung close to her eyes
one connected the landing window with depression
no definite problem menaced her but she sighed to herself oh dear what shall i do what shall i do it seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly
and she ought not to have mentioned miss bartletts letter
she must be more careful her mother was rather inquisitive and might have asked what it was about
oh dear what should she doand then freddy came bounding upstairs and joined the ranks of the illbehaved
i say those are topping people  my dear baby how tiresome youve been
you have no business to take them bathing in the sacred lake its much too public
it was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else
do be more careful
you forget the place is growing half suburban  i say is anything on tomorrow week  not that i know of  then i want to ask the emersons up to sunday tennis  oh i wouldnt do that freddy i wouldnt do that with all this muddle  whats wrong with the court
they wont mind a bump or two and ive ordered new balls  i meant its better not
i really mean it  he seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage
she pretended not to mind but she could have screamed with temper
cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded mary with her brood of hotwater cans
then mrs honeychurch opened her door and said lucy what a noise youre making
i have something to say to you
did you say you had had a letter from charlotte and freddy ran away
yes
i really cant stop
i must dress too  hows charlotte  all right  lucy  the unfortunate girl returned
youve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of ones sentences
did charlotte mention her boiler  her what  dont you remember that her boiler was to be had out in october and her bath cistern cleaned out and all kinds of terrible todoings  i cant remember all charlottes worries said lucy bitterly
i shall have enough of my own now that you are not pleased with cecil  mrs honeychurch might have flamed out
she did not
she said come here old ladythank you for putting away my bonnetkiss me and though nothing is perfect lucy felt for the moment that her mother and windy corner and the weald in the declining sun were perfect
so the grittiness went out of life
it generally did at windy corner
at the last minute when the social machine was clogged hopelessly one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil
cecil despised their methodsperhaps rightly
at all events they were not his own
dinner was at halfpast seven
freddy gabbled the grace and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to
fortunately the men were hungry
nothing untoward occurred until the pudding
then freddy said  lucy whats emerson like  i saw him in florence said lucy hoping that this would pass for a reply
is he the clever sort or is he a decent chap  ask cecil it is cecil who brought him here  he is the clever sort like myself said cecil
freddy looked at him doubtfully
how well did you know them at the bertolini asked mrs honeychurch
oh very slightly
i mean charlotte knew them even less than i did  oh that reminds meyou never told me what charlotte said in her letter  one thing and another said lucy wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie
among other things that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street wondered if shed come up and see us and mercifully didnt  lucy i do call the way you talk unkind  she was a novelist said lucy craftily
the remark was a happy one for nothing roused mrs honeychurch so much as literature in the hands of females
she would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who instead of minding their houses and their children seek notoriety by print
her attitude was if books must be written let them be written by men and she developed it at great length while cecil yawned and freddy played at this year next year now never with his plumstones and lucy artfully fed the flames of her mothers wrath
but soon the conflagration died down and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness
there were too many ghosts about
the original ghostthat touch of lips on her cheekhad surely been laid long ago it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once
but it had begotten a spectral familymr
harris miss bartletts letter mr beebes memories of violetsand one or other of these was bound to haunt her before cecils very eyes
it was miss bartlett who returned now and with appalling vividness
i have been thinking lucy of that letter of charlottes
how is she  i tore the thing up  didnt she say how she was
how does she sound
cheerful  oh yes i suppose sononot very cheerful i suppose  then depend upon it it is the boiler
i know myself how water preys upon ones mind
i would rather anything elseeven a misfortune with the meat  cecil laid his hand over his eyes
so would i asserted freddy backing his mother upbacking up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance
and i have been thinking she added rather nervously surely we could squeeze charlotte in here next week and give her a nice holiday while the plumbers at tunbridge wells finish
i have not seen poor charlotte for so long  it was more than her nerves could stand
and she could not protest violently after her mothers goodness to her upstairs
mother no she pleaded
its impossible
we cant have charlotte on the top of the other things were squeezed to death as it is
freddys got a friend coming tuesday theres cecil and youve promised to take in minnie beebe because of the diphtheria scare
it simply cant be done  nonsense
it can  if minnie sleeps in the bath
not otherwise  minnie can sleep with you  i wont have her  then if youre so selfish mr floyd must share a room with freddy  miss bartlett miss bartlett miss bartlett moaned cecil again laying his hand over his eyes
its impossible repeated lucy
i dont want to make difficulties but it really isnt fair on the maids to fill up the house so  alas
the truth is dear you dont like charlotte  no i dont
and no more does cecil
she gets on our nerves
you havent seen her lately and dont realize how tiresome she can be though so good
so please mother dont worry us this last summer but spoil us by not asking her to come  hear hear said cecil
mrs honeychurch with more gravity than usual and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself replied this isnt very kind of you two
you have each other and all these woods to walk in so full of beautiful things and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers
you are young dears and however clever young people are and however many books they read they will never guess what it feels like to grow old  cecil crumbled his bread
i must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on my bike put in freddy
she thanked me for coming till i felt like such a fool and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right  i know dear
she is kind to everyone and yet lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return  but lucy hardened her heart
it was no good being kind to miss bartlett
she had tried herself too often and too recently
one might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt but one enriched neither miss bartlett nor any one else upon earth
she was reduced to saying i cant help it mother
i dont like charlotte
i admit its horrid of me  from your own account you told her as much  well she would leave florence so stupidly
she flurried  the ghosts were returning they filled italy they were even usurping the places she had known as a child
the sacred lake would never be the same again and on sunday week something would even happen to windy corner
how would she fight against ghosts
for a moment the visible world faded away and memories and emotions alone seemed real
i suppose miss bartlett must come since she boils eggs so well said cecil who was in rather a happier frame of mind thanks to the admirable cooking
i didnt mean the egg was well boiled corrected freddy because in point of fact she forgot to take it off and as a matter of fact i dont care for eggs
i only meant how jolly kind she seemed  cecil frowned again
oh these honeychurches
eggs boilers hydrangeas maidsof such were their lives compact
may me and lucy get down from our chairs he asked with scarcely veiled insolence
we dont want no dessert     chapter xiv how lucy faced the external situation bravely   of course miss bartlett accepted
and equally of course she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance and begged to be given an inferior spare roomsomething with no view anything
her love to lucy
and equally of course george emerson could come to tennis on the sunday week
lucy faced the situation bravely though like most of us she only faced the situation that encompassed her
she never gazed inwards
if at times strange images rose from the depths she put them down to nerves
when cecil brought the emersons to summer street it had upset her nerves
charlotte would burnish up past foolishness and this might upset her nerves
she was nervous at night
when she talked to georgethey met again almost immediately at the rectoryhis voice moved her deeply and she wished to remain near him
how dreadful if she really wished to remain near him
of course the wish was due to nerves which love to play such perverse tricks upon us
once she had suffered from things that came out of nothing and meant she didnt know what now cecil had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed
it is obvious enough for the reader to conclude she loves young emerson a reader in lucys place would not find it obvious
life is easy to chronicle but bewildering to practice and we welcome nerves or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire
she loved cecil george made her nervous will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed
but the external situationshe will face that bravely
the meeting at the rectory had passed off well enough
standing between mr beebe and cecil she had made a few temperate allusions to italy and george had replied
she was anxious to show that she was not shy and was glad that he did not seem shy either
a nice fellow said mr beebe afterwards he will work off his crudities in time
i rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully  lucy said he seems in better spirits
he laughs more  yes replied the clergyman
he is waking up  that was all
but as the week wore on more of her defences fell and she entertained an image that had physical beauty
in spite of the clearest directions miss bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival
she was due at the southeastern station at dorking whither mrs honeychurch drove to meet her
she arrived at the london and brighton station and had to hire a cab up
no one was at home except freddy and his friend who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour
cecil and lucy turned up at four oclock and these with little minnie beebe made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea
i shall never forgive myself said miss bartlett who kept on rising from her seat and had to be begged by the united company to remain
i have upset everything
bursting in on young people
but i insist on paying for my cab up
grant that at any rate  our visitors never do such dreadful things said lucy while her brother in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial exclaimed in irritable tones just what ive been trying to convince cousin charlotte of lucy for the last half hour  i do not feel myself an ordinary visitor said miss bartlett and looked at her frayed glove
all right if youd really rather
five shillings and i gave a bob to the driver  miss bartlett looked in her purse
only sovereigns and pennies
could any one give her change
freddy had half a quid and his friend had four halfcrowns
miss bartlett accepted their moneys and then said but who am i to give the sovereign to  lets leave it all till mother comes back suggested lucy
no dear your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me
we all have our little foibles and mine is the prompt settling of accounts  here freddys friend mr floyd made the one remark of his that need be quoted he offered to toss freddy for miss bartletts quid
a solution seemed in sight and even cecil who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view felt the eternal attraction of chance and turned round
but this did not do either
pleasepleasei know i am a sad spoilsport but it would make me wretched
i should practically be robbing the one who lost  freddy owes me fifteen shillings interposed cecil
so it will work out right if you give the pound to me  fifteen shillings said miss bartlett dubiously
how is that mr vyse  because dont you see freddy paid your cab
give me the pound and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling  miss bartlett who was poor at figures became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths
for a moment cecil was happy
he was playing at nonsense among his peers
then he glanced at lucy in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles
in january he would rescue his leonardo from this stupefying twaddle
but i dont see that exclaimed minnie beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction
i dont see why mr vyse is to have the quid  because of the fifteen shillings and the five they said solemnly
fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound you see  but i dont see  they tried to stifle her with cake
no thank you
im done
i dont see whyfreddy dont poke me
miss honeychurch your brothers hurting me
ow
what about mr floyds ten shillings
ow
no i dont see and i never shall see why miss whatshername shouldnt pay that bob for the driver  i had forgotten the driver said miss bartlett reddening
thank you dear for reminding me
a shilling was it
can any one give me change for half a crown  ill get it said the young hostess rising with decision
cecil give me that sovereign
no give me up that sovereign
ill get euphemia to change it and well start the whole thing again from the beginning  lucylucywhat a nuisance i am protested miss bartlett and followed her across the lawn
lucy tripped ahead simulating hilarity
when they were out of earshot miss bartlett stopped her wails and said quite briskly have you told him about him yet  no i havent replied lucy and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant
let me seea sovereigns worth of silver  she escaped into the kitchen
miss bartletts sudden transitions were too uncanny
it sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul
no i havent told cecil or any one she remarked when she returned
i promised you i shouldnt
here is your moneyall shillings except two halfcrowns
would you count it
you can settle your debt nicely now  miss bartlett was in the drawingroom gazing at the photograph of st john ascending which had been framed
how dreadful she murmured how more than dreadful if mr vyse should come to hear of it from some other source  oh no charlotte said the girl entering the battle
george emerson is all right and what other source is there  miss bartlett considered
for instance the driver
i saw him looking through the bushes at you remember he had a violet between his teeth  lucy shuddered a little
we shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we arent careful
how could a florentine cabdriver ever get hold of cecil  we must think of every possibility  oh its all right  or perhaps old mr emerson knows
in fact he is certain to know  i dont care if he does
i was grateful to you for your letter but even if the news does get round i think i can trust cecil to laugh at it  to contradict it  no to laugh at it but she knew in her heart that she could not trust him for he desired her untouched
very well dear you know best
perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when i was young
ladies are certainly different  now charlotte she struck at her playfully
you kind anxious thing
what would you have me do
first you say dont tell and then you say tell
which is it to be
quick  miss bartlett sighed i am no match for you in conversation dearest
i blush when i think how i interfered at florence and you so well able to look after yourself and so much cleverer in all ways than i am
you will never forgive me  shall we go out then
they will smash all the china if we dont  for the air rang with the shrieks of minnie who was being scalped with a teaspoon
dear one momentwe may not have this chance for a chat again
have you seen the young one yet  yes i have  what happened  we met at the rectory  what line is he taking up  no line
he talked about italy like any other person
it is really all right
what advantage would he get from being a cad to put it bluntly
i do wish i could make you see it my way
he really wont be any nuisance charlotte  once a cad always a cad
that is my poor opinion  lucy paused
cecil said one dayand i thought it so profoundthat there are two kinds of cadsthe conscious and the subconscious she paused again to be sure of doing justice to cecils profundity
through the window she saw cecil himself turning over the pages of a novel
it was a new one from smiths library
her mother must have returned from the station
once a cad always a cad droned miss bartlett
what i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head
i fell into all those violets and he was silly and surprised
i dont think we ought to blame him very much
it makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly
it really does it makes an enormous difference and he lost his head he doesnt admire me or any of that nonsense one straw
freddy rather likes him and has asked him up here on sunday so you can judge for yourself
he has improved he doesnt always look as if hes going to burst into tears
he is a clerk in the general managers office at one of the big railwaysnot a porter
and runs down to his father for weekends
papa was to do with journalism but is rheumatic and has retired
there
now for the garden she took hold of her guest by the arm
suppose we dont talk about this silly italian business any more
we want you to have a nice restful visit at windy corner with no worriting  lucy thought this rather a good speech
the reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it
whether miss bartlett detected the slip one cannot say for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people
she might have spoken further but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess
explanations took place and in the midst of them lucy escaped the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain
chapter xv the disaster within   the sunday after miss bartletts arrival was a glorious day like most of the days of that year
in the weald autumn approached breaking up the green monotony of summer touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist the beechtrees with russet the oaktrees with gold
up on the heights battalions of black pines witnessed the change themselves unchangeable
either country was spanned by a cloudless sky and in either arose the tinkle of church bells
the garden of windy corners was deserted except for a red book which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path
from the house came incoherent sounds as of females preparing for worship
the men say they wont gowell i dont blame themminnie says need she gotell her no nonsenseanne
mary
hook me behinddearest lucia may i trespass upon you for a pin for miss bartlett had announced that she at all events was one for church
the sun rose higher on its journey guided not by phaethon but by apollo competent unswerving divine
its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows on mr beebe down at summer street as he smiled over a letter from miss catharine alan on george emerson cleaning his fathers boots and lastly to complete the catalogue of memorable things on the red book mentioned previously
the ladies move mr beebe moves george moves and movement may engender shadow
but this book lies motionless to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly as though acknowledging the caress
presently lucy steps out of the drawingroom window
her new cerise dress has been a failure and makes her look tawdry and wan
at her throat is a garnet brooch on her finger a ring set with rubiesan engagement ring
her eyes are bent to the weald
she frowns a littlenot in anger but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry
in all that expanse no human eye is looking at her and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between apollo and the western hills
lucy
lucy
whats that book
whos been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil  its only the library book that cecils been reading  but pick it up and dont stand idling there like a flamingo  lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly under a loggia
she no longer read novels herself devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching cecil up
it was dreadful how little she knew and even when she thought she knew a thing like the italian painters she found she had forgotten it
only this morning she had confused francesco francia with piero della francesca and cecil had said what
you arent forgetting your italy already and this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground and above them scarcely conceivable elsewhere the dear sun
lucyhave you a sixpence for minnie and a shilling for yourself  she hastened in to her mother who was rapidly working herself into a sunday fluster
its a special collectioni forget what for
i do beg no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies see that minnie has a nice bright sixpence
where is the child
minnie
that books all warped
gracious how plain you look
put it under the atlas to press
minnie  oh mrs honeychurch from the upper regions
minnie dont be late
here comes the horseit was always the horse never the carriage
wheres charlotte
run up and hurry her
why is she so long
she had nothing to do
she never brings anything but blouses
poor charlottehow i do detest blouses
minnie  paganism is infectiousmore infectious than diphtheria or pietyand the rectors niece was taken to church protesting
as usual she didnt see why
why shouldnt she sit in the sun with the young men
the young men who had now appeared mocked her with ungenerous words
mrs honeychurch defended orthodoxy and in the midst of the confusion miss bartlett dressed in the very height of the fashion came strolling down the stairs
dear marian i am very sorry but i have no small changenothing but sovereigns and half crowns
could any one give me  yes easily
jump in
gracious me how smart you look
what a lovely frock
you put us all to shame  if i did not wear my best rags and tatters now when should i wear them said miss bartlett reproachfully
she got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse
the necessary roar ensued and then they drove off
goodbye
be good called out cecil
lucy bit her lip for the tone was sneering
on the subject of church and so on they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation
he had said that people ought to overhaul themselves and she did not want to overhaul herself she did not know it was done
honest orthodoxy cecil respected but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis he could not imagine it as a natural birthright that might grow heavenward like flowers
all that he said on this subject pained her though he exuded tolerance from every pore somehow the emersons were different
she saw the emersons after church
there was a line of carriages down the road and the honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite cissie villa
to save time they walked over the green to it and found father and son smoking in the garden
introduce me said her mother
unless the young man considers that he knows me already  he probably did but lucy ignored the sacred lake and introduced them formally
old mr emerson claimed her with much warmth and said how glad he was that she was going to be married
she said yes she was glad too and then as miss bartlett and minnie were lingering behind with mr beebe she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic and asked him how he liked his new house
very much he replied but there was a note of offence in his voice she had never known him offended before
he added we find though that the miss alans were coming and that we have turned them out
women mind such a thing
i am very much upset about it  i believe that there was some misunderstanding said mrs honeychurch uneasily
our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person said george who seemed disposed to carry the matter further
he thought we should be artistic
he is disappointed  and i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to give it up
what do you think he appealed to lucy
oh stop now you have come said lucy lightly
she must avoid censuring cecil
for it was on cecil that the little episode turned though his name was never mentioned
so george says
he says that the miss alans must go to the wall
yet it does seem so unkind  there is only a certain amount of kindness in the world said george watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages
yes exclaimed mrs honeychurch
thats exactly what i say
why all this twiddling and twaddling over two miss alans  there is a certain amount of kindness just as there is a certain amount of light he continued in measured tones
we cast a shadow on something wherever we stand and it is no good moving from place to place to save things because the shadow always follows
choose a place where you wont do harmyes choose a place where you wont do very much harm and stand in it for all you are worth facing the sunshine  oh mr emerson i see youre clever  eh  i see youre going to be clever
i hope you didnt go behaving like that to poor freddy  georges eyes laughed and lucy suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well
no i didnt he said
he behaved that way to me
it is his philosophy
only he starts life with it and i have tried the note of interrogation first  what do you mean
no never mind what you mean
dont explain
he looks forward to seeing you this afternoon
do you play tennis
do you mind tennis on sunday  george mind tennis on sunday
george after his education distinguish between sunday  very well george doesnt mind tennis on sunday
no more do i thats settled
mr emerson if you could come with your son we should be so pleased  he thanked her but the walk sounded rather far he could only potter about in these days
she turned to george and then he wants to give up his house to the miss alans  i know said george and put his arm round his fathers neck
the kindness that mr beebe and lucy had always known to exist in him came out suddenly like sunlight touching a vast landscapea touch of the morning sun
she remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection
miss bartlett approached
you know our cousin miss bartlett said mrs honeychurch pleasantly
you met her with my daughter in florence  yes indeed said the old man and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady
miss bartlett promptly got into the victoria
thus entrenched she emitted a formal bow
it was the pension bertolini again the diningtable with the decanters of water and wine
it was the old old battle of the room with the view
george did not respond to the bow
like any boy he blushed and was ashamed he knew that the chaperon remembered
he said iill come up to tennis if i can manage it and went into the house
perhaps anything that he did would have pleased lucy but his awkwardness went straight to her heart men were not gods after all but as human and as clumsy as girls even men might suffer from unexplained desires and need help
to one of her upbringing and of her destination the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar but she had surmised it at florence when george threw her photographs into the river arno
george dont go cried his father who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them
george has been in such good spirits today and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon  lucy caught her cousins eye
something in its mute appeal made her reckless
yes she said raising her voice i do hope he will then she went to the carriage and murmured the old man hasnt been told i knew it was all right mrs honeychurch followed her and they drove away
satisfactory that mr emerson had not been told of the florence escapade yet lucys spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven
satisfactory yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy
all the way home the horses hoofs sang a tune to her he has not told he has not told her brain expanded the melody he has not told his fatherto whom he tells all things
it was not an exploit
he did not laugh at me when i had gone she raised her hand to her cheek
he does not love me
no
how terrible if he did
but he has not told
he will not tell  she longed to shout the words it is all right
its a secret between us two for ever
cecil will never hear she was even glad that miss bartlett had made her promise secrecy that last dark evening at florence when they had knelt packing in his room
the secret big or little was guarded
only three english people knew of it in the world
thus she interpreted her joy
she greeted cecil with unusual radiance because she felt so safe
as he helped her out of the carriage she said  the emersons have been so nice
george emerson has improved enormously  how are my protgs asked cecil who took no real interest in them and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to windy corner for educational purposes
protgs she exclaimed with some warmth
for the only relationship which cecil conceived was feudal that of protector and protected
he had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girls soul yearned
you shall see for yourself how your protgs are
george emerson is coming up this afternoon
he is a most interesting man to talk to
only dont she nearly said dont protect him but the bell was ringing for lunch and as often happened cecil had paid no great attention to her remarks
charm not argument was to be her forte
lunch was a cheerful meal
generally lucy was depressed at meals
some one had to be soothedeither cecil or miss bartlett or a being not visible to the mortal eyea being who whispered to her soul it will not last this cheerfulness
in january you must go to london to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men but today she felt she had received a guarantee
her mother would always sit there her brother here
the sun though it had moved a little since the morning would never be hidden behind the western hills
after luncheon they asked her to play
she had seen glucks armide that year and played from memory the music of the enchanted gardenthe music to which renaud approaches beneath the light of an eternal dawn the music that never gains never wanes but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland
such music is not for the piano and her audience began to get restive and cecil sharing the discontent called out now play us the other gardenthe one in parsifal  she closed the instrument
not very dutiful said her mothers voice
fearing that she had offended cecil she turned quickly round
there george was
he had crept in without interrupting her
oh i had no idea she exclaimed getting very red and then without a word of greeting she reopened the piano
cecil should have the parsifal and anything else that he liked
our performer has changed her mind said miss bartlett perhaps implying she will play the music to mr emerson
lucy did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do
she played a few bars of the flower maidens song very badly and then she stopped
i vote tennis said freddy disgusted at the scrappy entertainment
yes so do i once more she closed the unfortunate piano
i vote you have a mens four  all right  not for me thank you said cecil
i will not spoil the set he never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth
oh come along cecil
im bad floyds rotten and so i dare says emerson  george corrected him i am not bad  one looked down ones nose at this
then certainly i wont play said cecil while miss bartlett under the impression that she was snubbing george added i agree with you mr vyse
you had much better not play
much better not  minnie rushing in where cecil feared to tread announced that she would play
i shall miss every ball anyway so what does it matter but sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion
then it will have to be lucy said mrs honeychurch you must fall back on lucy
there is no other way out of it
lucy go and change your frock  lucys sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature
she kept it without hypocrisy in the morning and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon
as she changed her frock she wondered whether cecil was sneering at her really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him
mr floyd was her partner
she liked music but how much better tennis seemed
how much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms
once more music appeared to her the employment of a child
george served and surprised her by his anxiety to win
she remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at santa croce because things wouldnt fit how after the death of that obscure italian he had leant over the parapet by the arno and said to her i shall want to live i tell you he wanted to live now to win at tennis to stand for all he was worth in the sunthe sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes and he did win
ah how beautiful the weald looked
the hills stood out above its radiance as fiesole stands above the tuscan plain and the south downs if one chose were the mountains of carrara
she might be forgetting her italy but she was noticing more things in her england
one could play a new game with the view and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for florence
ah how beautiful the weald looked
but now cecil claimed her
he chanced to be in a lucid critical mood and would not sympathize with exaltation
he had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others
he would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out i say listen to this lucy
three split infinitives  dreadful said lucy and missed her stroke
when they had finished their set he still went on reading there was some murder scene and really everyone must listen to it
freddy and mr floyd were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels but the other two acquiesced
the scene is laid in florence  what fun cecil
read away
come mr emerson sit down after all your energy she had forgiven george as she put it and she made a point of being pleasant to him
he jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking youand are you tired  of course im not  do you mind being beaten  she was going to answer no when it struck her that she did mind so she answered yes she added merrily i dont see youre such a splendid player though
the light was behind you and it was in my eyes  i never said i was  why you did  you didnt attend  you saidoh dont go in for accuracy at this house
we all exaggerate and we get very angry with people who dont  the scene is laid in florence repeated cecil with an upward note
lucy recollected herself
sunset
leonora was speeding  lucy interrupted
leonora
is leonora the heroine
whos the book by  joseph emery prank
sunset
leonora speeding across the square
pray the saints she might not arrive too late
sunsetthe sunset of italy
under orcagnas loggiathe loggia de lanzi as we sometimes call it now  lucy burst into laughter
joseph emery prank indeed
why its miss lavish
its miss lavishs novel and shes publishing it under somebody elses name  who may miss lavish be  oh a dreadful personmr
emerson you remember miss lavish  excited by her pleasant afternoon she clapped her hands
george looked up
of course i do
i saw her the day i arrived at summer street
it was she who told me that you lived here  werent you pleased she meant to see miss lavish but when he bent down to the grass without replying it struck her that she could mean something else
she watched his head which was almost resting against her knee and she thought that the ears were reddening
no wonder the novels bad she added
i never liked miss lavish
but i suppose one ought to read it as ones met her  all modern books are bad said cecil who was annoyed at her inattention and vented his annoyance on literature
every one writes for money in these days  oh cecil  it is so
i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer  cecil this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow
the ups and downs in his voice were noticeable but they did not affect her
she had dwelt amongst melody and movement and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his
leaving him to be annoyed she gazed at the black head again
she did not want to stroke it but she saw herself wanting to stroke it the sensation was curious
how do you like this view of ours mr emerson  i never notice much difference in views  what do you mean  because theyre all alike
because all that matters in them is distance and air  hm said cecil uncertain whether the remark was striking or not
my fatherhe looked up at her and he was a little flushedsays that there is only one perfect viewthe view of the sky straight over our heads and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it  i expect your father has been reading dante said cecil fingering the novel which alone permitted him to lead the conversation
he told us another day that views are really crowdscrowds of trees and houses and hillsand are bound to resemble each other like human crowdsand that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural for the same reason  lucys lips parted
for a crowd is more than the people who make it up
something gets added to itno one knows howjust as something has got added to those hills  he pointed with his racquet to the south downs
what a splendid idea she murmured
i shall enjoy hearing your father talk again
im so sorry hes not so well  no he isnt well  theres an absurd account of a view in this book said cecil
also that men fall into two classesthose who forget views and those who remember them even in small rooms  mr
emerson have you any brothers or sisters  none
why  you spoke of us  my mother i was meaning  cecil closed the novel with a bang
oh cecilhow you made me jump  i will inflict joseph emery prank on you no longer  i can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as hindhead
it is the first thing that i remember  cecil got up the man was illbredhe hadnt put on his coat after tennishe didnt do
he would have strolled away if lucy had not stopped him
cecil do read the thing about the view  not while mr emerson is here to entertain us  noread away
i think nothings funnier than to hear silly things read out loud
if mr emerson thinks us frivolous he can go  this struck cecil as subtle and pleased him
it put their visitor in the position of a prig
somewhat mollified he sat down again
mr
emerson go and find tennis balls she opened the book
cecil must have his reading and anything else that he liked
but her attention wandered to georges mother whoaccording to mr eagerhad been murdered in the sight of god andaccording to her sonhad seen as far as hindhead
am i really to go asked george
no of course not really she answered
chapter two said cecil yawning
find me chapter two if it isnt bothering you  chapter two was found and she glanced at its opening sentences
she thought she had gone mad
herehand me the book  she heard her voice saying it isnt worth readingits too silly to readi never saw such rubbishit oughtnt to be allowed to be printed  he took the book from her
leonora he read sat pensive and alone
before her lay the rich champaign of tuscany dotted over with many a smiling village
the season was spring  miss lavish knew somehow and had printed the past in draggled prose for cecil to read and for george to hear
a golden haze he read
he read afar off the towers of florence while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets
all unobserved antonio stole up behind her  lest cecil should see her face she turned to george and saw his face
he read there came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use
no eloquence was his nor did he suffer from the lack of it
he simply enfolded her in his manly arms  this isnt the passage i wanted he informed them there is another much funnier further on he turned over the leaves
should we go in to tea said lucy whose voice remained steady
she led the way up the garden cecil following her george last
she thought a disaster was averted
but when they entered the shrubbery it came
the book as if it had not worked mischief enough had been forgotten and cecil must go back for it and george who loved passionately must blunder against her in the narrow path
no she gasped and for the second time was kissed by him
as if no more was possible he slipped back cecil rejoined her they reached the upper lawn alone
chapter xvi lying to george   but lucy had developed since the spring
that is to say she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove
though the danger was greater she was not shaken by deep sobs
she said to cecil i am not coming in to teatell motheri must write some letters and went up to her room
then she prepared for action
love felt and returned love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet reappeared now as the worlds enemy and she must stifle it
she sent for miss bartlett
the contest lay not between love and duty
perhaps there never is such a contest
it lay between the real and the pretended and lucys first aim was to defeat herself
as her brain clouded over as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves
she conquered her breakdown tampering with the truth she forgot that the truth had ever been
remembering that she was engaged to cecil she compelled herself to confused remembrances of george he was nothing to her he never had been anything he had behaved abominably she had never encouraged him
the armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness and hides a man not only from others but from his own soul
in a few moments lucy was equipped for battle
something too awful has happened she began as soon as her cousin arrived
do you know anything about miss lavishs novel  miss bartlett looked surprised and said that she had not read the book nor known that it was published eleanor was a reticent woman at heart
there is a scene in it
the hero and heroine make love
do you know about that  dear  do you know about it please she repeated
they are on a hillside and florence is in the distance  my good lucia i am all at sea
i know nothing about it whatever  there are violets
i cannot believe it is a coincidence
charlotte charlotte how could you have told her
i have thought before speaking it must be you  told her what she asked with growing agitation
about that dreadful afternoon in february  miss bartlett was genuinely moved
oh lucy dearest girlshe hasnt put that in her book  lucy nodded
not so that one could recognize it
yes  then nevernevernever more shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine  so you did tell  i did just happenwhen i had tea with her at romein the course of conversation  but charlottewhat about the promise you gave me when we were packing
why did you tell miss lavish when you wouldnt even let me tell mother  i will never forgive eleanor
she has betrayed my confidence  why did you tell her though
this is a most serious thing  why does any one tell anything
the question is eternal and it was not surprising that miss bartlett should only sigh faintly in response
she had done wrongshe admitted it she only hoped that she had not done harm she had told eleanor in the strictest confidence
lucy stamped with irritation
cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to mr emerson it upset mr emerson and he insulted me again
behind cecils back
ugh
is it possible that men are such brutes
behind cecils back as we were walking up the garden  miss bartlett burst into selfaccusations and regrets
what is to be done now
can you tell me  oh lucyi shall never forgive myself never to my dying day
fancy if your prospects  i know said lucy wincing at the word
i see now why you wanted me to tell cecil and what you meant by some other source you knew that you had told miss lavish and that she was not reliable  it was miss bartletts turn to wince
however said the girl despising her cousins shiftiness whats dones done
you have put me in a most awkward position
how am i to get out of it  miss bartlett could not think
the days of her energy were over
she was a visitor not a chaperon and a discredited visitor at that
she stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage
he mustthat man must have such a setting down that he wont forget
and whos to give it him
i cant tell mother nowowing to you
nor cecil charlotte owing to you
i am caught up every way
i think i shall go mad
i have no one to help me
thats why ive sent for you
whats wanted is a man with a whip  miss bartlett agreed one wanted a man with a whip
yesbut its no good agreeing
whats to be done we women go maundering on
what does a girl do when she comes across a cad  i always said he was a cad dear
give me credit for that at all events
from the very first momentwhen he said his father was having a bath  oh bother the credit and whos been right or wrong
weve both made a muddle of it
george emerson is still down the garden there and is he to be left unpunished or isnt he
i want to know  miss bartlett was absolutely helpless
her own exposure had unnerved her and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain
she moved feebly to the window and tried to detect the cads white flannels among the laurels
you were ready enough at the bertolini when you rushed me off to rome
cant you speak again to him now  willingly would i move heaven and earth  i want something more definite said lucy contemptuously
will you speak to him
it is the least you can do surely considering it all happened because you broke your word  never again shall eleanor lavish be a friend of mine  really charlotte was outdoing herself
yes or no please yes or no  it is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle george emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand
very well said lucy with an angry gesture
no one will help me
i will speak to him myself and immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along
hullo emerson called freddy from below
found the lost ball
good man
want any tea and there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace
oh lucy but that is brave of you
i admire you  they had gathered round george who beckoned she felt over the rubbish the sloppy thoughts the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul
her anger faded at the sight of him
ah
the emersons were fine people in their way
she had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying  freddy has taken him into the diningroom
the others are going down the garden
come
let us get this over quickly
come
i want you in the room of course  lucy do you mind doing it  how can you ask such a ridiculous question  poor lucy she stretched out her hand
i seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever i go lucy nodded
she remembered their last evening at florencethe packing the candle the shadow of miss bartletts toque on the door
she was not to be trapped by pathos a second time
eluding her cousins caress she led the way downstairs
try the jam freddy was saying
the jams jolly good  george looking big and dishevelled was pacing up and down the diningroom
as she entered he stopped and said  nonothing to eat  you go down to the others said lucy charlotte and i will give mr emerson all he wants
wheres mother  shes started on her sunday writing
shes in the drawingroom  thats all right
you go away  he went off singing
lucy sat down at the table
miss bartlett who was thoroughly frightened took up a book and pretended to read
she would not be drawn into an elaborate speech
she just said i cant have it mr emerson
i cannot even talk to you
go out of this house and never come into it again as long as i live here flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door
i hate a row
go please  what  no discussion  but i cant  she shook her head
go please
i do not want to call in mr vyse  you dont mean he said absolutely ignoring miss bartlettyou dont mean that you are going to marry that man  the line was unexpected
she shrugged her shoulders as if his vulgarity wearied her
you are merely ridiculous she said quietly
then his words rose gravely over hers you cannot live with vyse
hes only for an acquaintance
he is for society and cultivated talk
he should know no one intimately least of all a woman  it was a new light on cecils character
have you ever talked to vyse without feeling tired  i can scarcely discuss  no but have you ever
he is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to thingsbooks picturesbut kill when they come to people
thats why ill speak out through all this muddle even now
its shocking enough to lose you in any case but generally a man must deny himself joy and i would have held back if your cecil had been a different person
i would never have let myself go
but i saw him first in the national gallery when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters
then he brings us here and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour
that is the man all overplaying tricks on people on the most sacred form of life that he can find
next i meet you together and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked when it was for you to settle whether you were shocked or no
cecil all over again
he darent let a woman decide
hes the type whos kept europe back for a thousand years
every moment of his life hes forming you telling you whats charming or amusing or ladylike telling you what a man thinks womanly and you you of all women listen to his voice instead of to your own
so it was at the rectory when i met you both again so it has been the whole of this afternoon
thereforenot therefore i kissed you because the book made me do that and i wish to goodness i had more selfcontrol
im not ashamed
i dont apologize
but it has frightened you and you may not have noticed that i love you
or would you have told me to go and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly
but thereforetherefore i settled to fight him  lucy thought of a very good remark
you say mr vyse wants me to listen to him mr emerson
pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit  and he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality
he said  yes i have and sank down as if suddenly weary
im the same kind of brute at bottom
this desire to govern a womanit lies very deep and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden
but i do love you surely in a better way than he does he thought
yesreally in a better way
i want you to have your own thoughts even when i hold you in my arms he stretched them towards her
lucy be quicktheres no time for us to talk nowcome to me as you came in the spring and afterwards i will be gentle and explain
i have cared for you since that man died
i cannot live without you no good i thought she is marrying someone else but i meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun
as you came through the wood i saw that nothing else mattered
i called
i wanted to live and have my chance of joy  and mr vyse said lucy who kept commendably calm
does he not matter
that i love cecil and shall be his wife shortly
a detail of no importance i suppose  but he stretched his arms over the table towards her
may i ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition  he said it is our last chance
i shall do all that i can and as if he had done all else he turned to miss bartlett who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening
you wouldnt stop us this second time if you understood he said
i have been into the dark and i am going back into it unless you will try to understand  her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards as though demolishing some invisible obstacle
she did not answer
it is being young he said quietly picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go
it is being certain that lucy cares for me really
it is that love and youth matter intellectually  in silence the two women watched him
his last remark they knew was nonsense but was he going after it or not
would not he the cad the charlatan attempt a more dramatic finish
no
he was apparently content
he left them carefully closing the front door and when they looked through the hall window they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house
their tongues were loosed and they burst into stealthy rejoicings
oh luciacome back hereoh what an awful man  lucy had no reactionat least not yet
well he amuses me she said
either im mad or else he is and im inclined to think its the latter
one more fuss through with you charlotte
many thanks
i think though that this is the last
my admirer will hardly trouble me again  and miss bartlett too essayed the roguish  well it isnt everyone who could boast such a conquest dearest is it
oh one oughtnt to laugh really
it might have been very serious
but you were so sensible and braveso unlike the girls of my day  lets go down to them  but once in the open air she paused
some emotionpity terror love but the emotion was strongseized her and she was aware of autumn
summer was ending and the evening brought her odours of decay the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring
that something or other mattered intellectually
a leaf violently agitated danced past her while other leaves lay motionless
that the earth was hastening to reenter darkness and the shadows of those trees over windy corner
hullo lucy
theres still light enough for another set if you twoll hurry  mr
emerson has had to go  what a nuisance
that spoils the four
i say cecil do play do theres a good chap
its floyds last day
do play tennis with us just this once  cecils voice came my dear freddy i am no athlete
as you well remarked this very morning there are some chaps who are no good for anything but books i plead guilty to being such a chap and will not inflict myself on you  the scales fell from lucys eyes
how had she stood cecil for a moment
he was absolutely intolerable and the same evening she broke off her engagement
chapter xvii lying to cecil   he was bewildered
he had nothing to say
he was not even angry but stood with a glass of whiskey between his hands trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion
she had chosen the moment before bed when in accordance with their bourgeois habit she always dispensed drinks to the men
freddy and mr floyd were sure to retire with their glasses while cecil invariably lingered sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard
i am very sorry about it she said i have carefully thought things over
we are too different
i must ask you to release me and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl  it was a suitable speech but she was more angry than sorry and her voice showed it
differenthowhow  i havent had a really good education for one thing she continued still on her knees by the sideboard
my italian trip came too late and i am forgetting all that i learnt there
i shall never be able to talk to your friends or behave as a wife of yours should  i dont understand you
you arent like yourself
youre tired lucy  tired she retorted kindling at once
that is exactly like you
you always think women dont mean what they say  well you sound tired as if something has worried you  what if i do
it doesnt prevent me from realizing the truth
i cant marry you and you will thank me for saying so some day  you had that bad headache yesterdayall rightfor she had exclaimed indignantly i see its much more than headaches
but give me a moments time he closed his eyes
you must excuse me if i say stupid things but my brain has gone to pieces
part of it lives three minutes back when i was sure that you loved me and the other parti find it difficulti am likely to say the wrong thing  it struck her that he was not behaving so badly and her irritation increased
she again desired a struggle not a discussion
to bring on the crisis she said  there are days when one sees clearly and this is one of them
things must come to a breakingpoint some time and it happens to be today
if you want to know quite a little thing decided me to speak to youwhen you wouldnt play tennis with freddy  i never do play tennis said cecil painfully bewildered i never could play
i dont understand a word you say  you can play well enough to make up a four
i thought it abominably selfish of you  no i cantwell never mind the tennis
why couldnt youcouldnt you have warned me if you felt anything wrong
you talked of our wedding at lunchat least you let me talk  i knew you wouldnt understand said lucy quite crossly
i might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations
of course it isnt the tennisthat was only the last straw to all i have been feeling for weeks
surely it was better not to speak until i felt certain she developed this position
often before i have wondered if i was fitted for your wifefor instance in london and are you fitted to be my husband
i dont think so
you dont like freddy nor my mother
there was always a lot against our engagement cecil but all our relations seemed pleased and we met so often and it was no good mentioning it untilwell until all things came to a point
they have today
i see clearly
i must speak
thats all  i cannot think you were right said cecil gently
i cannot tell why but though all that you say sounds true i feel that you are not treating me fairly
its all too horrible  whats the good of a scene  no good
but surely i have a right to hear a little more  he put down his glass and opened the window
from where she knelt jangling her keys she could see a slit of darkness and peering into it as if it would tell him that little more his long thoughtful face
dont open the window and youd better draw the curtain too freddy or any one might be outside he obeyed
i really think we had better go to bed if you dont mind
i shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards
as you say it is all too horrible and it is no good talking  but to cecil now that he was about to lose her she seemed each moment more desirable
he looked at her instead of through her for the first time since they were engaged
from a leonardo she had become a living woman with mysteries and forces of her own with qualities that even eluded art
his brain recovered from the shock and in a burst of genuine devotion he cried but i love you and i did think you loved me  i did not she said
i thought i did at first
i am sorry and ought to have refused you this last time too  he began to walk up and down the room and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour
she had counted on his being petty
it would have made things easier for her
by a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition
you dont love me evidently
i dare say you are right not to
but it would hurt a little less if i knew why  becausea phrase came to her and she accepted ityoure the sort who cant know any one intimately  a horrified look came into his eyes
i dont mean exactly that
but you will question me though i beg you not to and i must say something
it is that more or less
when we were only acquaintances you let me be myself but now youre always protecting me her voice swelled
i wont be protected
i will choose for myself what is ladylike and right
to shield me is an insult
cant i be trusted to face the truth but i must get it secondhand through you
a womans place
you despise my motheri know you dobecause shes conventional and bothers over puddings but oh goodnessshe rose to her feetconventional cecil youre that for you may understand beautiful things but you dont know how to use them and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music and would try to wrap up me
i wont be stifled not by the most glorious music for people are more glorious and you hide them from me
thats why i break off my engagement
you were all right as long as you kept to things but when you came to people she stopped
there was a pause
then cecil said with great emotion  it is true  true on the whole she corrected full of some vague shame
true every word
it is a revelation
it isi  anyhow those are my reasons for not being your wife  he repeated the sort that can know no one intimately it is true
i fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged
i behaved like a cad to beebe and to your brother
you are even greater than i thought she withdrew a step
im not going to worry you
you are far too good to me
i shall never forget your insight and dear i only blame you for this you might have warned me in the early stages before you felt you wouldnt marry me and so have given me a chance to improve
i have never known you till this evening
i have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be
but this evening you are a different person new thoughtseven a new voice  what do you mean by a new voice she asked seized with incontrollable anger
i mean that a new person seems speaking through you said he
then she lost her balance
she cried if you think i am in love with some one else you are very much mistaken  of course i dont think that
you are not that kind lucy  oh yes you do think it
its your old idea the idea that has kept europe backi mean the idea that women are always thinking of men
if a girl breaks off her engagement everyone says oh she had someone else in her mind she hopes to get someone else its disgusting brutal
as if a girl cant break it off for the sake of freedom  he answered reverently i may have said that in the past
i shall never say it again
you have taught me better  she began to redden and pretended to examine the windows again
of course there is no question of someone else in this no jilting or any such nauseous stupidity
i beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was
i only meant that there was a force in you that i hadnt known of up till now  all right cecil that will do
dont apologize to me
it was my mistake  it is a question between ideals yours and minepure abstract ideals and yours are the nobler
i was bound up in the old vicious notions and all the time you were splendid and new his voice broke
i must actually thank you for what you have donefor showing me what i really am
solemnly i thank you for showing me a true woman
will you shake hands  of course i will said lucy twisting up her other hand in the curtains
goodnight cecil
goodbye
thats all right
im sorry about it
thank you very much for your gentleness  let me light your candle shall i  they went into the hall
thank you
goodnight again
god bless you lucy  goodbye cecil  she watched him steal upstairs while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings
on the landing he paused strong in his renunciation and gave her a look of memorable beauty
for all his culture cecil was an ascetic at heart and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it
she could never marry
in the tumult of her soul that stood firm
cecil believed in her she must some day believe in herself
she must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently who care for liberty and not for men she must forget that george loved her that george had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release that george had gone away intowhat was itthe darkness
she put out the lamp
it did not do to think nor for the matter of that to feel
she gave up trying to understand herself and joined the vast armies of the benighted who follow neither the heart nor the brain and march to their destiny by catchwords
the armies are full of pleasant and pious folk
but they have yielded to the only enemy that mattersthe enemy within
they have sinned against passion and truth and vain will be their strife after virtue
as the years pass they are censured
their pleasantry and their piety show cracks their wit becomes cynicism their unselfishness hypocrisy they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go
they have sinned against eros and against pallas athene and not by any heavenly intervention but by the ordinary course of nature those allied deities will be avenged
lucy entered this army when she pretended to george that she did not love him and pretended to cecil that she loved no one
the night received her as it had received miss bartlett thirty years before
chapter xviii lying to mr beebe mrs honeychurch freddy and the servants   windy corner lay not on the summit of the ridge but a few hundred feet down the southern slope at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill
on either side of it was a shallow ravine filled with ferns and pinetrees and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the weald
whenever mr beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth and poised in the middle of them windy cornerhe laughed
the situation was so glorious the house so commonplace not to say impertinent
the late mr honeychurch had affected the cube because it gave him the most accommodation for his money and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret shaped like a rhinoceros horn where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road
so impertinentand yet the house did for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly
other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously yet all these suggested the accidental the temporary while windy corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of natures own creation
one might laugh at the house but one never shuddered
mr beebe was bicycling over this monday afternoon with a piece of gossip
he had heard from the miss alans
these admirable ladies since they could not go to cissie villa had changed their plans
they were going to greece instead
since florence did my poor sister so much good wrote miss catharine we do not see why we should not try athens this winter
of course athens is a plunge and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread but after all we can take that with us and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train
but is there an english church and the letter went on to say i do not expect we shall go any further than athens but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at constantinople we should be so grateful  lucy would enjoy this letter and the smile with which mr beebe greeted windy corner was partly for her
she would see the fun of it and some of its beauty for she must see some beauty
though she was hopeless about pictures and though she dressed so unevenlyoh that cerise frock yesterday at churchshe must see some beauty in life or she could not play the piano as she did
he had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends that their psychology is a modern development and has not yet been understood
this theory had he known it had possibly just been illustrated by facts
ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea to see his niece and to observe whether miss honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit athens
a carriage was drawn up outside windy corner and just as he caught sight of the house it started bowled up the drive and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road
therefore it must be the horse who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him
the door opened obediently and two men emerged whom mr beebe recognized as cecil and freddy
they were an odd couple to go driving but he saw a trunk beside the coachmans legs
cecil who wore a bowler must be going away while freddy a capwas seeing him to the station
they walked rapidly taking the short cuts and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road
they shook hands with the clergyman but did not speak
so youre off for a minute mr vyse he asked
cecil said yes while freddy edged away
i was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of miss honeychurch he quoted from it
isnt it wonderful
isnt it romance
most certainly they will go to constantinople
they are taken in a snare that cannot fail
they will end by going round the world  cecil listened civilly and said he was sure that lucy would be amused and interested
isnt romance capricious
i never notice it in you young people you do nothing but play lawn tennis and say that romance is dead while the miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing
a really comfortable pension at constantinople so they call it out of decency but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn
no ordinary view will content the miss alans
they want the pension keats  im awfully sorry to interrupt mr beebe said freddy but have you any matches  i have said cecil and it did not escape mr beebes notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly
you have never met these miss alans have you mr vyse  never  then you dont see the wonder of this greek visit
i havent been to greece myself and dont mean to go and i cant imagine any of my friends going
it is altogether too big for our little lot
dont you think so
italy is just about as much as we can manage
italy is heroic but greece is godlike or devilishi am not sure which and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus
all right freddyi am not being clever upon my word i am noti took the idea from another fellow and give me those matches when youve done with them he lit a cigarette and went on talking to the two young men
i was saying if our poor little cockney lives must have a background let it be italian
big enough in all conscience
the ceiling of the sistine chapel for me
there the contrast is just as much as i can realize
but not the parthenon not the frieze of phidias at any price and here comes the victoria  youre quite right said cecil
greece is not for our little lot and he got in
freddy followed nodding to the clergyman whom he trusted not to be pulling ones leg really
and before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out and came running back for vyses matchbox which had not been returned
as he took it he said im so glad you only talked about books
cecils hard hit
lucy wont marry him
if youd gone on about her as you did about them he might have broken down  but when  late last night
i must go  perhaps they wont want me down there  nogo on
goodbye  thank goodness exclaimed mr beebe to himself and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly it was the one foolish thing she ever did
oh what a glorious riddance and after a little thought he negotiated the slope into windy corner light of heart
the house was again as it ought to becut off forever from cecils pretentious world
he would find miss minnie down in the garden
in the drawingroom lucy was tinkling at a mozart sonata
he hesitated a moment but went down the garden as requested
there he found a mournful company
it was a blustering day and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias
mrs honeychurch who looked cross was tying them up while miss bartlett unsuitably dressed impeded her with offers of assistance
at a little distance stood minnie and the gardenchild a minute importation each holding either end of a long piece of bass
oh how do you do mr beebe
gracious what a mess everything is
look at my scarlet pompoms and the wind blowing your skirts about and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in and then the carriage having to go out when i had counted on having powell whogive everyone their duedoes tie up dahlias properly  evidently mrs honeychurch was shattered
how do you do said miss bartlett with a meaning glance as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales
here lennie the bass cried mrs honeychurch
the gardenchild who did not know what bass was stood rooted to the path with horror
minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable today and that it was not her fault if dahliastrings would tear longways instead of across
come for a walk with me he told her
you have worried them as much as they can stand
mrs honeychurch i only called in aimlessly
i shall take her up to tea at the beehive tavern if i may  oh must you
yes donot the scissors thank you charlotte when both my hands are full alreadyim perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before i can get to it  mr beebe who was an adept at relieving situations invited miss bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity
yes charlotte i dont want youdo go theres nothing to stop about for either in the house or out of it  miss bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed but when she had exasperated everyone except minnie by a refusal she turned round and exasperated minnie by an acceptance
as they walked up the garden the orange cactus fell and mr beebes last vision was of the gardenchild clasping it like a lover his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom
it is terrible this havoc among the flowers he remarked
it is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment enunciated miss bartlett
perhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother
or will she come with us  i think we had better leave lucy to herself and to her own pursuits  theyre angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for breakfast whispered minnie and floyd has gone and mr vyse has gone and freddy wont play with me
in fact uncle arthur the house is not at all what it was yesterday  dont be a prig said her uncle arthur
go and put on your boots  he stepped into the drawingroom where lucy was still attentively pursuing the sonatas of mozart
she stopped when he entered
how do you do
miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at the beehive
would you come too  i dont think i will thank you  no i didnt suppose you would care to much  lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords
how delicate those sonatas are said mr beebe though at the bottom of his heart he thought them silly little things
lucy passed into schumann
miss honeychurch  yes  i met them on the hill
your brother told me  oh he did she sounded annoyed
mr beebe felt hurt for he had thought that she would like him to be told
i neednt say that it will go no further  mother charlotte cecil freddy you said lucy playing a note for each person who knew and then playing a sixth note
if youll let me say so i am very glad and i am certain that you have done the right thing  so i hoped other people would think but they dont seem to  i could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise  so does mother
mother minds dreadfully  i am very sorry for that said mr beebe with feeling
mrs honeychurch who hated all changes did mind but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended and only for the minute
it was really a ruse of lucys to justify her despondencya ruse of which she was not herself conscious for she was marching in the armies of darkness
and freddy minds  still freddy never hit it off with vyse much did he
i gathered that he disliked the engagement and felt it might separate him from you  boys are so odd  minnie could be heard arguing with miss bartlett through the floor
tea at the beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel
mr beebe saw that lucyvery properlydid not wish to discuss her action so after a sincere expression of sympathy he said i have had an absurd letter from miss alan
that was really what brought me over
i thought it might amuse you all  how delightful said lucy in a dull voice
for the sake of something to do he began to read her the letter
after a few words her eyes grew alert and soon she interrupted him with going abroad
when do they start  next week i gather  did freddy say whether he was driving straight back  no he didnt  because i do hope he wont go gossiping  so she did want to talk about her broken engagement
always complaisant he put the letter away
but she at once exclaimed in a high voice oh do tell me more about the miss alans
how perfectly splendid of them to go abroad  i want them to start from venice and go in a cargo steamer down the illyrian coast  she laughed heartily
oh delightful
i wish theyd take me  has italy filled you with the fever of travel
perhaps george emerson is right
he says that italy is only an euphuism for fate  oh not italy but constantinople
i have always longed to go to constantinople
constantinople is practically asia isnt it  mr beebe reminded her that constantinople was still unlikely and that the miss alans only aimed at athens with delphi perhaps if the roads are safe but this made no difference to her enthusiasm
she had always longed to go to greece even more it seemed
he saw to his surprise that she was apparently serious
i didnt realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends after cissie villa  oh thats nothing i assure you cissie villas nothing to me i would give anything to go with them  would your mother spare you again so soon
you have scarcely been home three months  she must spare me cried lucy in growing excitement
i simply must go away
i have to she ran her fingers hysterically through her hair
dont you see that i have to go away
i didnt realize at the timeand of course i want to see constantinople so particularly  you mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel  yes yes
i knew youd understand  mr beebe did not quite understand
why could not miss honeychurch repose in the bosom of her family
cecil had evidently taken up the dignified line and was not going to annoy her
then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying
he hinted this to her and she accepted the hint eagerly
yes of course to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down  i am afraid it has been a bothersome business he said gently
no not at all
cecil was very kind indeed onlyi had better tell you the whole truth since you have heard a littleit was that he is so masterful
i found that he wouldnt let me go my own way
he would improve me in places where i cant be improved
cecil wont let a woman decide for herselfin fact he darent
what nonsense i do talk
but that is the kind of thing  it is what i gathered from my own observation of mr vyse it is what i gather from all that i have known of you
i do sympathize and agree most profoundly
i agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism is it worth while rushing off to greece  but i must go somewhere she cried
i have been worrying all the morning and here comes the very thing she struck her knees with clenched fists and repeated i must
and the time i shall have with mother and all the money she spent on me last spring
you all think much too highly of me
i wish you werent so kind at this moment miss bartlett entered and her nervousness increased
i must get away ever so far
i must know my own mind and where i want to go  come along tea tea tea said mr beebe and bustled his guests out of the frontdoor
he hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat
when he returned for it he heard to his relief and surprise the tinkling of a mozart sonata
she is playing again he said to miss bartlett
lucy can always play was the acid reply
one is very thankful that she has such a resource
she is evidently much worried as of course she ought to be
i know all about it
the marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak  miss bartlett gave a kind of wriggle and he prepared for a discussion
he had never fathomed miss bartlett
as he had put it to himself at florence she might yet reveal depths of strangeness if not of meaning but she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable
he assumed that much and he had no hesitation in discussing lucy with her
minnie was fortunately collecting ferns
she opened the discussion with we had much better let the matter drop  i wonder  it is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in summer street
it would be death to gossip about mr vyses dismissal at the present moment  mr beebe raised his eyebrows
death is a strong wordsurely too strong
there was no question of tragedy
he said of course miss honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way and when she chooses
freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind  i know said miss bartlett civilly
yet freddy ought not to have told even you
one cannot be too careful  quite so  i do implore absolute secrecy
a chance word to a chattering friend and  exactly he was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words
a rector lives in a web of petty secrets and confidences and warnings and the wiser he is the less he will regard them
he will change the subject as did mr beebe saying cheerfully have you heard from any bertolini people lately
i believe you keep up with miss lavish
it is odd how we of that pension who seemed such a fortuitous collection have been working into one anothers lives
two three four six of usno eight i had forgotten the emersonshave kept more or less in touch
we must really give the signora a testimonial  and miss bartlett not favouring the scheme they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern
on the summit they paused
the sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in surrey
grey clouds were charging across tissues of white which stretched and shredded and tore slowly until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue
summer was retreating
the wind roared the trees groaned yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven
the weather was breaking up breaking broken and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery
mr beebes eyes rested on windy corner where lucy sat practising mozart
no smile came to his lips and changing the subject again he said we shant have rain but we shall have darkness so let us hurry on
the darkness last night was appalling  they reached the beehive tavern at about five oclock
that amiable hostelry possesses a verandah in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room and have tea at a table comfortably
mr beebe saw that miss bartlett would be cold if she sat out and that minnie would be dull if she sat in so he proposed a division of forces
they would hand the child her food through the window
thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of lucy
i have been thinking miss bartlett he said and unless you very much object i would like to reopen that discussion she bowed
nothing about the past
i know little and care less about that i am absolutely certain that it is to your cousins credit
she has acted loftily and rightly and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her
but the future
seriously what do you think of this greek plan he pulled out the letter again
i dont know whether you overheard but she wants to join the miss alans in their mad career
its alli cant explainits wrong  miss bartlett read the letter in silence laid it down seemed to hesitate and then read it again
i cant see the point of it myself  to his astonishment she replied there i cannot agree with you
in it i spy lucys salvation  really
now why  she wanted to leave windy corner  i knowbut it seems so odd so unlike her soi was going to sayselfish  it is natural surelyafter such painful scenesthat she should desire a change  here apparently was one of those points that the male intellect misses
mr beebe exclaimed so she says herself and since another lady agrees with her i must own that i am partially convinced
perhaps she must have a change
i have no sisters orand i dont understand these things
but why need she go as far as greece  you may well ask that replied miss bartlett who was evidently interested and had almost dropped her evasive manner
why greece
what is it minnie dearjam
why not tunbridge wells
oh mr beebe
i had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear lucy this morning
i cannot help her
i will say no more
perhaps i have already said too much
i am not to talk
i wanted her to spend six months with me at tunbridge wells and she refused  mr beebe poked at a crumb with his knife
but my feelings are of no importance
i know too well that i get on lucys nerves
our tour was a failure
she wanted to leave florence and when we got to rome she did not want to be in rome and all the time i felt that i was spending her mothers money  let us keep to the future though interrupted mr beebe
i want your advice  very well said charlotte with a choky abruptness that was new to him though familiar to lucy
i for one will help her to go to greece
will you  mr beebe considered
it is absolutely necessary she continued lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion an intensity that surprised him
i knowi know the darkness was coming on and he felt that this odd woman really did know
she must not stop here a moment and we must keep quiet till she goes
i trust that the servants know nothing
afterwardsbut i may have said too much already
only lucy and i are helpless against mrs honeychurch alone
if you help we may succeed
otherwise  otherwise  otherwise she repeated as if the word held finality
yes i will help her said the clergyman setting his jaw firm
come let us go back now and settle the whole thing up  miss bartlett burst into florid gratitude
the tavern signa beehive trimmed evenly with beescreaked in the wind outside as she thanked him
mr beebe did not quite understand the situation but then he did not desire to understand it nor to jump to the conclusion of another man that would have attracted a grosser mind
he only felt that miss bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form
its very vagueness spurred him into knighterrantry
his belief in celibacy so reticent so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower
they that marry do well but they that refrain do better so ran his belief and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure
in the case of lucy the feeling was intensified through dislike of cecil and he was willing to go furtherto place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity
the feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement
yet it existed and it alone explains his action subsequently and his influence on the action of others
the compact that he made with miss bartlett in the tavern was to help not only lucy but religion also
they hurried home through a world of black and grey
he conversed on indifferent topics the emersons need of a housekeeper servants italian servants novels about italy novels with a purpose could literature influence life
windy corner glimmered
in the garden mrs honeychurch now helped by freddy still wrestled with the lives of her flowers
it gets too dark she said hopelessly
this comes of putting off
we might have known the weather would break up soon and now lucy wants to go to greece
i dont know what the worlds coming to  mrs
honeychurch he said go to greece she must
come up to the house and lets talk it over
do you in the first place mind her breaking with vyse  mr
beebe im thankfulsimply thankful  so am i said freddy
good
now come up to the house  they conferred in the diningroom for half an hour
lucy would never have carried the greek scheme alone
it was expensive and dramaticboth qualities that her mother loathed
nor would charlotte have succeeded
the honours of the day rested with mr beebe
by his tact and common sense and by his influence as a clergymanfor a clergyman who was not a fool influenced mrs honeychurch greatlyhe bent her to their purpose i dont see why greece is necessary she said but as you do i suppose it is all right
it must be something i cant understand
lucy
lets tell her
lucy  she is playing the piano mr beebe said
he opened the door and heard the words of a song  look not thou on beautys charming   i didnt know that miss honeychurch sang too  sit thou still when kings are arming taste not when the winecup glistens   its a song that cecil gave her
how odd girls are  whats that called lucy stopping short
all right dear said mrs honeychurch kindly
she went into the drawingroom and mr beebe heard her kiss lucy and say i am sorry i was so cross about greece but it came on the top of the dahlias  rather a hard voice said thank you mother that doesnt matter a bit  and you are right toogreece will be all right you can go if the miss alans will have you  oh splendid
oh thank you  mr beebe followed
lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys
she was glad but he had expected greater gladness
her mother bent over her
freddy to whom she had been singing reclined on the floor with his head against her and an unlit pipe between his lips
oddly enough the group was beautiful
mr beebe who loved the art of the past was reminded of a favourite theme the santa conversazione in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble thingsa theme neither sensual nor sensational and therefore ignored by the art of today
why should lucy want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home
taste not when the winecup glistens speak not when the people listens   she continued
heres mr beebe  mr
beebe knows my rude ways  its a beautiful song and a wise one said he
go on  it isnt very good she said listlessly
i forget whyharmony or something  i suspected it was unscholarly
its so beautiful  the tunes right enough said freddy but the words are rotten
why throw up the sponge  how stupidly you talk said his sister
the santa conversazione was broken up
after all there was no reason that lucy should talk about greece or thank him for persuading her mother so he said goodbye
freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch and with his usual felicity of phrase said this has been a day and a half  stop thine ear against the singer   wait a minute she is finishing  from the red gold keep thy finger vacant heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet die   i love weather like this said freddy
mr beebe passed into it
the two main facts were clear
she had behaved splendidly and he had helped her
he could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girls life
if here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled he must acquiesce she was choosing the better part
vacant heart and hand and eye   perhaps the song stated the better part rather too strongly
he half fancied that the soaring accompanimentwhich he did not lose in the shout of the galereally agreed with freddy and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned  vacant heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet die   however for the fourth time windy corner lay poised below himnow as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness
chapter xix lying to mr emerson   the miss alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near bloomsburya clean airless establishment much patronized by provincial england
they always perched there before crossing the great seas and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes guidebooks mackintosh squares digestive bread and other continental necessaries
that there are shops abroad even in athens never occurred to them for they regarded travel as a species of warfare only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the haymarket stores
miss honeychurch they trusted would take care to equip herself duly
quinine could now be obtained in tabloids paper soap was a great help towards freshening up ones face in the train
lucy promised a little depressed
but of course you know all about these things and you have mr vyse to help you
a gentleman is such a standby  mrs honeychurch who had come up to town with her daughter began to drum nervously upon her cardcase
we think it so good of mr vyse to spare you miss catharine continued
it is not every young man who would be so unselfish
but perhaps he will come out and join you later on  or does his work keep him in london said miss teresa the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters
however we shall see him when he sees you off
i do so long to see him  no one will see lucy off interposed mrs honeychurch
she doesnt like it  no i hate seeingsoff said lucy
really
how funny
i should have thought that in this case  oh mrs honeychurch you arent going
it is such a pleasure to have met you  they escaped and lucy said with relief thats all right
we just got through that time  but her mother was annoyed
i should be told dear that i am unsympathetic
but i cannot see why you didnt tell your friends about cecil and be done with it
there all the time we had to sit fencing and almost telling lies and be seen through too i dare say which is most unpleasant  lucy had plenty to say in reply
she described the miss alans character they were such gossips and if one told them the news would be everywhere in no time
but why shouldnt it be everywhere in no time  because i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england
i shall tell them then
its much pleasanter
how wet it is
lets turn in here  here was the british museum
mrs honeychurch refused
if they must take shelter let it be in a shop
lucy felt contemptuous for she was on the tack of caring for greek sculpture and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from mr beebe to get up the names of the goddesses and gods
oh well let it be shop then
lets go to mudies
ill buy a guidebook  you know lucy you and charlotte and mr beebe all tell me im so stupid so i suppose i am but i shall never understand this holeandcorner work
youve got rid of cecilwell and good and im thankful hes gone though i did feel angry for the minute
but why not announce it
why this hushing up and tiptoeing  its only for a few days  but why at all  lucy was silent
she was drifting away from her mother
it was quite easy to say because george emerson has been bothering me and if he hears ive given up cecil may begin againquite easy and it had the incidental advantage of being true
but she could not say it
she disliked confidences for they might lead to selfknowledge and to that king of terrorslight
ever since that last evening at florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul
mrs honeychurch too was silent
she was thinking my daughter wont answer me she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with freddy and me
any rag tag and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home and as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long she burst out with youre tired of windy corner  this was perfectly true
lucy had hoped to return to windy corner when she escaped from cecil but she discovered that her home existed no longer
it might exist for freddy who still lived and thought straight but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain
she did not acknowledge that her brain was warped for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment and she was disordering the very instruments of life
she only felt i do not love george i broke off my engagement because i did not love george i must go to greece because i do not love george it is more important that i should look up gods in the dictionary than that i should help my mother everyone else is behaving very badly she only felt irritable and petulant and anxious to do what she was not expected to do and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation
oh mother what rubbish you talk
of course im not tired of windy corner  then why not say so at once instead of considering half an hour  she laughed faintly half a minute would be nearer  perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether  hush mother
people will hear you for they had entered mudies
she bought baedeker and then continued of course i want to live at home but as we are talking about it i may as well say that i shall want to be away in the future more than i have been
you see i come into my money next year  tears came into her mothers eyes
driven by nameless bewilderment by what is in older people termed eccentricity lucy determined to make this point clear
ive seen the world so littlei felt so out of things in italy
i have seen so little of life one ought to come up to london morenot a cheap ticket like today but to stop
i might even share a flat for a little with some other girl  and mess with typewriters and latchkeys exploded mrs honeychurch
and agitate and scream and be carried off kicking by the police
and call it a missionwhen no one wants you
and call it dutywhen it means that you cant stand your own home
and call it workwhen thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is
and then to prepare yourself find two doddering old ladies and go abroad with them  i want more independence said lucy lamely she knew that she wanted something and independence is a useful cry we can always say that we have not got it
she tried to remember her emotions in florence those had been sincere and passionate and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latchkeys
but independence was certainly her cue
very well
take your independence and be gone
rush up and down and round the world and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food
despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted and our dear viewand then share a flat with another girl  lucy screwed up her mouth and said perhaps i spoke hastily  oh goodness her mother flashed
how you do remind me of charlotte bartlett  charlotte flashed lucy in her turn pierced at last by a vivid pain
more every moment  i dont know what you mean mother charlotte and i are not the very least alike  well i see the likeness
the same eternal worrying the same taking back of words
you and charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters  what rubbish
and if you dislike charlotte so its rather a pity you asked her to stop
i warned you about her i begged you implored you not to but of course it was not listened to  there you go  i beg your pardon  charlotte again my dear thats all her very words  lucy clenched her teeth
my point is that you oughtnt to have asked charlotte to stop
i wish you would keep to the point and the conversation died off into a wrangle
she and her mother shopped in silence spoke little in the train little again in the carriage which met them at dorking station
it had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep surrey lanes showers of water fell from the overhanging beechtrees and rattled on the hood
lucy complained that the hood was stuffy
leaning forward she looked out into the steaming dusk and watched the carriagelamp pass like a searchlight over mud and leaves and reveal nothing beautiful
the crush when charlotte gets in will be abominable she remarked
for they were to pick up miss bartlett at summer street where she had been dropped as the carriage went down to pay a call on mr beebes old mother
we shall have to sit three a side because the trees drop and yet it isnt raining
oh for a little air then she listened to the horses hoofshe has not toldhe has not told that melody was blurred by the soft road
cant we have the hood down she demanded and her mother with sudden tenderness said very well old lady stop the horse and the horse was stopped and lucy and powell wrestled with the hood and squirted water down mrs honeychurchs neck
but now that the hood was down she did see something that she would have missedthere were no lights in the windows of cissie villa and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock
is that house to let again powell she called
yes miss he replied
have they gone  it is too far out of town for the young gentleman and his fathers rheumatism has come on so he cant stop on alone so they are trying to let furnished was the answer
they have gone then  yes miss they have gone  lucy sank back
the carriage stopped at the rectory
she got out to call for miss bartlett
so the emersons had gone and all this bother about greece had been unnecessary
waste
that word seemed to sum up the whole of life
wasted plans wasted money wasted love and she had wounded her mother
was it possible that she had muddled things away
quite possible
other people had
when the maid opened the door she was unable to speak and stared stupidly into the hall
miss bartlett at once came forward and after a long preamble asked a great favour might she go to church
mr beebe and his mother had already gone but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostesss full sanction for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more
certainly said the hostess wearily
i forgot it was friday
lets all go
powell can go round to the stables  lucy dearest  no church for me thank you  a sigh and they departed
the church was invisible but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour
this was a stained window through which some feeble light was shining and when the door opened lucy heard mr beebes voice running through the litany to a minute congregation
even their church built upon the slope of the hill so artfully with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingleeven their church had lost its charm and the thing one never talked aboutreligionwas fading like all the other things
she followed the maid into the rectory
would she object to sitting in mr beebes study
there was only that one fire
she would not object
some one was there already for lucy heard the words a lady to wait sir  old mr emerson was sitting by the fire with his foot upon a goutstool
oh miss honeychurch that you should come he quavered and lucy saw an alteration in him since last sunday
not a word would come to her lips
george she had faced and could have faced again but she had forgotten how to treat his father
miss honeychurch dear we are so sorry
george is so sorry
he thought he had a right to try
i cannot blame my boy and yet i wish he had told me first
he ought not to have tried
i knew nothing about it at all  if only she could remember how to behave
he held up his hand
but you must not scold him  lucy turned her back and began to look at mr beebes books
i taught him he quavered to trust in love
i said when love comes that is reality i said passion does not blind
no
passion is sanity and the woman you love she is the only person you will ever really understand he sighed true everlastingly true though my day is over and though there is the result
poor boy
he is so sorry
he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in that whatever you felt you did not mean
yethis voice gathered strength he spoke out to make certainmiss honeychurch do you remember italy  lucy selected a booka volume of old testament commentaries
holding it up to her eyes she said i have no wish to discuss italy or any subject connected with your son  but you do remember it  he has misbehaved himself from the first  i only was told that he loved you last sunday
i never could judge behaviour
iisuppose he has  feeling a little steadier she put the book back and turned round to him
his face was drooping and swollen but his eyes though they were sunken deep gleamed with a childs courage
why he has behaved abominably she said
i am glad he is sorry
do you know what he did  not abominably was the gentle correction
he only tried when he should not have tried
you have all you want miss honeychurch you are going to marry the man you love
do not go out of georges life saying he is abominable  no of course said lucy ashamed at the reference to cecil
abominable is much too strong
i am sorry i used it about your son
i think i will go to church after all
my mother and my cousin have gone
i shall not be so very late  especially as he has gone under he said quietly
what was that  gone under naturally he beat his palms together in silence his head fell on his chest
i dont understand  as his mother did  but mr emersonmr
emersonwhat are you talking about  when i wouldnt have george baptized said he
lucy was frightened
and she agreed that baptism was nothing but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round
she thought it a judgement he shuddered
oh horrible when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents
oh horribleworst of allworse than death when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness planted your little garden let in your sunlight and then the weeds creep in again
a judgement
and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church
is it possible miss honeychurch
shall we slip back into the darkness for ever  i dont know gasped lucy
i dont understand this sort of thing
i was not meant to understand it  but mr eagerhe came when i was out and acted according to his principles
i dont blame him or any one but by the time george was well she was ill
he made her think about sin and she went under thinking about it  it was thus that mr emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of god
oh how terrible said lucy forgetting her own affairs at last
he was not baptized said the old man
i did hold firm and he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books as ifat what costhe had won a victory over them
my boy shall go back to the earth untouched  she asked whether young mr emerson was ill  ohlast sunday he started into the present
george last sundayno not ill just gone under
he is never ill
but he is his mothers son
her eyes were his and she had that forehead that i think so beautiful and he will not think it worth while to live
it was always touch and go
he will live but he will not think it worth while to live
he will never think anything worth while
you remember that church at florence  lucy did remember and how she had suggested that george should collect postage stamps
after you left florencehorrible
then we took the house here and he goes bathing with your brother and became better
you saw him bathing  i am so sorry but it is no good discussing this affair
i am deeply sorry about it  then there came something about a novel
i didnt follow it at all i had to hear so much and he minded telling me he finds me too old
ah well one must have failures
george comes down tomorrow and takes me up to his london rooms
he cant bear to be about here and i must be where he is  mr
emerson cried the girl dont leave at least not on my account
i am going to greece
dont leave your comfortable house  it was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled
how good everyone is
and look at mr beebe housing mecame over this morning and heard i was going
here i am so comfortable with a fire  yes but you wont go back to london
its absurd  i must be with george i must make him care to live and down here he cant
he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about youi am not justifying him i am only saying what has happened  oh mr emersonshe took hold of his handyou mustnt
ive been bother enough to the world by now
i cant have you moving out of your house when you like it and perhaps losing money through itall on my account
you must stop
i am just going to greece  all the way to greece  her manner altered
to greece  so you must stop
you wont talk about this business i know
i can trust you both  certainly you can
we either have you in our lives or leave you to the life that you have chosen  i shouldnt want  i suppose mr vyse is very angry with george
no it was wrong of george to try
we have pushed our beliefs too far
i fancy that we deserve sorrow  she looked at the books againblack brown and that acrid theological blue
they surrounded the visitors on every side they were piled on the tables they pressed against the very ceiling
to lucy who could not see that mr emerson was profoundly religious and differed from mr beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passionit seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum when he was unhappy and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman
more certain than ever that she was tired he offered her his chair
no please sit still
i think i will sit in the carriage  miss honeychurch you do sound tired  not a bit said lucy with trembling lips
but you are and theres a look of george about you
and what were you saying about going abroad  she was silent
greeceand she saw that he was thinking the word overgreece but you were to be married this year i thought  not till january it wasnt said lucy clasping her hands
would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point
i suppose that mr vyse is going with you
i hopeit isnt because george spoke that you are both going  no  i hope that you will enjoy greece with mr vyse  thank you  at that moment mr beebe came back from church
his cassock was covered with rain
thats all right he said kindly
i counted on you two keeping each other company
its pouring again
the entire congregation which consists of your cousin your mother and my mother stands waiting in the church till the carriage fetches it
did powell go round  i think so ill see  noof course ill see
how are the miss alans  very well thank you  did you tell mr emerson about greece  ii did  dont you think it very plucky of her mr emerson to undertake the two miss alans
now miss honeychurch go backkeep warm
i think three is such a courageous number to go travelling and he hurried off to the stables
he is not going she said hoarsely
i made a slip
mr vyse does stop behind in england  somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man
to george to cecil she would have lied again but he seemed so near the end of things so dignified in his approach to the gulf of which he gave one account and the books that surrounded him another so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed that the true chivalrynot the wornout chivalry of sex but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the oldawoke in her and at whatever risk she told him that cecil was not her companion to greece
and she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty and he lifting his eyes said you are leaving him
you are leaving the man you love  ii had to  why miss honeychurch why  terror came over her and she lied again
she made the long convincing speech that she had made to mr beebe and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more
he heard her in silence and then said my dear i am worried about you
it seems to medreamily she was not alarmedthat you are in a muddle  she shook her head
take an old mans word theres nothing worse than a muddle in all the world
it is easy to face death and fate and the things that sound so dreadful
it is on my muddles that i look back with horroron the things that i might have avoided
we can help one another but little
i used to think i could teach young people the whole of life but i know better now and all my teaching of george has come down to this beware of muddle
do you remember in that church when you pretended to be annoyed with me and werent
do you remember before when you refused the room with the view
those were muddleslittle but ominousand i am fearing that you are in one now she was silent
dont trust me miss honeychurch
though life is very glorious it is difficult she was still silent
life wrote a friend of mine is a public performance on the violin in which you must learn the instrument as you go along i think he puts it well
man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes alongespecially the function of love then he burst out excitedly thats it thats what i mean
you love george and after his long preamble the three words burst against lucy like waves from the open sea
but you do he went on not waiting for contradiction
you love the boy body and soul plainly directly as he loves you and no other word expresses it
you wont marry the other man for his sake  how dare you gasped lucy with the roaring of waters in her ears
oh how like a mani mean to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man  but you are  she summoned physical disgust
youre shocked but i mean to shock you
its the only hope at times
i can reach you no other way
you must marry or your life will be wasted
you have gone too far to retreat
i have no time for the tenderness and the comradeship and the poetry and the things that really matter and for which you marry
i know that with george you will find them and that you love him
then be his wife
he is already part of you
though you fly to greece and never see him again or forget his very name george will work in your thoughts till you die
it isnt possible to love and to part
you will wish that it was
you can transmute love ignore it muddle it but you can never pull it out of you
i know by experience that the poets are right love is eternal  lucy began to cry with anger and though her anger passed away soon her tears remained
i only wish poets would say this too love is of the body not the body but of the body
ah
the misery that would be saved if we confessed that
ah
for a little directness to liberate the soul
your soul dear lucy
i hate the word now because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round
but we have souls
i cannot say how they came nor whither they go but we have them and i see you ruining yours
i cannot bear it
it is again the darkness creeping in it is hell then he checked himself
what nonsense i have talkedhow abstract and remote
and i have made you cry
dear girl forgive my prosiness marry my boy
when i think what life is and how seldom love is answered by lovemarry him it is one of the moments for which the world was made  she could not understand him the words were indeed remote
yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn veil after veil and she saw to the bottom of her soul
then lucy  youve frightened me she moaned
cecilmr
beebethe tickets boughteverything she fell sobbing into the chair
im caught in the tangle
i must suffer and grow old away from him
i cannot break the whole of life for his sake
they trusted me  a carriage drew up at the frontdoor
give george my loveonce only
tell him muddle then she arranged her veil while the tears poured over her cheeks inside
lucy  nothey are in the halloh please not mr emersonthey trust me  but why should they when you have deceived them  mr beebe opened the door saying heres my mother  youre not worthy of their trust  whats that said mr beebe sharply
i was saying why should you trust her when she deceived you  one minute mother he came in and shut the door
i dont follow you mr emerson
to whom do you refer
trust whom  i mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george
they have loved one another all along  mr beebe looked at the sobbing girl
he was very quiet and his white face with its ruddy whiskers seemed suddenly inhuman
a long black column he stood and awaited her reply
i shall never marry him quavered lucy
a look of contempt came over him and he said why not  mr
beebei have misled youi have misled myself  oh rubbish miss honeychurch  it is not rubbish said the old man hotly
its the part of people that you dont understand  mr beebe laid his hand on the old mans shoulder pleasantly
lucy
lucy called voices from the carriage
mr
beebe could you help me  he looked amazed at the request and said in a low stern voice i am more grieved than i can possibly express
it is lamentable lamentableincredible  whats wrong with the boy fired up the other again
nothing mr emerson except that he no longer interests me
marry george miss honeychurch
he will do admirably  he walked out and left them
they heard him guiding his mother upstairs
lucy the voices called
she turned to mr emerson in despair
but his face revived her
it was the face of a saint who understood
now it is all dark
now beauty and passion seem never to have existed
i know
but remember the mountains over florence and the view
ah dear if i were george and gave you one kiss it would make you brave
you have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth out into the muddle that you have made yourself and your mother and all your friends will despise you oh my darling and rightly if it is ever right to despise
george still dark all the tussle and the misery without a word from him
am i justified into his own eyes tears came
yes for we fight for more than love or pleasure there is truth
truth counts truth does count  you kiss me said the girl
you kiss me
i will try  he gave her a sense of deities reconciled a feeling that in gaining the man she loved she would gain something for the whole world
throughout the squalor of her homeward driveshe spoke at oncehis salutation remained
he had robbed the body of its taint the worlds taunts of their sting he had shown her the holiness of direct desire
she never exactly understood she would say in after years how he managed to strengthen her
it was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once     chapter xx the end of the middle ages   the miss alans did go to greece but they went by themselves
they alone of this little company will double malea and plough the waters of the saronic gulf
they alone will visit athens and delphi and either shrine of intellectual songthat upon the acropolis encircled by blue seas that under parnassus where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity
trembling anxious cumbered with much digestive bread they did proceed to constantinople they did go round the world
the rest of us must be contented with a fair but a less arduous goal
italiam petimus we return to the pension bertolini
george said it was his old room
no it isnt said lucy because it is the room i had and i had your fathers room
i forget why charlotte made me for some reason  he knelt on the tiled floor and laid his face in her lap
george you baby get up  why shouldnt i be a baby murmured george
unable to answer this question she put down his sock which she was trying to mend and gazed out through the window
it was evening and again the spring
oh bother charlotte she said thoughtfully
what can such people be made of  same stuff as parsons are made of  nonsense  quite right
it is nonsense  now you get up off the cold floor or youll be starting rheumatism next and you stop laughing and being so silly  why shouldnt i laugh he asked pinning her with his elbows and advancing his face to hers
whats there to cry at
kiss me here he indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome
he was a boy after all
when it came to the point it was she who remembered the past she into whose soul the iron had entered she who knew whose room this had been last year
it endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong
any letters he asked
just a line from freddy  now kiss me here then here  then threatened again with rheumatism he strolled to the window opened it as the english will and leant out
there was the parapet there the river there to the left the beginnings of the hills
the cabdriver who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent might be that very phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago
a passion of gratitudeall feelings grow to passions in the southcame over the husband and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool
he had helped himself it is true but how stupidly
all the fighting that mattered had been done by othersby italy by his father by his wife
lucy you come and look at the cypresses and the church whatever its name is still shows  san miniato
ill just finish your sock  signorino domani faremo uno giro called the cabman with engaging certainty
george told him that he was mistaken they had no money to throw away on driving
and the people who had not meant to helpthe miss lavishes the cecils the miss bartletts
ever prone to magnify fate george counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment
anything good in freddys letter  not yet  his own content was absolute but hers held bitterness the honeychurches had not forgiven them they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy she had alienated windy corner perhaps for ever
what does he say  silly boy
he thinks hes being dignified
he knew we should go off in the springhe has known it for six monthsthat if mother wouldnt give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands
they had fair warning and now he calls it an elopement
ridiculous boy  signorino domani faremo uno giro  but it will all come right in the end
he has to build us both up from the beginning again
i wish though that cecil had not turned so cynical about women
he has for the second time quite altered
why will men have theories about women
i havent any about men
i wish too that mr beebe  you may well wish that  he will never forgive usi mean he will never be interested in us again
i wish that he did not influence them so much at windy corner
i wish he hadntbut if we act the truth the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run  perhaps then he said more gently well i acted the truththe only thing i did doand you came back to me
so possibly you know he turned back into the room
nonsense with that sock he carried her to the window so that she too saw all the view
they sank upon their knees invisible from the road they hoped and began to whisper one anothers names
ah
it was worth while it was the great joy that they had expected and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt
they were silent
signorino domani faremo  oh bother that man  but lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said no dont be rude to him then with a catching of her breath she murmured mr
eager and charlotte dreadful frozen charlotte
how cruel she would be to a man like that  look at the lights going over the bridge  but this room reminds me of charlotte
how horrible to grow old in charlottes way
to think that evening at the rectory that she shouldnt have heard your father was in the house
for she would have stopped me going in and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense
you couldnt have made me
when i am very happyshe kissed himi remember on how little it all hangs
if charlotte had only known she would have stopped me going in and i should have gone to silly greece and become different for ever  but she did know said george she did see my father surely
he said so  oh no she didnt see him
she was upstairs with old mrs beebe dont you remember and then went straight to the church
she said so  george was obstinate again
my father said he saw her and i prefer his word
he was dozing by the study fire and he opened his eyes and there was miss bartlett
a few minutes before you came in
she was turning to go as he woke up
he didnt speak to her  then they spoke of other thingsthe desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another and whose reward is to rest quietly in each others arms
it was long ere they returned to miss bartlett but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting
george who disliked any darkness said its clear that she knew
then why did she risk the meeting
she knew he was there and yet she went to church  they tried to piece the thing together
as they talked an incredible solution came into lucys mind
she rejected it and said how like charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment but something in the dying evening in the roar of the river in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life and george whispered or did she mean it  mean what  signorino domani faremo uno giro  lucy bent forward and said with gentleness lascia prego lascia
siamo sposati  scusi tanto signora he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse
buona serae grazie  niente  the cabman drove away singing
mean what george  he whispered is it this
is this possible
ill put a marvel to you
that your cousin has always hoped
that from the very first moment we met she hoped far down in her mind that we should be like thisof course very far down
that she fought us on the surface and yet she hoped
i cant explain her any other way
can you
look how she kept me alive in you all the summer how she gave you no peace how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable
the sight of us haunted heror she couldnt have described us as she did to her friend
there are detailsit burnt
i read the book afterwards
she is not frozen lucy she is not withered up all through
she tore us apart twice but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy
we can never make friends with her or thank her
but i do believe that far down in her heart far below all speech and behaviour she is glad  it is impossible murmured lucy and then remembering the experiences of her own heart she said noit is just possible  youth enwrapped them the song of phaethon announced passion requited love attained
but they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this
the song died away they heard the river bearing down the snows of winter into the mediterranean
